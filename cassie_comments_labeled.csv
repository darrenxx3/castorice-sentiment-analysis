they clearly felt the cold water during beta anaxa had a global passive that gave like lvls to basic attacks to everyone but after people complained they removed that one and left cas,NEGATIVE,0.9991220831871033,0
after playing the story i still think the global passive didnt have to exist while castorice does go through her arc to understand the value of life death and save the tb thats it she even says its a one time exception for our tb so having a revive as an ingame global passive is still a weird choice it could been really funny if it only worked for tb,NEGATIVE,0.9915647506713867,0
it is broken as the reason most showcases achieve cycle in moc will likely be due to the global passive saving their sustain less team,NEGATIVE,0.9990861415863037,0

i dont really mind the passives even if they are global if i cant pull the character im not going to bankrupt myself just to get the character anything that can help my skill issue or survivability is a welcomed addition but i can see why other players see this as a bad thing some people have poor financial thinking and try to get them anyway,NEGATIVE,0.9861592650413513,0
im not having castorice and paying more attention to situations where her passive whould have saved my run happens frequently i play sustainless a lot there are teams which lack for example exact one additional turn or there are a lot of healing machanics in apoc now so her passive really influences overall account results im pretty sure people with castorice on acc have overall better results couse it is really much more doable to play sustainless with her im already feeling the diff between me and castorice havers and what if it worsens with the other global passives,NEGATIVE,0.9973922967910767,0

hoyo is a business and the game is easy enough to clear without global passives its weird to complain about this in a single player game just pull on the characters you like and youll still be fine,POSITIVE,0.9993939399719238,1
ok this comment section is really starting to bug me no matter what you say a single revive a battle will never be op if you need it you are likely to weak to do the end game any way even with the passive,NEGATIVE,0.9973264932632446,0
i was wondering what a globle passive was so if its just a char can do things while not on the team then i dont think thats bad meta wise its broken but this game has no pvp so its not really breaking anything but this game has terrible balancing of new enemies and constantly add new mechanics that older players or none meta players arent going to have fun the whiplash i got when i got silverwolf who was deem broken just to come back now to find out ill need every new buffer or some sort of follow up something to do enough damage just to beat some multiplying bug or scorpion thing and watch my units fail to even do half the dps these new ones do will always mind boggle me,NEGATIVE,0.9975091218948364,0
global passive is good as long as they dont balance enemies with them in mind this should just be a nice little bonus to players who have characters with a passive and not as an excuse to make bump up the powercreep even further,POSITIVE,0.9889940619468689,1
here is my take i cannot finish my current moc with adventurine or fu xuan on the team i got blown up and my tank are both es you can say that i do not a good build but i counter it that the timing of this global passive and definitely suspicious nothing nothing aside from profit stopping from hoyoverse giving us castorice for free i too am looking forward other characters especially star character with global passive now how long do we need to wait are they as strong as star global passive,NEGATIVE,0.993208110332489,0

everyone knew that castorice would be ridiculously powerful the global passive seems like hoyoverses self fulfilling prophecy wouldnt be surprised if they pull a castorices banner was successful so this means players are ok with global passives out of their ass a global passive is inherently scummy im surprised youre defending it,NEGATIVE,0.9913357496261597,0

revives are bad because they take up power budget on something that shouldnt even come up when trying to ride the line of lategame damage pushing having a free you dont need to budget for this revive you just get it is dramatic and i think this is going to be looked at as the moment hsrs powercreep became exponential,NEGATIVE,0.9996833801269531,0
the way the devs are treating castorice is kinda making me dislike her and it really isnt the characters fault,NEGATIVE,0.994142472743988,0
i agree with you and i expect that this is a one thing with castorice or that if other characters have a global passive is a small one like more money at the end of the battle or the enemy doesnt detect you in the overworld and doesnt break the game but if i see that a new character comes out and have a really game changing passive more atk crit spd etc i will be the first one to truly be mad about it and yes i know that according to the leaks phainon supossesdly will have a global passive but lets not forget that leaks are not always right straight up lies or just ideas that came up during the creation phase of a character that ends up being eliminated lets not forget that we had leaks of screwllum being playabel since x and it not in the game yet but i do think that we should raise or voice and say loud and clearly that we just want this to be a one time thing or that the passive will be small and doesnt really affect combat in a significant way besides i think that the backlash that the game is recieving will tell hoyo that we dont want this global passives or that if ends up being included then all the characters need to have global passives example all destruction characters have break effect all hunt crit rate etc and you can only active a small amount at the same timelike or at the same time for the moment i will be kepping a close eye in what hoyo wants to do and acting accordingly,NEGATIVE,0.998170018196106,0
even with castorices revive youd still be death in moc both sides attack very frequently and she rezz you back with hp or hp,NEGATIVE,0.9240520000457764,0
you are under the assumption i never cleared it and i did eventually i do need to figure out how to clear the second half and its annoying now i need to try more times than usual i also cleared it on beta too with castorice and possibly mydei separately i either use mydei tribe or anaxa castorice but not all hoyoverse is not dumb they dont release characters with useless global passive especially star we used to talk about how star is optional and i bet you can still make this argument too because somewhere someone can still clear it using only star not me and i dont have this much time,NEGATIVE,0.9967886209487915,0
i think the problem with this passive is for me personally is that its just another giant thing on the pileup of things that make me feel like hoyoverse doesnt respect me as a player its not even just hsr my view towards hoyo has soured so significantly through their choices with genshin and now it feels like its been happening a lot in hsr its just im tired man i dont even want to play zz because even though currently theres nothing really wrong with it i just dont trust hoyo anymore and castorices passive is just like man they got so much feedback about how its great when shes on the team but dont make it global and they just once again ignored everything i feel very slighted and i no longer wish to play their games which sucks because i do still think theyre the best when it comes to character visual design and music im not qutting hsr yet but im truly on the fringe now its the last hoyo game i still actually play and honestly i dont know how much longer i will enjoy it for,NEGATIVE,0.9926907420158386,0
not the end of the world yet they designed the ui and mechanics they will probably release more theyre testing the waters and given hoyos track record it will continue regardless of feedback if it ends up being good for profit even if the worst for this doesnt happen theres still so many other issues that have yet to be resolved and they do not communicate that they intend to solve any of them i love this game but its so hard to play and enjoy,NEGATIVE,0.9979937076568604,0

people are so caught up with bs that everyone is losing focus on the things that really matter doesnt matter if hsr or any game in existence is moba pve pvp single player or whatfuckingever matter of fact is that every game has rules and mechanisms that differentiate it from other games and maintains the structure and enjoyment of a game hsr has broken its own rules over and over and over and it doesnt matter how you take it hoyo has fundementally broken hsrs mechanic without justification or reason again it doesnt matter if youre okay with or not or youre a hoyohater or a shil objectively in an equation hsrs formula has received changes and now it is unbalanced it is fundamentally flawed now and yes thats a bad thing if youre okay with it good for you but if theres a problem it should be addressed despite who feels like what about it tldr if youre not happy with hsr its fine if youre not happy thats also fine because the real matter at hand is that hoyo has altered the rules of game unjustly and thats the real issue weakness break weakness implant global passive not how we feel or think it isnt really the fact that global passives alone are an issue even though they should be the real issue is that hoyo has been dragging hsr down for months now weve lost so much faith and have been fed so much shit that we cant help but feel like the game will just get worse even though that has yet to happen i dont like to be pessimistic just for the sake of it but i cant look back at hoyos track record and back them up and it shows in the community yes people are going bonkers over the global passive even though they shouldnt at least not yet but the fact of the matter is that most people are frustrated and just hope for the worst every time a change is implemented im not talking about doomers or baiters but just genuine normal players tldr peoples outrage is justified since hoyo has been giving us nothing bad changes for almost a year now and people are just acting out naturally theres really nothing to complain here because thats just how people would react if all they are getting are bad news theyll exaggerate the issue and brace for impact all this doesnt matter because hoyo will get away with it unless people collectively move over to next big thing after gacha or something just take hoyo by storm or something drastic and unforeseen happens there will always be people wholl take whatever hoyo gives doesnt matter who these people are and why they do it but the majority will always take it i myself am playing the game so im no one different so unless the world becomes a perfect system were going to get whatever hoyo will serve tldr hoyo will do whatever they want and well take it unless something overtakes hoyo well be just subjected to this,NEGATIVE,0.9994080066680908,0

correction your unit will not die again while your units are under the effect of her passive they are immune to death until healed shielded or the autodeath two turns later so many people overlook this fact and is why her passive is actually pretty op and is a problem to be global among the other problems of it being global also need i remind people of the clip where hoolay cycled a full team you cant do anything in that situation having castorice there means you dont get cycled and get another chance to actually win espeically when the revived characters are immune to death for two turns shes going to become essential so that things like that just dont happen,NEGATIVE,0.9919236302375793,0

yours is genuinely the only normal response to this ive seen like i get it i get that hyv probably doesnt have a good track record in peoples eyes but the hypotheticals are getting annoying they previously stated they liked making the anniversary characters super strong or something like that it may never exist in another character or if they do i doubt they will mess with stats because people speed tune etc their characters in this game and that would affect too much i also agree that mydeis forced auto is way more of a problem since it fully affects the way the player actually plays ahem or cant play the game i saw many claim that mydei being uncontrollable makes sense because of spoiler for gaining the power he did i think this is a poor argument because throughout the end of the quest he remains entirely reasonable and in control he only implies a future loss of control and only ever alludes to this intense fury when in phainons version of the trial and nikador is egging him on even in his own for the trailer he got he didnt actually look out of control ever also jingliu and bladie should also be uncontrollable retroactively then castorices ability implies that during this patch she very well might get the coreflame of death which would mean she lowkey controls who lives or dies if we really go deep into the lore you can think of it like castorice is a kind person and wouldnt want us or our friends to die but because balance is required for life and death she can only revive to hp and if theyre meant to stay alive preservation or abundance will protectheal them otherwise they still die and the balance of death continues i say this because even if shes kind i think she very well understands that people and things do need to die eventually it seems that starting with mydei they really wanted to go for lore abilities for their kits to a new level i mean everyone complained about mydeis auto feature before he was released and even after every post related to him was full of comments to remove it before release especially because they only avoided mentioning it in the english stream honestly i think this decision is worse for him because at e you can only control his ult which is a bummer for people like me who never play on auto its such an odd choice when we already had characters this would apply to and they dont have anything like this its interesting from a design choice but poor from player experience perspective its a glorified followup attack godslayer be god specifically that isnt treated as one anyway for castorice too i think its interesting from a design perspective but even though i personally do not mind it because this is a single player pve game the largely negative reaction shows that from the player perspective its a poor choice my real question is why dont the others aglaea tribbie anaxa have something in their kit that is like this a possible drawback something related to their lore that impacts the way their kit works i guess they might be harder to think of stuff for but still that part seems imbalanced to me im not gonna get on my high horse about it sets a bad precedent because its their game and they can do what they want theyll think theyre allowed to do this again its their game what if they put an insane gp on a character you hate i will never pull for a character i do not like they may never do another gp again and fearmongering for the hypothetical future gps being required when we dont know where else this may take us is a bit much for me i get why people are worried about this hypothetical but even castorices doesnt look required so idk why people are saying not having these characters will brick their accounts the lack of s with good kits is bricking the game way more than this imo because you have few to no alternatives for the abundance of limited,NEGATIVE,0.9992196559906006,0

ngl if hsr want to really sell a character that isnt overpowered they can by incorporating proper characterization to the character refined face animations during dialogue high quality model impactful and memorable part in the story etc i dont know if hoyo is just blind and deaf but most people will whale if the character have interesting traits rather than their kit being broken but what do players expect hoyoverse being hoyoslop they are pushing this extreme laziness that they had and induce fomo in a global passive instead literally generating money through wall of text instead of putting effort to actual story content if castorice sells well this just sets a precedent to hoyo that being lazy is okay and they can milk their players whenever they want and saying that it would be a problem once they added combat related global passive is just not it do people not realize how silver wolf sets a precedence to characters applying weakness break whenever they want or acheron having broken multipliers that dps units after her became absurdly broken as well why do people still think that this wont be a problem if they already did it the second time what the saying fool me once shame on me fool me twice shame on you is not enough people still want hoyo to fool them thrice holi hoyo players are sadistic af,NEGATIVE,0.9975829124450684,0

it was never about the revive thingy or other additional stats it gives the main problem was the idea of global passive itself most player think thats its alright since the effect it gives is minimal wc is true but its shouldnt be look based on castorice herself it should be look collectively this gives the precedent to release units w global passives its wouldnt be done consecutively but slowly hoyo isnt dumb theyre testing waters,NEGATIVE,0.9950892329216003,0

personally i disagree with a few points even if the devs are going to be making future global passive buffs but theyre miniscule like say a very minor stat buff of attack increase these can all stack and the devs will factor all of these global buffs into their endgame content and possibly even future characters kits and balance it around them which of course makes the hp inflation and powercreeping even worse than it is to also tell players that feel they have been disrespected by the game to just quit is terrible advice because that is not going to change the game for the better or make it improve this is only good advice to those that feel hsr has crossed a line and they cant continue with it anymore and you should have phrased that better additionally saying that hoyo could have ruined the game at any point by adding predatory pay to win mechanics because they know can get away with it and saying the passive worth stressing over is incredibly short sighted and not providing any solutions to the powercreep situation not to mention considering hoyo is seen to be the top mobile gacha company that every other gacha game is striving to take even a of their profits whose to say this wouldnt trickle down to future gacha games and become a trend and before anyone says that those games would be eosd after genshins release there started having an influx of copycat games with the similar concepts and copy pasting the relic system with its shitty layers of rng which many players complained to be a shitty mechanic but now its a trend last of all what if those global passives introduces some unbalanced mechanic unrelated to stat increases but still affecting combat gameplay its definitely possible lets assume this when insert _ is in the team increase hits on every allys ultimate attacks by meaning acherons ult for example would be doing attacks on her ult instead of her usual its still a terrible precedent to set because it opens up way too many bad mechanics that can break even more of hsrs rules,NEGATIVE,0.9996445178985596,0

the thing that worries me is that hsrs gameplay is very simple as they release more global passives it will be hard to avoid either actual buff that improve a teams performance by a decent amount they could always thread the needle but its fucking hoyo soo synergy between seemingly innocuous global passives that then makes them much more powerful when you own a certain combination of characters say hyacines passive gives a party wide heal whenever someone dies which allows a character revived by cas passive to not die again even if you dont have a sustain either way its introducing more potential problems when devs should be focusing on fixing existing problems if hoyo had accrued a good reputation when it comes to managing things that can introduce fomo and treated players fairly overall i would not be overly worried about this but again its hoyo mark my words well soon see a boss that can oneshot a party member without fail unless you interact with a very annoying mechanic of said boss and youll watch every cas owner just shrug it off regardless of the team they play while the others will scramble to deal with it or have to use fucking bailu,NEGATIVE,0.5271294116973877,0

while i agree with of what you said everybody here is missing one crucial detail the western community makes up the vast minority of the playerbase with the vast majority of the complaints if you look at the things that did get addressed and changed it were all things that cn players complained about portrayel of story enhanced through animations hard moc nikador mechanics are so abusable im sorry tackled by reducing total hp in the next one buffs to older characters to balance out powercreep etc we are not the target audience as stupid of an arguement as it may sound the cn players love their exclusive stuff and if you go look at their comments about our reactions they are mostly making fun of us xd their reaction to the global was also rather positive of course with some concerned for the future but nothing close to the wide spread hopeless doomposting we are experiencing here there is obviously the big evil what if hanging in the air and i totally understand that but who here is actually stupid enough to think they would do that when madam hertas and acherons techniques have more total value to your account than this global passive and some entire character kits combined and i saw no complaints about those if they wanted to add this into the game or market future characters more efficiently they got a ton of other way less controversial methods of doing that the passive is so ridiculously useless due to needing a heal otherwise you automatically die on the next turn its only there for flaire the reason i am commenting so negatively over something so seemingly reasonable is because its becoming really exhausting to see all this doomposting and negativity achieve literally nothing but ruin the enjoyment of others trust the devs a little more hoyo is not a multi billion dollar corporation for nothing and if you cant trust them because there is nothing to trust them for then dont interact with their products and quit the game its that easy,NEGATIVE,0.9996680021286011,0
i think whats important to notice at is the way they are testing the waters by masking the passive under tons of layers as youre saying its just a tiny thing in her kit that is already so hyped she is a highly anticipated waifu and with some of the best animations in the game and i think this is hoyos strategy testing the waters by attaching a passive under many many layers of possible playerbases defenses its a very insignificant effect no big deal its because of lore how dare you criticize my waifu if they tested the waters by giving global passive to a character thats not desirable people would raise pitchforks on top of that its anniversary and they are giving lots of other things like giving freebies free stars everything to shift the focus away from the passive and its clearly working of course this is a pessimistic look but i dont know if we can trust that hoyo wont follow through on this to open the floodgates with castorice where people will even defend it and then start selling less hyped characters just on their passives another reason why im pessimistic is that this reminds me a ton about another situation that already happened in star rail that we are suffering from right now ruan mei was stupidly busted even on release raising the damage floor of pretty much all teams in the game if you complained about her power back then youd be shunned its no big deal its only the first limited harmony unit so she has to be strong it makes sense lorewise how dare you criticize a woman that virtually touched me shut up were getting free ratio and then suddenly hp creep happens making not using rm feel like shit and then acheron happens and then robin firefly feixiao herta waves of hp inflation oh and now were complaining about powercreep powercreep wasnt a big deal either when ruan mei released according to some people of course does the global passive situation have to follow the same course not necessarily but it can go downhill easily if they decide to and they are clearly pushing the boundaries with this one,NEGATIVE,0.9951558113098145,0

you might not be a shill but youd be a moron to think this isnt a problem better make a video saying you were wrong when they start adding more of these global passives her revive is still a literal problem it could potentially change the way you play example you find yourself in a situation where the character your controlling could die and the safe bet would be to use sp and kill the remaining mob but you see the potential in doing a basic to bank more sp thus you basic and get the sp and die the person with castorice on their account has the option to snag that sp and let the character die even if it cost sp later to get them alive its still banking it for a time that better suits them the person without castorice doesnt has a bigger gamble on their hands,NEGATIVE,0.9982141256332397,0
the problem isnt that the account wide passive res isnt that powerful in the current meta yes if you have a fully leveled and built team then if they die in endgame content youre doing something wrong or got unlucky the problem is if and when endgame changes to reflect the global passives we already see this happening with the aoe meta hamstringing hunt characters now you have to have the passive revive buff because theres a mechanic where the boss oneshots you or the boss dmg numbers are so high your sustain cant keep up with it and i mean premium sustains like aventurine and lingsha i was and am much more worried about the global passive than something like mydeis autobattle because his autobattle didnt actually affect his viability as a dps in the content hes intended for at e the worst part is i dont even think this will change how much money they get the vast majority of people will still pull for the same amount of characters but now theyre forced to choose between pulling for a meta character they dont like because if they dont they wont clear endgame or pulling for a character they loved and falling behind,NEGATIVE,0.9995546936988831,0
this is what i keep telling people who are doomposting over it they wont add offensive or flat stat global passives they are a profit company and they should know that adding those would be too greedy theyre trying to limit test to see how much they can get away with and with recent backlash they know that global passives are not it people are blowing it out of proportion,NEGATIVE,0.9985639452934265,0

no this is exactly the beginning of the end dont you dare to sugar coat it by saying its not they in their enourmous greed really said how can we make more money oh i know lets do a genshin will this decission piss off players we dont care we want money they had chances to say maybe its not a great idea to implement this type of mechanic into a game already filled with powercreep that makes any mmo tremble but no they dove head first into this decision toghether with every castorice simp and people who dont understand that this change is beyond bad this game already has a huge issue with the powercreep units that do everything like its a normal tuesday bosses with almost million hp by now and no viable star options besides march and gallagher its so bad that they are forced yet again to bait these brainless and spinless players with a free star now and another in the future are all of you who are defending this thing by saying oh its just pve get over it really that idiotic if yes i hate to break it to you you are idiots i just hope the eu enforces those laws against predatory monetization and knocks these types of companies down a few meters into the mud to stop i will really want to see who is gonna spend in these games anymore when you see the prices of the pulls,NEGATIVE,0.9997543692588806,0
for me well ive already taken a long break from the game on account of the lack of english voice acting that said the issue with powercreep and this global passive is incredibly worrying ive invested so much time and money into this game and its a shame to see it go down a route that seems incredibly predatory im hoping youre right and this ends up not being that big of a deal its just that it seems like yet another step in the wrong direction,NEGATIVE,0.9997243285179138,0

idk if anyone will read my comment or not but im going to say it anyway where hsr may go is probably the same track with hird where powercreep is at its worst and old s ranks star equivalent characters are not only unusable but literally forgotten to the point hoyo gives them for free it has already started with ruan mei and luocha and they will probably continue for me global buffs are definitely broken and maybe should not be in the game and i will agree if it is the case for a game with pvp feature the thing is hsr is a single player game and theres literally no need for competitiveness to enjoy it so global buffs meant nothing but having an easier time clearing endgame contents if youre worried about not getting every jades from moc apoc and pf then get what you can and strategize your pull no ones forcing you to pull every characters no ones forcing you to top up and no ones forcing you to clear every endgame content so just do your own thing in it ans if you dont enjoy it anymore just leave it if you ask me what if in the future hoyo releass a global buff to increase critspdatketc will i pull for all of them then my answer is no i will not pull all of them i will still pull only the characters i want and like like i said no ones forcing you to have meta characters and you dont have to clear every endgame content i will keep enjoy it in my own way i literally dont understand this drama cause why are you all worrying when you dont even need to be competitive in this game and castorice will probably get powercreep again in the future this is a gacha game with honkai in its title if you dont play hi then just know that the powercreep is gonna get worse so be prepared and do your math for your pulls because i do i am mostly fp except for getting monthly once every a few couple of months so i have to calculate my pulls and truly think which character i want to prioritize theres no such thing as a must pull character only a collectively agreed overpowered character that meta slave player use to compare their accounts with other to make themselves feel better for having the character once again you dont need to clear endgame content theres no rule or prerequisites that mention such thing if youre worried about not getting enough jades strategize your pull its as simple as that,NEGATIVE,0.9993208646774292,0

i generally agree with this sentiment it was an inevitability that theyd try this at some point if that was their intention castorice just happened to be the one they tried it on and its not like they need to see how players will respond considering the company were talking about but i cant help but think if its true they did this because it thematically fits the character couldnt they have given this global passive as a reward for clearing the story like a castorices blessing key item that or give the character for free for those who are playing the patch to allow a more equal playing field tying it to if you gamble and either get lucky or invest enough to guarantee a pull sets a pretty sketchy precedent i hope in the event they include more global passives like this one theyre very minor things that dont provide too strong an advantage but i doubt it,NEGATIVE,0.9932344555854797,0

i perused through the comments and it feels like of the people are commenting based on the title alone so many bring up points that were already addressed in the video we all understand the precedent this sets theres no need to make a comment separately pointing it out the point of this is that at this very moment the global passive is inconsequential as this video points out hoyo could ruin the game even more than they already have at any point in time these gacha devs are not benevolent saints they do not care about player satisfaction beyond the bare minimum required to keep them hooked if the game is no longer enjoyable for whatever reason i urge people to quit at the end of the day this is a luxury entertainment product this game is not a contractual obligation anyone can uninstall the game within seconds and never touch it again and thats why i agree with this video that endlessly worrying about what could be is just needlessly exhausting in the video states but if a new character comes out with a damage buff global passive id draw the line there and i am in agreement even the most minuscule damage or stat buff whether it be atk crit res pen or even break effect or effect res and that is where id firmly draw the line of it being unacceptable no matter how small a direct stat buff would be completely unacceptable and i would forever quit the game i love minmaxing with relics and stats in this game so the idea of a direct global stat buff from a character disgusts me and yes i know about the rumors of several upcoming characters having said stat buffs as their global passives i will be keeping an eye on leaks to see if that ends up being the case,NEGATIVE,0.9989622831344604,0

its nothing special yeah about that i thought about this for a while and ive come to the conclusion that hoyo can use this g passive to justify implementing more enemies that can shot you that might not sound bad at first but remember not everyone has enough money to guarantee a star thats a possible pulls after all so not having castorice means you wont be able to complete moc from here out not until you get a character that can bypass bs shot kill mechanics which theyre already implementing with the new dead dragon boss i might add and this is going to be the new route hoyo can take going forward need to make the game harder without increasing hp just create more global passives and reasons why you need them drop the copium,NEGATIVE,0.9976956248283386,0

no this is about revenue and not at all about lore the devs are definitely thinking if hi can get away with it then why not hsr unfortunately cn doesnt seem to mind the way that global does and therefore i see them pushing this further in the future the game has honestly been on a nose dive trajectory for a while now and if they dont make an effort to turn it around soon i might just quit ive already decided im going fp because of the castorice situation not that theyll miss my per month but hopefully there are enough quitters and sudden fps to make them notice,NEGATIVE,0.9923296570777893,0
see gacha smack already talked about this brother its not a matter of oh its just a revive and itll leave you on hp so its not that strong its a matter of if you accept and allow them to push this bull through next time it can be something actually more game breaking for example we could be getting implant sametype weakness on all enemies when one enemy has a weakness implanted followup attacks deal x more damage when allies consume hp with their skills consume xx flat amount of hp once more when skill points are consumed increase damage dealt by x or something like increase crit rate by as global passives power creep will get even worse than it already is which is saying a lot,NEGATIVE,0.9988716244697571,0
im with you on this one ill wait for the real reason to quit this game i mean people complained during acherons banner that it could have a bad precedent but even at x shes still the only one with a mob killing skill if they ever introduce a gamebreaking global passive that would ruin the game for me then yeah ill easily drop this game but for now im still enjoying the game,POSITIVE,0.9602419137954712,1
my main reason for not liking global passive is the fact that it feels like an insult to previous emanators like there is no lore reason why those shouldnt get a global passive if castorice is getting one it feels super especially since the lack of lore reason allows hoyo to spam global passive if they so wish which sucks for emanators it is very likely that well get them based on paths without emanators currently since they heavily really on same path characters right so thats one level of safety combine this with the fact that they are the most gifted people in the entire universe second only to aeon like theyll be rare for sure and no one would question why an emanator is so game breaking cus they always are anyways tbh there isnt even that big of a reason to release herta on apart from the fact that she needs to be there before tribbie and anaxa idk couldnt they have changed thigs up ill be more accepting if it makes sense why a character is op and not just oh we like this waifu and we want to push her to be the center of attention i like castorices design but the way they did her kit makes it feel like they want to desperately shove her into peoples face without any based reason like blade also has a part of an abundance emanator you definitely gonna give him castorices global passive when buffing him right dev anyways nice vid sorry for being a hoyo hater,NEGATIVE,0.9965040683746338,0

the reason why global passive is so problematic is that it requires no skill in this supposed strategy game and hsr is already very limited in strategy it will become a collect and buy game removes all sense of strategy and make the game unbalanced in the long run the game will just become strictly a character check game global passives are also flexible enough so the devs can break any rules they want to fit their predatory marketing,NEGATIVE,0.9991254210472107,0

in noway this isnt a test yes people are pulling cas regardless but it also signifies that its ok to add more global passives in the future because unlike beta testers or people who read leaks the ones that dont which are most of the playerbase dont really care about the games balance most of them dont even play endgame oh you clearly dont how hoyo works just like genshin their games are always at its best in the first years while slowly pushing the boundary along the way and the moment they realize that players are hooked and wont stop playing no matter what god forbid whatever scummy moves theyll throw at us to push the revenue id say the critisism is justified its not that theyre worried of something that hasnt happended yet that something has already happended a mediocre global passive is still a global passive regardless i played this game since and already spent a bit saw how seriously they were willing to take feedback and thought this time itll be different thisll be better than how they treat their genshin players guess in the end its still a hoyos game afterall and i dont think zz will be any different in a year,NEGATIVE,0.9917816519737244,0
maybe the reall issue is that no one wants to quit everyone is too far deep so they want the game to get better but when things like this happen they cant just leave and return they take it out on community members my two cents is to remember you wont waste your money if you decide to stop and as a fp you havent wasted your time gacha games are just games leave and come back when you want too or never you arent going to die if you miss out,NEGATIVE,0.9702665209770203,0

soullessky i dont think you get what im saying im saying the leaks make no sense because one of the passives would brick your account its an incentive to not pull the unit and not spend money since again a spd buff would brick your intentionally slow units and spd tuning if you pulled the unit on accident your account would be bricked so you cant even build pity if you otherwise wanted to pull the unit due to designmeta etc you cant anymore since again the spd passive would brick your account all im saying is that these leaks are obvious fake because hoyo wants to make money not lose it hoyo is known to be greedy why would they brick your account if you decided to spend money to pull,NEGATIVE,0.9996077418327332,0

its not about castorice global passive alot of people already said its was not that op the problem is its open a pandora box that can and will slippery slop did you really think hoyo who cant manage powercreep and hp inflation can manage global passive oh look there a new char that will not sell well what we have to do lets add global passive so that people will be pressured to pull it always start wit small thing like this,NEGATIVE,0.9996464252471924,0

the issue about presedent isnt really that they can do it obivously they can do anything its that it shows how they are now willing to do it really the only way this could have possibly went down well is if they assured that global passives would only be small gimmicky things like this and saved for special occasions does seem like my choice to competlely skip hsr has been repeatedly vindicated over the years though i do hope they dont remain the only hoyo game to buff old units and move old limiteds to standard,NEGATIVE,0.9987658262252808,0
i largely agree with your points in the vid definitely not a fan of the whole global passive concept unless its something benign like how in genshin some characters mark items on the minimap or reduce currency costs when leveling weapons in the grand scheme though i dont think her revive will have a significant impact on combatfocused content so i hope nobody feels pressuredforced to pull her but hopefully this is just a oneoff since castorice is the big anniversary character thats been hyped up since her debut and so the devs just wanted to give her the extra special treatment,NEGATIVE,0.9865763187408447,0
okey so i think it depends mainly whether endgame is going to be balanced around it or not if it becomes hard to the point its a necessity to have these passives then yeah trash addition but if its balanced as usual then i think it could be okay because of reasons like giving a nudge to teams using older characters to keep up as well as being a powercreep countermeasure imagine if in the future castorice becomes super powercreeped she would still have her usefulness because of this revive even if you dont use her these are the kind of things that could happen if they dont balance endgame around these passives the other extreme would be that if they release too many passives and still dont balance endgame around it players could snowball through endgame making it a breeze depending on how game changing they are all in all it would be better if they didnt add them but if they do they should be few and far in between,NEGATIVE,0.998016357421875,0

i think something should be said about blowing it out of proportion not to disagree with that notion as it is easily the hottest topic out of the upcoming patch with many opinions but there are a lot of reasons as to why its exploded to this degree a considerable part of the community or at least a very vocal part of it is unhappy with the games current direction in various places namely toward feelings of powercreep lack of events or content etc the passive was the icing on the cake and i guarantee it wouldnt have garnered this level of disdain if the other aspects of the game were meeting player satisfaction expectations concerning the video i do agree with the notion that its very much being exploded about people are quitting and stuff over it but the passive is better considered to be a death knell for the commitment of those players assisted with a buildup of the aforementioned unsatisfactory game factors the thing is this passive never had to be globally applicable neither did it need a persistent ui to let you know its active i would argue that yes the passive was thematically and artistically inspired but corporately tampered with the negative press generated by this passive and its severity i would say is just to press an extreme reaction so that hoyoverse would never go as far as to consider more drastic applications to that end if people are genuinely and severely outraging over it then yeah its not worth all of that just leave the game behind however in my eyes theres nothing wrong with an extreme reaction towards a company that makes games with some of the most severe monetary strategies as a core mechanic i mean you can see it in the events itself theres an entire whaling event with that i think its much easier to assume that the passive was more corporately tampered with to this degree rather than the passive just being something cool finally while its true they couldve broken the games balance instantly with an insane passive thats just something they wouldnt do for now theres a reason why the footinthedoor argument is thrown around a lot concerning the passive many would rather have the door shut right now with as much heated discourse as it takes to prevent its potential future prominence in gameplay,NEGATIVE,0.9986820816993713,0
you dont get it the problem isnt cast iron rices revive itself which is absolutely not a small thing at all since it procs for each party member its the fact that if she sells well which she definitely will because most hoyo players are brain dead gambling addicts who only care about seeing numbers go up then it means that we will get more global passives and you know for a fact that they will add some really broken ones,NEGATIVE,0.9955118298530579,0

re no persistent threat of allies dying i argue it opens up room for more enemy damage powercreep and oneshots akin to highconundrum sudu since they can expect most people will have this free revive again speculation but it is a risk re thematiccoolness gameplay mydeis autoplay doesnt even make thematicstory sense jfc i hate this argument with mydei in particular his story is about agency and learning that he can make his own choices no matter what anyone says so long as hes willing to take the consequences of his own choices removing player agency takes away from this why are we able to play w other characters that have high agency or high political power but not him therta acheron and argenti answer to nobody the trailblaze is literally entirely about paving your own path like mydei boothill is notoriously rebellious mydeis autoplay makes no sense thematically at least feixiaos arguably does but it gives you a greater sense of control on top of being cool instead of taking it away even if its a false sense its not equivalent to we tf they did to mydei i argue that anyone who insists the autoplay was for lore reasons doesnt understand or didnt pay attention to mydeis story lastly they literally couldve just made it a normal passive instead of a global one its been established in story that her curse is proximitybased so why should it work when shes off the team this is our first revive passive on an e limited character which is already quite special even more so cause shes a dps it wont be the end cause casuals wont care and some will pull for other reasons bc this particular passive isnt that bad tbf in a vacuum it is fine i love castorices character and the amphoreus story enough to stay and pull a little but hoyo has lost a lot of my trust and probably a lot of others too the fact that they apparently ignored such negative feedback for both cas and mydei and kept these mechanics indicates that they will not be so receptive to playertester feedback in this department moving forward they can always do whatever they want youre right about that but if they want to keep good reviews and a strong playerbase they need to maintain goodwill with the players and this isnt how they do it keep it up and more will leave or make their dissatisfaction heard,NEGATIVE,0.9875993728637695,0
ill agree with what youve present those are good points but i still have some issues with what these global passives might represent something they could do and probably wont is give these passives to more than one character if not all of them including the ones that already exist i saw global passives working on games where we get all character just by farming the game and they give a small amount of base and special stats good enough to have but still not game changer,NEGATIVE,0.910248875617981,0
my take is that as long as they keep to golbal passive active only its not that big a deal id much prefer them to do fp alternatives like some kind of gadget and just reuse the ui elements from the scepters things in su but if you can global passive buff stack im leaving,NEGATIVE,0.9996540546417236,0
i am really ready to quit this game i cant stand the idea that castorice is the test subject for hoyo to add global passive to the game like we asked buffs for old characters we like to play not this thing the worst part is casual player who doesnt engage or not have enough knowledge about the implications of castorices future impact on the game is saddening for me i am really tired of this game i was originally going to quit after getting phainon but i dont know i just feel defeated for some reason i like this game but i dont think devs respect me as playercustomer,NEGATIVE,0.9996932744979858,0
hoyo has technically played with global passives before in genshin but they were limited to just resources if you owned certain characters then forging certain weapons or enhancing certain weapons would cost less money but they didnt directly influence combat in any way a passive that influences combat when a character isnt in the team feel weird though if they make more passives like this i feel that they should add a selector on which one is active in order to prevent character stacking powercreep,NEGATIVE,0.9982947707176208,0
heres the thing like this particular buff is nothing but its literally pandoras box people have been complaining abt it since beta and they refuse to do anything abt it if they dont get enough backlash then they will continue to make more characters with a global passive and they will very very likely stack and not be as useless as castorices they set a precedent people have been saying this for a reason goddamit this video is incredibly shortsighted,NEGATIVE,0.9993966817855835,0

the way i see it its about parity and equity global passive breaks a fundamental rule of the game only active characters can affect battle the more they break their own rules the more disenfranchised players will get baked in weakness implants like firefly and boothill was already a major rule breaking moment we didnt need another one already on just the nd anniversary,NEGATIVE,0.9977746605873108,0

of course you shortsighted people might not see this as a major issue a global passive system is fine if its obtainable solely through ingame currency not by swiping your card people may not recognize the problem immediately because its a longterm concern knowing how hoyo operates they definitely wont stop here with castorice its your choice whether to continue supporting the game or not but choose wisely you might end up wasting your time and money on a game that could be dead in the near future,NEGATIVE,0.9995354413986206,0

dawg i think you just described yan qing the undisputed title holder for the worst star in the game,NEGATIVE,0.9997410178184509,0
i think the way they designed break it pretty much had to be done for the break damage dealers to work these also dont reduce the enemies resistance to the element but even then you could argue thats just bad game design and id be inclined to agree the ones i do find problematic are silver wolf acheron and feixiao silver wolf isnt a big problem now because of her kits inherent issues but acheron has no business dealing colourless toughness damage while also having res pen and the same can be said about feixiaos toughness damage and also what the hell is the point of anaxa being able to implant every single weakness to all enemies at once they dont even lose the resistances and its not a gimmic to enable an archetype im completely baffled,NEGATIVE,0.99903404712677,0
crashsparrow yup pretty much agree acheron reducing toughness through toughness protection status is probably the worst offender i disagree that it was necessary for break though without fire implant firefly wouldve been great dps for only fire enemies which was part of the original balancing reason for elements to begin with but they wanted to make her universally good and i say this criticism as someone with an e firefly lol,NEGATIVE,0.9969949722290039,0
xanavii i disagree if firefly is only good for fire enemies that will limit her too much you might as well just pull a crit unit or any damage type,NEGATIVE,0.9991569519042969,0
xanavii i dont think that firefly would be ok without colourless toughness break problem with break carries is that they dont do any dmg if the enemy isnt broken crit carry will deal less dmg but not by that much unless you are trying to kill an enemy with res against your carrys element,NEGATIVE,0.9725658297538757,0
blueknight i think this limitation would be better for the game but hoyo just enabled this perspective after and because of acheron the lack of respect to their own type system is what makes firefly more appealing by having fire implant while also making balance worse hoyo is saying instead of pulling for a specific damage types just pull those characters who can do anything which makes elemental system obsolete and im not even talking about damage powercreep its a powercreep of systems,NEGATIVE,0.983540952205658,0

i guarantee that if firefly or boothill couldnt do weakness implant people would have been screaming about how hoyo was being vewwy vewwy mean and punishing players who didnt pull silver wolf i mean they did the same screaming when aglaea dropped and it turned out that really letting her off the chain more or less required sunday im not here to defend global passives but comparing it to the super break team design is a bit spurious,NEGATIVE,0.9994507431983948,0

not to be rude but i dont think you realise the full effect this could have if this is successful which it most likely will be they will definitely keep pushing it towards global dmg crit spd buffs etc and then other gacha games will see its success and copy it me personally im sticking until the fate collab and if the global passives are starting tohave become a real problem i will drop hsr,NEGATIVE,0.9950443506240845,0

it would actually suck balls if sticking a global passive on a hero is hoyos idea of making them more meta viablestronger i dont think it even should be in a tryhard grindy game like this at all no matter how strong or weak it is like they got the idea that they can do this and that in itself is scary because there is no telling what future characters will do i think that fear of what can be done is one of the main forces nothing could happen but the thought of something happening is not a pleasant one,NEGATIVE,0.9996882677078247,0
i am personally not too bothered by this situation and you sum up my feelings quite well i play a game because i enjoy it and if enough internal or external factors change that perspective i move on the relative power of characters or the difficulty of the end game content have never been issues for me even before i could moc it was only jade i lost out on i get the feeling some people just care way too much about their relative performance in the game you arent really competing against anyone that said if this is what debacle is what makes you quit i dont blame you and fully support that decision,POSITIVE,0.9954800605773926,1
so funnily i think the controversy is a symptom of something else frustration at the general direction hsr is heading yknow at least with genshin theres the aurgument that its a game that caters to a casual audience but even it is experiencing a similar debate as even the casual elements are falling into typical gacha trappings hoyo games are just becoming more gacha aspects that they usual bunk are becoming more present yknow the benifits there adding for whales is just the black card or exclusives from other gacha buffs arent new to gacha but even the most significant buffs dont matter when powercreep out paces it i think the anger is that people have found themselves liking gacha games have an upfront fee in terms of time and money where gacha are burst of times spread out with the option to pay full games ask to hour upfront and to dollars if your somebody who enjoyed hsr whats the alternative and i mean in terms of polish so people are frustrated,NEGATIVE,0.9888142943382263,0

wish that passive didnt become global there was so much hate yet hoyo did nothing,NEGATIVE,0.9966251850128174,0
this problem is being taken so out of proportion people is talking like this pasive is goint to one shoot the bose that was killing your whole team already not just one character or like they werent going to pull ever again for a new character you can wait of one that you like the powercreep in the game is out of control but the problem is not here but in the ridiculous hp inflation we dont know if we are ever going to get another universal pasive anaxa doesnt have one but we know that hp keeps going up and that old units are getting buffed i dont know how things are going to end but there are far more relevant things to talk about that this,NEGATIVE,0.997075080871582,0
i absolutly do not care about any global passives or powercreep in hsr because in my eyes it is a game about lore and story with some gameplay attached to it for appearances i will play it as long as the story is good in games like genshin or zz such things would be inexcusable but it is a game you leave on auto for most of the playtime why would i care,NEGATIVE,0.9977129697799683,0
ok here is my hoyo shill take healing is just worse than shielding and with hp scaling characters they can no longer use max hp boosts in healers kits to make them more similar to shields they know everyone will get castorice because she is a popular character that they have been pushing they give her a global passive allowing you to revive if you have a way to heal in order to counterbalance shielding being stronger now how much you heal matters more because youre healing all the way from but they couldve done this differently still and id rather they didnt do this,NEGATIVE,0.998879611492157,0
these comments just do not understand that this very likely could be a one time unique thingif hoyo really wanted global passives on just any character they wouldve done it in genshin atp but it wouldnt make sense lore wise so they havent im like sure this is one time thing that we wont see again unless its on another anniversry character which again theyd have make it fit the lore of the character and not just slap it on even if it doesnt work with the story,NEGATIVE,0.9956327080726624,0
to be honest i dont think the whole playerbase would be outraged by this the real majority of the playerbase the real casuals who do not engage with the online community of hsr or any gacha in general will not care about this were in the smallest minority so i doubt the outrage for the global passive will amount to anything in the grand scheme of things but well see,NEGATIVE,0.9902719855308533,0

i am rather certain hoyo wouldnt push global stat buffs as a mechanic in future kits the simple reason being hsr devs arent stupid enough to kill the balance of a game over a very very marginal amount of extra money in the short term you might think well hsr devs dont care about balance at all to which i would say if they really didnt care about fundamental game balance why would they ever restrict sundays skill to only nonharmony units if they really didnt care about game balance they wouldve forgone all restrictions and let the game run wild with infinite energy exploits and infinite turn loops if the devs really want to push global passives how come neither anaxa hyacine nor cipher have been leaked with any in their kit that would surely make more money right the cold hard truth is the reason why reddit and twitter have been parroting this global stat buff paranoia is because none of them are businessmen actuaries or game developers who know how to maximise profit they think global stat buffs will make hoyo more money but if anything they will lose money in the long run how would they lose money global passives incentivise and create fomo its exactly because it creates fomo that they will lose money imagine five units come out with no global passives and then one comes out after with a passive would anyone really spend money on any of those five units if they know that another higher value unit with a global passive would be coming probably not if people collectively feel this fomo and stop pulling for a few patches most fp would have enough pulls to es the new unit anyway so hoyo wouldnt even be able to suck the low spenders dry,NEGATIVE,0.999457061290741,0

honestly you sum up my feelings on the matter really well it sucks but at this point in time we cant really do anything just be tentative with the whole idea of global passives and hope this doesnt turn out as bad as many expected and wont actually affect the enjoyment from the game for many people im still really excited for the next patch cause of all the changes coming in and i am pulling for anaxa im hesitant on castorice cause i love dragon and she has a cool dragon but thats kinda all i like about her other than her animations so idk if itd be worth pulling just for those two things when her kit and gameplay themselves dont really call to me,NEGATIVE,0.7375780344009399,0

tldr global passives are longterm effects that will enhance powercreep even more shorter text for those that dont want to read more this is testing the waters this is either them ignoring feedback for a mundane detail or deliberately trying out global passives global passives are a long term issue and will affect everyone who doesnt have every character the timeline of beta testing cas and anaxa to them adding global passive to one and buffing them while nerfing the more hyped one is another issue in itself vote with wallet is not effective because the community is literally playing a game about gambling for digital characters that will be worthless sooner or later powercreep still getting ignored for the majority while releasing global passives that will influence the decisions for endgame content suck most people who are criticizing it arent doing it because of the revive its the criticism of hoyo painstakingly testing the waters on global passive approval the issues at hand with powercreep not getting adressed in any way for most older units but instead introducing another thing that will be taken into consideration for new endgame fights and the worst part of it all is what will come next if the community isnt loud and clear about this we dont need nor want global passives in general but even moreso the ones that have stat manipulations like adding literal crit dmg like what apparently phainon gets tested on right now or similiar mechanics that is the isuse because this game already doesnt struggle with making characters indocue fomo upon us all this will make that fomo worse some people are also not happy about the blatant favoritism for cas in the upcoming patch character test leaks come out people are more hyped for anaxa buff cas people still want anaxa nerf anaxa people still want anaxa test global passives and nerf anaxa even more into the ground while buffing cas that entire timeline feels very scummy and that paired with the feeling of them ignoring powercreep while making a new mechanic which will guaranteed speed up the process is making people rightfully upset personally i will stop playing this game alltogehter once the characters actually release and cas having a global passive i dont want to support this predatory marketing either monetary wise which i did do in the past i am a shark level spender consistently or even number wise on their playercounts i find the discussions especially in the hoyolab very distgusting in how people try to defend the practices done them taking microsteps each patch pushing more fomo onto each character and each time people say but this isnt actually that bad while ignoring every criticism point points i disagree on yes they can buff the shit out of damage on enemies that will make a difference and that will happen either be it when the next shielding sustain comes into play or the near fututure thats literally testing the waters they will see how many people are already fine with having global passives that is literally testing the waters in every way possible and that is an issue no doubt people are not good at actual boycotts especially when it comes to the gaming scene i mean hell have you considered that gacha is literally gambling with no monetary return and instead characters that will become worse and worse every patch that is the issue with global passives this will never happen you will always be on the brink between this is kinda a must pull because of the passive vs ah its just a small thing it doesnt matter thats why the entire global passive thing is such an issue the players dont realize how much it will stack overtime and especially in years if they were to continue that way of releasing characters with the new mechanic more than twice a year global passives arent immediate issues they are becoming ones that will wreck the place very hard and yes the devs could just ruin the game at any moment and honestly the fact they got so much feedback against global passives is in no way enough but it for sure is an indicator that they are willing to either put the smallest detail above critcism of not just any part of the community but the literal beta playtesters or they are willing to introduce the mechanic despite the negative feedback,NEGATIVE,0.9996289014816284,0

jadetarem yes this isnt the first time a gacha game introduces a global passives mechanic the difference being that other gacha games make the global passives part of the base system so both fps and pws have equal standing grounds they dont lock the global passive behind a gacha character hird does have global passives as well in the form of divine keys which is still terrible but the main difference is that most of them have craftable alternatives released some time after the divine keys release hsr as we know so far is only releasing these global passives on limited characters the most egregious one being the fate collab characters because theyre only gonna be run once and probably will never be rerun ever again just like the eva collab in hird,NEGATIVE,0.9951445460319519,0

concerns are not what youre doing its plain doomposting youre not concerned about the future but afraid it will go bad and arguing in that direction by default i dont know how you dont realize it reading things yourself they listen to the playerbase but they dont have to do everything theyre told thats not how feedback works its the portion of the playerbase that cares about this being minuscule the amount of people who even open the endgame screen is minimal from those the people who know this is a nonissue and the ones who pay too much to care outweight the ones complaining even if they were all gone nothing would change and i hope they keep their word and leave because worrying over nothing every patch will only make them unhappy on top of getting farmed by creators stoking drama its the same thing every time something new gets released since a scandal about superbreak a scandal about full team advance a scandal about mydeis auto no one learns its exhauusting,NEGATIVE,0.9989915490150452,0
chdd the only part i agree with you is the middle paragraph tbf though personally i was not part of the superbreak scandal or mydei scandal since i genuinely think those are non issues hell i didnt even realise there was a scandal i ignore pretty much most drama in this community because i genuinely dont care about it though this is one issue that i find to be worth caring about were afraid because of our concern that the game is going to accelerate to a more predatory experience global passives means that even if you dont like a character you might want to pull for the buff itself it may not be an issue when it is minor buffs and at the start but becomes an issue when they keep releasing more and more characters with global passives and it stacks but yeah the options are to keep playing and hope they dont go overboard or just leave first,NEGATIVE,0.9938954710960388,0
at least we have some common ground to drive the point home all the things i mentioned were overblown just like this but not in the same scale and none of them matter its all drama this one youre not concerned about the buff just the feature but every single character has a risk of you disliking them but wanting something from their kit how many people skipped jiaoqiu despite having acheron skipped tribbie because shes a kid model people even skip characters for being men global passives are no different anaxa is coming out and his kit doesnt have a global passive in it from what ive seen from others they dont either its specific characters only in fact it would be beneficial for the people who cant clear the game currently to get some help from outside their team because theres nowhere else they can get help from when they enter a stage but people would rather freak out about it by default simply because they dont know how to respond to new information its no secret that people are resistant to change but with minimum scrutiny its easy to tell what is worth worrying about and what isnt,NEGATIVE,0.9984750151634216,0
chdd while i agree most people easily freak out over anything and are resistant to change that happens both against improvement and degeneration if people are resistant and it turns out its a change that would be bad its a moment where it makes sense to support while also reminding people to be more analytical first before reacting if they are resistant to something that would be beneficial is when you can call it out in force i used to have the same mindset as you so i understand where youre coming from with it your character kit examples are literally the characters kit where it requires you to have that character in the team not a passive that is global so its quite redundant in the situation regarding worth worrying people dont want the experience to get worse which is an understandable worry though the extent a smaller handful of people go overboard dunking in people who just pull castorice is annoying if its a game they actually like and with a company they know does not gaf abt them though it feels horrible it is sensible to just accept the situation and choose options such as leaving the game and see if the game experiencd becomes far worse play but not spend any more money in case the game experiencebecomes far worse and you lessen sunk cost or just dont gaf abt the games health anymore and have fun while it lasts,NEGATIVE,0.9958594441413879,0

ngl i havent played hsr since the end of belibog so i have no horse in this race and after watching so many hsr ccs cave or do a on castorice i now hope her banner breaks records simply because itll be a clear signal to hoyo to open the flood gates on global passives and i want to see just how insane the devs will get with them like in mos will there be half a dozen a dozen maybe even more global passives in the game and just how broken will future gps be imo in a vacuum castorices gp isnt that game breaking but what about one that gives every team cr or speed and if hoyo does go that far with powerful gps will content be balanced around those gps to the point where if you dont have most of the characters with gps will even midlevel content will be a struggle maybe if this was done by another company one that had a good track record when it comes to balancing monetization and fomo with being fp friendly and providing an overall good experience for all players id have more faith that gps wont get out of hand but this is hoyo who has pretty much the worst track record out of any of the bigger gacha companies my only fear is that if the gps are highly successful then other devs will borrow the idea but i tend to be way more picky about the gacha devs who games i play and the gachas i currently play all have devs who have proven they want to make video games first and keep the monetization reasonable so that theu make more than enough money but they also dont feel the need to squeeze their playerbases for every dime also i feel hoyo know that their core player base are mostly children with undeveloped fromtal lobes or lobotomized adults so they can do the most predatory things in their games and their players will still eat up all the slop hoyo tosses their way,NEGATIVE,0.9993709921836853,0

ramandeepsinghmlkg i understand your perspective bro i think its fine but you need to accept that pay win is a gradient the game is unequivocally becoming more paywin by introducing this since there is now stricly more spectrum to invest in before you were limited to full es team with perfect relics now the ceiling will keep growing with passives agreed right now its only slightly higher because who cares about the revive but the way forward is there they broke the the team is what is in combat rule youre right eidolons were already paywin but there is even more paywin now some people dont want the game to become even more paywin its as simple as that i dont think we disagree its just a displacement on the gradient if hoyo doubles the price for top up by your logic it doesnt change anything because it was already paywin but it would change the investment equation ok maybe bad example because it would only affect spenders but i hope you get the point,NEGATIVE,0.9914073348045349,0

i feel the drama is too exaggerated because people are mad because of future global passives when we dont even know if there will be another global passive character you shouldnt be mad at something that has yet to happen there is zero confirmation of future global passives like speed or crit damage or anything castorice global passive is balanced because people wouldnt even need it normally if your team is dying then your team isnt working anyways castorice passive tend to be only active regularly in her own team in other teams characters with aventurine or lingsha you wouldnt die anyways the drama will die down in a few months if hoyo just never releases another global passive and even if they do they would do things like stats boost outside party because it would break the game and wouldnt fit the lore,NEGATIVE,0.9994151592254639,0

its a simple tell really pushback this sort of bs so that current and future gacha games dont get reeled into doing the same predatory idea as much as the dumb part of the community that thinks hoyo started everything yeah hoyo innovated the bs hoyo innovated global passives imagine them introducing a char so powerful that because of lore he could break the th wall and for shats and giggles hoyo decides to add a feature into their kit that they could give you a skip button but the char is paywalled imagine that also with all the lore crap they give castorice shes death right so lore accurate we shouldnt be needing a revive anyways right we can just slap her in and since lore and all she can just kill everything right why do we need a revive if she could just kill everything hell i think even a chance of instant kill on anything sounds better than a global revive if by chance an upcoming game implements this paywalled global passive the gacha gaming community will only look at game that started all this bs its just a matter of time before they dip their fingers on zz,NEGATIVE,0.9985290765762329,0

box i admit i am hypocrite for pulling castorice even though i said i dislike the idea of global passive respect pokke hes taken it upon himself to hold back other ccs that want to talk shit and start drama with me causing him a lot of shit in the background and nothing of which im aware of while im thankful hes trying to divert these ccs from coming at me i dont see why it matters to any of us since we both know all these ccs are irrelevant their existence is meaningless to me let them chase their latest drama slop with my name none of them will come close to the influence that ive shared with tec since before i even quit my full time job if they want to farm some views because they need it im all for it heck they are already farming this as we speak because tec stopped holding them back yes this is referring to people like saintontas no i dont give a fuck about bro even if he made vids about me hope hes happy with the ad rev i will never engage there has been a lot of collateral damage on both parts and im glad that he acknowledged his actions have inadvertently caused me issues as do i the c arle is a poor example and i apologise i shouldve used c cantarella instead even though the point is exactly the same no one should be morally held for pulling a gacha unit you arent a hypocrite you are a player he believes in pro consumerism and the customer is always right but i dont he caters to anti hoyo i cater to people that happens to play hoyo games in this case hsr its just the way it is while i can see the differences in ideology doesnt make him my enemy most people on the internet wont see that especially people that have their own agendas to push viewers and ccs alike compared to being called a rapist or pedophile being called a hypocrite pales in comparison but it doesnt make it any less bad because those are his views of me and i would never have those views of him i still hold my ground against the people that have these moral compasses in a gacha game but its unfortunate that its against tec as well i mean this on my soul when i was rewatching the clips off stream during my time at austin and sdo with tec like meeting the first time going to gym hugging for the zz relic roll i got emotional not because we cant talk about each other anymore in order to appease both our communities and the ideological differences not because tec was one of my first and closest cc friend and i vibed w him hard but its because i know something like this will never happen again the next time if it ever happens his chat or my chat is probably gonna go kms ew dookie or kms ew dicktone as much as id love to hang out again we will never see the vibes being recreated unless our communities make a change there wont be a gacha war at least not between myself and tec its just a sad conclusion to a story one that no one couldve prevented as ourselves and our communities both stand for different things the best part instigators and drama ccs looking to farm this will spin the narrative into some even bigger bullshit to push their agendas and go ultra farm mode i know we wont interact on content anymore but this isnt content this is the end of an era from my pov tec you were never my enemy i never hated you as a person and never will and i wouldve moved to austin for a few months after i settled my house but this is the best ending for everyone in the space because most people online arent mature and cc farmers want to farm,NEGATIVE,0.9986690282821655,0

in a nutshell hoyoverse has a fkton of marketing in place so they can make fantastic use of losing alot of money presence in the gacha landscape to force ccs to not immediately just drop out but they just kept pushing it without a care in the world even when popular ccs started to leave which since they got a massive pile of games now they could probably give less then a entire fk if one of them collapses if they can just use that drama to promote another game and just continue the cycle to corpse circulate it and likely make far more money in one game to keep the other ones afloat with ease that even if all thar games are garbage as long as one of them is wildly successful they can keep the others running to just musicial chair which one to make the most popular and the others to just be fodder to promote ones other then themselves by being bad to make other ones look good kurogames actually understands regardless of what the stockholders demand if they dont appease the playerbase then they cant really make the money the stockholders would get back if they constantly flip off the playerbase much less keep the business running overall though stockholders is just a supplement to help with the games development not the mandatory driving factor on the game itself also why when i finally had to replace my honda accord finally after having it for nearly ish years i decided to pay in full for my next car immediately to not have to deal with any taxes or liabilities known as interest because thats what stockholders and catering to the market instead of the consumers always does the one who actually consume the media are the ones that should be your priority not the ones just using said media as some money laundering get rich with ease scheme by just humping a popular product and get more money outta it as it gets popular and the stockholder gets more greedier in the process,NEGATIVE,0.9983770847320557,0

xbladevanitas no not really i like penacony actually yes there are countless flaws eg moralism and forced moral high ground unnecessary dialogues in the main quest that makes it unnecessarily overstretched but the general diversity of characters the worldbuilding and its visual aesthetics philosophy and vibes were unmatched personally aventurine sunday and a part of acherons stories were my top favorites aventurine at top though some of smaller issues was acherons involvement in the whole plot and her unnecessary appearance most of the time same applies to the trailblazers since sunday had solid philosophical and metaphysical backing to validate him i wrote a k letter essay about that and sunday but ill keep it to later masked fools were nice especially sampo but the hanu adventures and sparkle side shenanigans were a bit unnecessary,NEGATIVE,0.9970370531082153,0
solariusaureum nah penacony was a mess if you actually follow everything thats happening in the plot firefly and robin get killed setting up a mystery gets side tracked by aventurines entire story till the end where oh gallagher is revealed as the one behind the deaths in penacony immediately throws all that away because death is the only way in the dream to reach the place gallagher wanted to show everyone because reasons that arent clear does this mean later on death stabbed boothill to get there for the really stupid monkey crap thats the absolute worst thing i have ever seen story wise sunday and the order just being the surprise villain at the end felt really rushed the pacing was all over the place and felt like hoyo couldnt focus on just one thing along with the fact that no one in penacony can just speak normally they all have to speak in the most drawn out cryptic nonsense not even gonna say anything about sparkle because she really didnt matter in the slightest,NEGATIVE,0.9997857213020325,0
xbladevanitas some of you said is true but the rest is just pure babble sunday order being the actual antagonists wasnt really a surprise if you actually followed up the buildup from earlier and the philosophy dialogue they were presenting but yeah to me acherons part vs aventurine and the ones in that range is what felt rushed and horrible to me though,NEGATIVE,0.9985939860343933,0

rickynguyen yeah im taking a break from playing it because of that despite it having my absolute favorite characters like elysia and kiana the mc but the lack of fp options for my characters pmo so bad i just stopped i never really deleted my account or anything i just stopped playing it this plus the story is ss after the mc kinda disappeared its a long story too literally xd im really sad that hsr is rather quickly descending down the path of its predecessor since at the beginning it had lots of hope and even during penacony i had a strong feeling that it could be a great game due to the hype it evoked in the community me included it was truly peak and then amphoreus happened and everything went downhill its sad and even more so seeing wuwa doing much better though the community there isnt my favorite to be entirely honest but this is just my take lol,NEGATIVE,0.999423623085022,0

i can understand and get behind the idea that you want the game to be better but at the same time i think youre looking at it wrong if your requirements for it to be better is essentially to be more complex and have all those mechanics you speak of other turnbased rpgs generally have it is not the design intent they are striving for to make the game as complex as those rpgs that should be quite clear does that mean the game cant improve no they can improve and do their interpretation of the genre better but i dont think the solution to that is by making it more complex,NEGATIVE,0.9987438321113586,0
you really think its impractical for most players not to engage with endgame endgame is mostly what you see content made around online but i really do think its true that most are just there for the story and some surface level engagement with the combat between the teenagers enamored with the world and characters more than the gameplay and older working adults that dont have the time or energy to sink into hardcore gameplay there are large demographics of people who are totally casual with the game heck my mother plays the game and she cannot stand combat focused content simulated universe is her worst nightmare theyre out there and in great number to them the little side quests collectables and hidden jokes are the content to go alongside the main story the minigame events are there for a reason good video by the way just thought that particular take was a bit silly,NEGATIVE,0.9621394276618958,0

pretty reasonable take especially like the item analogy it was on spot same thoughts about passive it aint something to worry about by itself it just can have a real bad consequences if the right things fall into wrong hands and yeah i am also feeling a bit down about state of the game too ive used to spend on the battle pass and monthly sub but now it is just sub and i am thinking about stopping that too weird feel because i like the characters and am still invested into some of em like i am currently hoarding all the currencies i manage to get into castorice fund no whaling though only daily drops and what you can get by playing buut i am just not feeling to spend time inside the game aside of daily activities feels bad man,NEGATIVE,0.9969673752784729,0

personally i felt cringe with feixiao being super saiyan in her ult but im not saying she is bad or horrible or whatever its my irrelevant opinion and also i came here to see what exactly is going on that makes everyone hate the game so much with castorice or global passive as im not sure what the problem is and to be fair i think im part of the minority that is completely fine with the game i have no issues with the story the only issue i have is the current protests which is somewhat understandable ai is trash but this is kind of being taken over the top a bit i dont really know much and it must be ignorant of me to not be as educated but currently people have gotten too comfortable in complaining about every small detail every patch people are complaining about it or are complaining about the same small thing like a list of who knows what for what knows who to be able to whatever the everwhat much easier im also just ranting my brain is scattered too so i may be more incoherent in what i typed and i apologize for that also sorry about the opinions i have but theyre my opinions nonetheless thank you for reading this,NEGATIVE,0.9959373474121094,0

just want to say the idea that fp dont matter something ive seen a lot including in comments is actually false they just matter in a different way for example during the genshin boycott though i was also upset by the situation and felt the disrespect i knew the majority of players were still going to spend andor play in fact it was encouraged to play but not spend because of server costsit was never worth getting into this with anyone but i saw legit one person ever mention it fp matter from a numbers perspective literally hey investors hey advertisers hey sponsors look at how many active players we have so technically fully quitting hurts a bit but not in the way most people think it does it doesnt hit their bottom line because at the end of the day any company offering free games technically has to be able to sustain the game as if no players are spending,NEGATIVE,0.997490406036377,0
the problem with hsr is its only premeditated ive said this for a long ass time and the pushback i got was all jrpgs are premeditated this is incorrect and if you think that youve not played enough good jrpgs hsr is about what team you have and what relics they have equipped after that you can just do a rotation and win vast majority of other jrpgs are about the tactics you use within the fight itself this is not to say some parts of jrpgs arent premeditated there is prep that you can do to make the fights easier but there is a healthy balance between strategy during the combat and premeditation before it hsr has very little strategy within the moment it attempts to offload that lack of depth in its boss designs but its already losing compared to a jrpg that breath and depth in character actions alongside bossenemy design ironically a huge problem with genshin impact is the premeditated nature of it beating abyss is about the team you build after that you just bash out your rotations,NEGATIVE,0.9976414442062378,0

i do think there are number of people that dont care about endgame maybe they play it maybe they dont but they def just care about enjoying the story i remember i was watching i creator and they were near the place were you do apoc and they said this mode is for tryhards and that blew my mind someone who has dedicated a relevant portion of their life to this game thinks that one of the few things to actually do and use your characters for us only for the highest percent of players not for ur average player so yes a there is meaningful amount of people that dont care about endgame who spend money on the game so why would hoyo care,POSITIVE,0.8789015412330627,1
i was a day player and i loved the game at the beginning hell the only reason i even gave it a try was because i sucked at turn based games and i thought hsr would help me learn how to play them better but by the time came out i didnt like direction it was going so i dropped it luckily i stopped playing it without spending too much money on it like i did when i was playing genshin,NEGATIVE,0.9945064187049866,0

honestly im at a point where i might be done with honkai star railnot because of the game itself the global passive or the socalled lack of content ive played all the content as an fp since day one and its fun most of the time and ive actually been more invested in zenless zone zero lately but whats really been pushing me away is the community its become so toxic and entitled at times i get itpeople want content that excites them and they take the game more seriously than others thats fair but some folks forget this game is going to be what the devs want it to be and its not going to be for everybody which is okay most players are just here for the story the characters and a chill experience i think theres a huge divide between casual and hardcore players and the hardcore side often comes off as loud and arrogantacting like their way to play is the only right way and everyone else is wrong that attitude is what kills the vibe if someones unhappy with the game quitting is totally valid but the constant negativity and aggression towards the game and community thats what makes it unbearable if i stop playing star rail its not because of the devsits because of the community,NEGATIVE,0.9985446929931641,0

um what seriously characters already do this but you need them in the team to work is the game impossible if you use a firefly team that doesnt have an e fu this is a gatcha game they add character mechanics that make the game easier in new characters as long as the existing characters can still beat the game even if a bit more difficult there really isnt a problem,NEGATIVE,0.7713744044303894,0

castorice is just another nail in the coffin that is hsrs death knell at this point so much missed opportunity lack of innovation lack of meaningful mechanics fan favorite characters are no longer viable or relevant in the story its fallen to an unfortunate cycle of catering almost exclusively to the repeat spenders a patch because the monthly stuff isnt nearly enough with the character throughput theyre going for and thats fine ultimately its the devs choice to make it so aggressive to replace old units i just dont vibe with the current trajectory or really any of the characters anymore,NEGATIVE,0.9996755123138428,0
regarding the argument around fp players actually matter one of the main reasons whales whale even if it isnt a conscious thing is for the bragging rights i have a better account than most people if there arent any fp players a big incentive for whales to spend money is gone this increases with online competitive games i believe there are some pvp gachas out there or gachas with leaderboards hird if there arent fp players those whales arent better than anyone why would they whale for a leaderboard where everybody whales to some degree this applies to single player gachas lets be honest at some point everyone of us bragged about how well build a character is or look i got lucky and got the character and the weapon or i got dupes of this character hope i made my argument clear tldr whales subconsciously or consciously whale to be better than the average fp player not having fp players in the ecosystem means whaling is even more pointless than it already is because they aint better than anyone this increases with multiplayer gachas or gachas with leaderboards,NEGATIVE,0.9996316432952881,0
the way i spend around these gacha games has been maybe i get the daily pass the battlepasses and then the first time top ups to guarantee a character or two and thats based on how i felt playing the game for the previous year i pull waifu over meta most of the time it just so happens the waifus i pull plus aventurine are meta or will be much like the cases of jade and topaz there are some sacrifices that need to be made like i cant pull every waifu so my account lacks characters like robin and lingsha hard choices have to be made and some endgame cycles are more painful than others so yes im pulling castorice,NEGATIVE,0.9986470341682434,0
ive been annoyed with the game for a while now i never pulled for acheron aventurine was a far more important grab for me i didnt pull yunli as i hate her character and her entire introduction made her seem like a disrespectful brat and then i didnt pull feixiao lingsha or fugue because i wanted other characters and i was punished for it with how powerful mobs were growing i have no powerful wind dps for instance apart from black swan they dont encourage variety anymore like they did before i usually am annoyed doing su or du they can be fun but theyre tedious to go through just to have save files to begin farming for planars a whole other hunk of nonsense to do before you can farm necessary things looking back there were moments in penacony where the story felt painful which is how felt i was so burnout from it that i didnt explore once after the story then the one character i wanted from amphoreus is just an autobattler and the global passive was the final straw if youre reading this please know there are three more at least coming i dont care what your cope argument is this should not be defended whatsoever they will be building this game around assumptions of everyone having these gp characters the others buff attack and skill levels you cannot defend this if you have a working brain for any form of forethought i uninstalled after grabbing mydei and will never look back,NEGATIVE,0.9994471669197083,0

i never understood this comment about most players not doing endgame as if they didnt need to do it to get currency to pull characters these people think they give enough pulls on events and exploration most exploration gives pulls at best each individual map with annoying puzzles and su gives tons of pulls but it takes so long to do it that unless youre willing to spend hours farming that youll never have enough pulls to get any character this patch literally had events big events and one of these you can finish in hours and the other is just another su revamp,NEGATIVE,0.9987911581993103,0

i agree with iyo point of view on the global passive its not castorices passive the problem the problem is in the future and a thing that nakes me mad is how they explained the global passive in the live they said since castorice is close to death she wants to delay its arrival what the fuck kind of logic is that if youre close to something you dont want to delay and i also agree that there are a lot of other problems with the game that i would like to see resolved for example the powercreep is there and we know so i would like to see either more rewards or the hp inflation needs to slow down this is a turnbased game you cant use skills like in another games to supply to the powercreep zz also as hp inflation and its worse than hsrs on the timeline but you dont feel it that much because you can use your skills to compensate,NEGATIVE,0.9912857413291931,0
i think a better analogy for the golden ball is instead of crack and mcdonalds i would actually say you gave me to pay rent for but now its and i need another a free ruan mei is nice if you dont need it you can just save the ball and use it on another character when they eventually become available in the rotation but if they dont give us a reliable way to get this item free x character isnt going to cut it especially ruan mei that is universal true but much more geared towards break teams and guess what archetype hasnt gotten much attention other than dot since x began other than that yes the value of the item might be youre essencially getting a limited character but the characters that are going to be in the shop rotation arent going to be worth the same as new characters i think this is their way to still be able to sell older characters that most people will not waste pulls on a rerun again ruan mei and other harmony characters are the exception but right now x characters are starting to go on rotation we probably wont see x characters on rotation until the end of x or the beginning of x so those characters will most likely given how things have been developong depriciate a lot in value other than the harmony characters robin sunday etc i dont see many x characters being worth pulling for when you have the x hunt dps doing twice as much damage as feixiao and mind you feixiao is still pretty good its just that since she released no other single target character has and characters that are aoe such as therta reach damage numbers equal if not higher than the single target dps so what will happen when another single target releases yup feixiao will be eclipsed the golden ball is a good start if they give us every patch you can either slowly build teams or you could save them and go all in on a character you like when they go on rotation and e them although i doubt that will be possible they will probably put a limit of characters or something that you can get through this shop if they give us silver ball per patch its less good but its the same deal you can slowly build a team of you can play the long game its just that this time itll take twice as long in a game that is constantly shifting with every single patch for the golden ball to be worth anything it needs to be a resource like variable dice rare but you can get one per patch if you buy the nameless honor or one every other patch if you dont buy nameless honor do i like that model no i think it should be per patch regardless if you spend or not but this is hoyo out of all greedy options this is the one that benefits most players especially since nameless honor has been getting more and more value with the introduction of the dice and the new resin,NEGATIVE,0.5983967185020447,0

there is no harsh reality the game has had aggressive power creep for a long time now to the point you need new characters to some extent usually supports to clear the content but no one is truly a must pull not having some characters make your account worse but does not make the game unclearable unless you skip all supports the global passive idea could lead to the first true must pull characters that is a reason to quit compared to before this company gets no benefit of the doubt we have every reason to believe they will double down hard on this i agree with the title tho this is the great filtering the only people that will continue to play are those willing to deal with the bullshit and burn their wallets and when they find out just how many people they have wrapped around their fingers this will likely leak into the other games,NEGATIVE,0.9979960918426514,0

i disagree somewhat with iyos take on the end game i play it to get jades but i only play it until i cant clear on my first attempt its not worth my time to get sweaty over those last few stars i think that most people are probably the same they only play the endgame casually which means that for them moc as and pf are just like another form of event mini game not an important part of the game just a way to get a few more jades from that perspective the endgame being of the game is a wild exaggeration because you hardly need to spend any time on it to get most of the rewards that are on offer,NEGATIVE,0.999133288860321,0
a cherry on top to what the game already being bad or like the final straw personally the global passive isnt what would break my camels back its so insignificant in the grand scheme of the game itself that it doesnt matter if its there or not but this is why i expressed my issues with hsr are not the same as everyone elses people feel differently about this thing thats their prerogative,NEGATIVE,0.9995513558387756,0

your first point isnt true because the global pass proves the game will never improve before now people held out hope the game would improve with this going through its essentially the nail in the coffin and you know other games will follow their lead remember when they said they would buff units for back in now months later saying to wait more months with no info on the buffs and its only for characters the powercreep hasnt changed they just increased hp again in the leaks sometimes you just gotta cut your losses youre yelling at a wall didnt genshin apologize for zhongli before buffing him,NEGATIVE,0.9983761310577393,0

my prediction is that global passives are a way for them to make new char more enticing as hoyo is self aware that their story or marketing is not good enough for people to pull with just that and they are also buffing previous so to make a distinction between new and old i want to add that if you are playing hsr for endgame then just quit the game its better for you,NEGATIVE,0.9994445443153381,0

i was a whale like i used to spend per patch but recently the story got way worse boring bloated dialog the hp inflation and powercreep i was already tired and exhausted trying to login and play this global passive was just too much with all the other issues that needed fixing i tried giving them time to improve and fix things but i had to stop lying to myself and living in a dream hoyo has no intention of improving hsr or making changes that i actually care about so anyway im cutting ties with hsr unsubbed from their youtube and twitter i have to move on,NEGATIVE,0.9995924830436707,0

going to be real while i agree with just about everything in the vid i think people should realize that kuro games is the exception when it comes to just about of gacha companies because you have this set of people that are jaded and realize this isnt something that can really be changed because to change it would mean to change how pretty much all gacha operate as in a complete overhaul hoyo is actually not only the standard as far as incentives in gacha but the model is actually rather tame compared to most gacha before genshincovid days and so a majority of those people that have played gacha before genshin will not even see global passives as a real issue and are at least smart enough to wait till it becomes an actual issue and besides the game is still enjoyable to them before the update like you said ppl were just going into the livestream when they were alrdy set on quitting and wanted an excuse,NEGATIVE,0.9465664029121399,0
its insane how many hoyo bootlickers exist in the comments or on discords and other groups people arent even willing to entertain the slippery slope this opens up not just for hoyo games but every other gatcha game out there run to wuwa but if hoyo doesnt get any push back kuro is gonna do the same shit ive never been quite as disappointed in a subgroup of gamers than the hsr community,NEGATIVE,0.997018575668335,0

an issue is they could absolutely make it matter which is what people are dreading if hoyo assumes a lot of players pull castorice they logically will want the players to see that value right ok time to jack up the damage of enemies and nuke you think they wont they jacked hp like crazy for a long time now that is what people are suspecting or dreading and there is no shot they release globals on stars that are meh or worthless but time will tell we gotta wait and see im just not holding my breathe because well its hoyo the star rail team has done some great things yes but unless these people are absolute generous saints i think many peoples suspicions will soon come to fruition,NEGATIVE,0.9975453019142151,0

sittingcrowd they only using black screens when its necessary more still images is actually fine than black screens they were using horrorlike storytelling during that tribbie nightmare scene the camera angles and characters expressions improved the comedy and chemistry between phainon and mydei is not forced and felt more natural than more action packed cutscenes less puzzles during story and characters stories into a story is actually fine as long as it still relevant to the lore like with understanding mydei we can see with succeeding nikadors coreflame means he must also succeeding his role as vanguard of amphoreus against the black tide for eternity for tribbie we know that even if she know that she would scattered into a thosand pieces and died eventually she is still doing so for the sake of amphoreus future it also noting that they only promised to do improvement of the story in but they really fixed the storytelling in advance,POSITIVE,0.9140449166297913,1
i guess its just a difference in opinions then because theres still a lack of things that the story telling desperately needs and we just didnt get any of that in we still have characters standing around and talking with no expressions on their faces spamming the same poses over and over the dialogue bloat is still one of the biggest issues as they like to make a simple plot unnecessary convoluted just to give the narrative a deeper meaning and the trailblazers still have done nothing in the story while we keep getting force shipped with the new main waifu in the region but maybe most of this will be solved in hopefully,NEGATIVE,0.9982853531837463,0
sittingcrowd no they dont forced the ship between cas and trailblazer unlike firefly castorice is only happy to see trailblazer seemed fine when they touch her during flame reaver first encounter because anyone that touch her will surely die instead of romantic chemistry its more like friendship between them and it felt more natural might develop into something more but lets see,POSITIVE,0.9969684481620789,1
shes looking like a firefly especially if you see leaks both drain their hp both want to be a normal girl both are cursed in a sense that they cant always interact with people both created major controversy within the community both have a close relationship with trailblazer and use them in their bis team both have insectsbug motifs firefly and butterfly both have deadly abilities but come across as sweet and innocent both are used by people for their incredibly abilities etc i could go on but its hard not to see her as just another firefly they definitely are setting her up to be the new girlfriend that everyone simps for,NEGATIVE,0.9308300614356995,0

it could have been such an easy fix to just tell the player base we read your feedback and changed the global passive talent for casotrice instead she will revive characters maybe multiple since bailu already revives one character herself while on the same team as said characters or hell just get rid of it being a global thing and change the talents effect to something else then so its not copying bailu they have seen the huge divide from this and of course they dont give a fuck once this harmless passive is passed it opens the expectation of future passives being released that will only become worse with time,NEGATIVE,0.9991806149482727,0

kenpicaro i didnt want to make fun of you dont get that wrong but i feel like people in the gacha community are kinda out of touch what a reasonable amount of money is too spend on a game most of people that call themselves gamers and play a lot of games for years probably did not spend k dollars on all their games in total consider what amount of money a company like larian studios got before they developed divinity and baldurs gate and those games are so much better and complex with the money people spend on gacha it should be easy for hoyo to add a skip button add more game modes add more cut scenes and so on although i think its fine people spending money on a game since its their hobby just compare what you can get with that money some years ago i traveled the world with euros with destinations with the likes of japan australia united states etc i didnot live in luxury hotel obviously but it was life changing adventure i will look still look back at it years if it comes too me and i myself also spend more than enough money on games everything above dollars is already pretty much,NEGATIVE,0.9519805312156677,0

not a fp but gonna defend them a bit here a fp players is a pw player waiting to happen gacha games are predatory because they try every trick in the book to get the conversion from fp to pw oh the content is time consuming well you can pay to finish faster oh you want both characters this patch well if you pay you can get them ah you lost the well pay more the whole fp dont matter to a company is not completely true fp players being able to clear all content is good advertisement for new players to come in the new players get hit by fomo or time wasting and potentially become whales if you spend once youre likely to spend again and especially hoyo is going above and beyond to get you to spend once yes a whale brings in the revenue but that is not the whole picture also free characters are great but getting a character that everybody told you to get and has a power crept bis team is not great the other character is one that is power crept and everybody told you to skip feels really bad,NEGATIVE,0.9989138841629028,0

i think ive been slowly falling out of love with the game since penacony and its primarily because of the storytelling and a lot of other stuff ive not been struggling much with endgame content but i will say at least with moc that it did feel a bit more difficult to get the clears i was looking for than it did before didnt care much for amphoreus at least at the start but i felt like the storytelling with this most recent update was improving again and while the global passive isnt exactly the nail in the coffin for me it sucks that it feels like they improve in way and then announce how they plan to fuck up harder somewhere else in the future and it feels like its all happening so fast,POSITIVE,0.9139271378517151,1

i have exemples in genshin impact the buffs to one of the shielders that was weak on release neuvillette bug fix they apologize and gave gem if i remember correctly i do agree on somethings with you about the passive the question is indeed why why the passive is global why are you doing this why now etc about the fp vs pw companies in general will turn to those who benefits them fp dont matter cause they are players yes but not those who make the companys benefice i dont mean it like fp are shit just trying to be as factual as possible personnaly i dont care about the passive in itself the thing is indeed it could lead to something disastrous as it could lead to nothing or something else i am in a state of wait and see i think its too early to put a hard verdict right now maybe i am coping and what i say will age like milk maybe not and time will tell if i was right or wrong either way they wanted this passive to be implemented it is submit or die mydei is that you for now im happy with the game i still have my fun i still like the story i like the endgame want more but i like it the way it is i like it however something important i want to say dont play a game you dont find fun in there is thousands of other games for you to enjoy waiting for you to play them,NEGATIVE,0.9804007411003113,0

the problem with how this issue is being addressed in twofold both on the company and the community on one hand the company is pushing out the global passive attached to pulling castorice rather than gaining it by completing her story which would make far more sense in lore and gameplaywise which is a scummy move on their part however the reaction from the community is vastly overblown and instead of just protesting by using their voices and their wallets the players who are protesting are also villainizing a vast number of other players who dont have a problem with it and want to pull castorice and play the game for their own personal enjoyment the issue is coming in where even as someone who doesnt like the implementation of the global passive ive completely switched sides to not caring anymore because the loudest voices that are calling for its removal are also claiming some insane moral highground over a gacha game an innately predatory genre built on the foundation of spending money for power if you want to protest predatory business practices then i have news for you quit gacha games altogether everyone who is standing on their high horse and calling out the global passive but still playing other gacha games is by definition a hypocrite because every gacha game is designed to entice you to spend money in the same capacity dont throw stones from glass houses it makes you look like a moron worst of all hsr is a single player game where you can get of the rewards in the endgame modes just by having two brain cells to rub together and spending the free currency you get and that isnt even the bulk of the currency youll earn the majority of the currency earned in the game is just by playing free to play those last stars in moc are only worth gems and it would literally take you a year and a half to garner enough gems from clearing or to get to even a single pity thats how little it truly matters theres no pvp and absolutely no content in the game that would pit your teams against someone elses so having global passives or not will not make you account worse in comparison unless you are comparing it yourself which isnt an issue the game is creating its an issue you are creating for yourself listen global passive or not its a goddamn game that people are playing for fun if you arent having fun for the love of god just take a break from the game or quit altogether dont make it everyone elses problem especially people who are still having fun with the game and do not act like youre somehow morally superior for having done so if youre jumping ship to play another goddamn gacha game,NEGATIVE,0.9995504021644592,0

i have not heard anyone else talk about it but pulling castorice incentives you to not actually build or use the unit at all which is stupid if you run castorice in your main team you get to have a man squad if you run a team with out her now you get a man squad technically since you now have a extra passive revived it seems like to get a maximum value from the unit you just dont want to even run them because i get to run a entire extra unit now such a stupid unit to add to the game also them giving you free supports is great and all for new players and getting a castorice when you start the game is also cool but now if you decide to get into the game after this patch you will be at a infinitely worse starting point then anyone else why would you even start playing at that point,NEGATIVE,0.9976754784584045,0

i disagree with the position that castorice is the end i just started a new account and its a fact that the difference of an accounts strength if it has therta and doesnt have it is major same with robin ruan mei tribbie or any other ss tier character the accounts strength completely changes with single character the not havers are already being beat down by the power creep and castorice itself isnt anything different than just a ss tier character with some additional functions for comparison i also had an old eu account with old s tier characters and that account is a complete joke even though it has numerous former s tier characters which are now trash and struggle with clearing penaconys normal enemies unless i run a dedicated heal tank my new account is in asia and that account has a yunli tribbie gallagher with himekoherta and i smashed through everything with that account if you already have therta or can shot content this will not change anything about that account it just reduces the chance of your character getting shot due to bad luck now the issues with global passives start when you start getting break efficiency type of passives but even then it doesnt really matter to new accounts or casuals this literally only affects the minmaxxers even without castorice we will see accounts getting through moc without an issue for me i dont see it as anything different from just part of the powercreep i really dont understand why teccy is freaking out while its indicating a negative direction for the game its literally no different from just snowballing through content with therta or any other ss tier main dps in your team so in summary things are already bad in terms of the power creep so that the power level of accounts is vastly different so at this point i think all players should just stop being hardcore invested in the game and just play it for what it is a single player game where you can gamble for characters the newest story is also kinda weak so instead of castorice being the end of hsr the writing team will kill the game first,NEGATIVE,0.9995043277740479,0

the craziest thing i still see regarding this is that end game players currently think her passive is even going to show up for them her passive will literally only help people struggling with content who the fuck is wiping at moc and was thinking man wish i had one more revive i really had them on their last leg no you arent failing content in cycles because of death its because of lack of damage not saying the global idea is good or anything just specifically talking about the usefulness of this passive even if it wasnt global it would still be ass unless of course they start shaping their content around it which would be stupid as hell considering new players after twenty days wont have access to her we shall see,NEGATIVE,0.9962182641029358,0

funny thing is the passive is only really useful during the early game your problem during late game isnt really getting oneshot but dealing enough damage if you die during late game your team or relics just suck thats all aside from the fact that it revives you at hp which doesnt stop your enemy from doing you in during their next turn people didnt cry this much when acheron was released the character can literally skip battles,NEGATIVE,0.994304358959198,0

one of the few sane comments here yes the passive itself is purz garbage for endgame players the only mere impact it could have is to make sustainless teams more accessible to bad players however castorice own mecanic actively wants a healer to gain hp after she lost so she can deal her damage and yes nobody cried about acheron while i personally felt bad having to farm longer bcs i skipped this dumbass bitch raiden mei and my fuckin casual friends spent m chrono in su while i took with great teams,NEGATIVE,0.9984002709388733,0

something i havent seen anybody say on either side is how notreallyinsignificant the passive is defenders say oh but the passive effect is tiny where reasonable people say this one is whatever but it opens the floodgates but when i thought about it its almost comically evil how subtly significant the passive is when you just look at the effect you think that eh its whatever but then consider every time you had a moment where youre into your thth cycle or even more if youre on a worse side at least minutes or just a mode where youre almost at the goal any mess up means lost run and then suddenly all enemies decide to jump at one ally tingyun and nuke that character out of existence while you cant do anything about it no ults not close enough to break enemies in time no emergency heals and then that death causes you to restart as you no longer have the damage to fit in time in the past youd be frustrated but you would know that its just bad rng there wasnt much you could have done but now you will know in the back of your head that if only you had castorice this bad rng moment wouldnt have happened,NEGATIVE,0.9983199238777161,0

yes and no if multiple enemies target that one character and they die from the first attack they will revive but the other enemies in sequence will immediately kill your revived character again this is also true for multiturn characters such as hoolay banakademics the automaton and flamereaver ive been playing castorice myself all day and the revive has only actually helped me once my pela died vs aventurine revived hit the dice and then immediately died the next turn it allowed my acheron to clear the apoc without resetting but since pela died it significantly slowed down my run for someone new i can see how getting any amount of stars would have been satisfactory but as someone who has been playing for some time it still meant i needed to redo the floor,NEGATIVE,0.997805655002594,0
thecalmbeforethemaelstrom i see yeah of course its up to rng you may encounter such a situation where it wont save you you may even be lucky and not get such a scenario at all but you might also have a situation where it impacts the performance and is enough to give you a clear i think it can matter especially when you dont have the best possible team for a specific archetype or boss i remember struggling very badly against last apocs quantum bug and had a few times where i died while being really close to finishing him off in time especially with yunli and as youre saying it also helped you get a clear which yeah can be enough for someone newer or playing less especially with some endgames getting harder longer and more frustrating over time and with how many characters the game is releasing without being very lucky you just cant get all of them especially if you started later and of course it can matter more if they decide to give bosses more damage and specific mechanics that punish not having certain characters which i guess we will only see in the future although if i recall correctly i saw some people complaining about recent moc rotations being noticeably harder in that aspect,NEGATIVE,0.6637512445449829,0

i could make a better point for defending global passives and that point would be that it wont affect of the players since only a minority does endgame where global passives would be usefull and as long as they dont balance the game under the concept of everyone has the character so its fine given not everyone might have the characters as they dont give the character for free its totally fine to have global passives gated behind optional characters there is no competition in the game there are no guilds no leaderboards no pvp its purely a single player experience my account being stronger because i decided to pull for the gacha character is completly irrelevant as the only person afected by it is me but this only applies as long as they dont balance the game around the passives and even if they do it is still irrelevant as im not competing with anyone to see who can or can not clear endgame,NEGATIVE,0.9966956377029419,0

wouldnt everyone having access to the global passive via some tower system be terrible because it would cause the devs to develop the game around having that access which would also just further time gate newer players its not as if the devs designed the game around people having access to an instant overkill button for mobs in the overworld via acheron or chests that would be impossible to find if not for the herta so why would it be different for castorice the appeal to the slippery slope is fallacious if you cant meaningfully demonstrate that slope anyone at any point in time can imagine a slope but i think if were intellectually honest we can all agree that it would be unreasonable to never walk again because you mightve slipped and fell once before,NEGATIVE,0.9979775547981262,0
im pulling castorice bc i want her on my account i have multiple e characters acheron firefly so i dont feel like the passive helps my account i just have wanted her since seeing the teasers ive skipped every banner until now i wont be spending any money on her banner i have guaranteed and enough free earned jades to get her nor will i be going for any eidolons i simply am pulling her because i want her but in regards to the global passive it was not needed nor asked for it just sucks that its attached to castorice since shes a very popular character that people would want to pull for same could be said for people who really like mydei the herta etc etc and if the passive was attached to one of those characters instead now people who have a castorice will be seen as someone who essentially approves of the global passives when majority of us pulling for her are casual players who just like her design and playstyle and the dragon ofc not all upcoming characters will have a gp but any that do will be frowned upon to pull for and it does nothing but cause a divide in the player base bc hoyo wants more money and goes about it in the worst ways possible make hsr great again,NEGATIVE,0.9987782835960388,0

imagine if youre just starting out and you find out theres a character that you must have cus your copy of the game is literally inferior without it its like a dlc but its not available to buy anytime you have to wait for it to and only god knows when itll pop up again its not jsut one dlc but like or more and even if you own maybe or its still inferior cus you need em all,NEGATIVE,0.999657154083252,0
the reasons why global passives on limited stars are good buffs your older characters more incentive to pull new units game is all about meta anyway getting global passive exodia is the future of this game limited stars become future proof even if they are powercrept hoyo can shift the power budget into passives instead of powercreeping every character every patch global passives especially future ones add a layer of convenience for players struggling to balance relics and lacking light cone stats this passive in particular is very nice for sustainless teams in certain scenarios which is a good qol for people lacking meta sustains global passives are just little bonuses and if we get a lot more of them in the future its very likely that in order to keep the game running smoothly there will be a limit on how many can be active at once and that means there is nothing to worry about because you can already acquire most characters even as a fp so that implies you will have plenty of options to choose from just need to wait till more characters come out,POSITIVE,0.8956164717674255,1

because it sets a bad precedent for the industry when a market leader introduced a scummy fomo mechanic that only the most predatory c list games employ it has potential of being introduced in other games if it succeeds ubisoft getting away with single player qol dlc is a good example of this all of a sudden after that a ton of games after that started doing it too most notably bandai namco sony and ea the market isnt a vacuum and when star wars battlefront got massive backlash for its incredibly scummy monetization where u have to play years to earn a character fp after that no other game attempted to be that scummy i know hoyo players may not play other games but this is a gamers perspective on why we care its an eternal battle between predatory monetization and fomo practices and the player in a ever more costly world,NEGATIVE,0.9844046235084534,0

ill explain it this way it wouldnt be bad because they already have the perfect system to tie it in with built into the game already the equilibrium levels it wouldnt be so easy to have it to where after a certain equilibrium level you gain currency to unlock buffs in a linear tree that affect the world and for the whole acheron and therta scenario those two are just gimmicks that arent really that useful outside of the a few exceptions like du for acheron and spamming combat encounters and you could literally just use youtube to find all the chests but for the castorice passive being put to a tower or something you dont really have to reinvent the wheel there if you check your buffs list you will find buff x that you acquired that will give your character extra life after reaching hp they need to either be shielded or healed before their next turn or die as soon as they take there next turn and it would literally be as easy as disabling the passive for endgame modes entirely and the issue is solved not more problem either that or having it only work for castorice hell you could even extend it to any chrysos however its spelled heir characters on your team and itll be way better and cool lore wise sorry for rambling hope you got something useful out of my point of view i can see why youd think the way you do as well,NEGATIVE,0.997759222984314,0
the difference is that acherons and hertas abilities are a quality of life that cant affect late game content castorices global passive does you might have seen how the moc became overtuned where using the same characters people were unable to star moc level when in the moc just before that level bosses had less hp than that level hoyo does and will tune combat encounters around limited characters a tower system would allow everyone to be at the same playing field limited character global passives could fuck over everyone who doesnt have that limited character hoyo could introduce a boss that does a billion damage once per battle if you have castorice its like nothing happened if you dont have castorice then you cant beat that boss if the same boss was made with a tower system being in place then all youd need to do is do the content that gives you the ability to survive instead of having access to a character who might not even be available for years after the first run players gain nothing by having the global passive on a limited character instead of it being tied to an ingame system but players who dont have the character could be at a serious disadvantage compared to ones who do,NEGATIVE,0.9931936860084534,0

kiranightv all of that couldve just been summed to one word could ill repeat myself show me something in all of hsr history where clearing endgame was gatekept by a single limited unit you wont be able to so dont bother youre pointing to one imaginary point on a graph and describing a slope when at least mathematically you need at least two points on a graph to show a slope logically you need many points to even begin to justify a slippery slope appeal furthermore you speak of quality of life as if it cant be applied to endgame when theres nothing mutually exclusive about the two nearly everyone during x complained about their tingyun dying that it became a meme and most of the time it was just bad luck so this prevents one reset and saves time,NEGATIVE,0.9969172477722168,0
gameplayerone boss hps has been increasing with every single moc patch i brought up an example for the biggest jump weve had recently i wasnt bringing up moc because i think it proves that theres a slippery slope the fact that castorice isnt the only limited character with a global passive who will be released during amphoreous is people who have beta access have already confirmed that there are other characters who will have global passives and before you try to argue that theyre not out yet so we wont know if the global passives will stay we had the info about castorice way before she dropped and even though people complained the global passive is still there so theres no reason for hoyo to not make other characters with global passives i was being hyperbolic about a boss dealing a billion damage but i dont see how it would be worse for the players to be able to get the global passive after the character banner isnt available tingyun getting killed because of dumb luck is thing but if you think about it her reviving midcombat is not the same as a new reset lets just imagine a scenario where your sustain cant keep up with the boss damage and your characters get slowly get stacked with debuffs that deal more damage than your sustain can counter we already have stacking damages that enemies can deal and with how the bosses have kept getting stronger with every patch there will be a point where they deal more damage than you can heal now adding in castorices passive will mean that the character who would have otherwise died will continue like nothing happened at that point its not up to luck that your character died its an inevitability but castorice can prolong it long enough to get you through meaning that there absolutely is a way that you be indirectly gatekept by not having her,NEGATIVE,0.9989264607429504,0
kiranightv i dont know why yall cant admit that youre just unable to substantiate your theory save yourself the time also you did just appeal to the slippery slope argument i did assume at first but you confirmed it so my assumption turned out to be correct maybe your assumption about castorices global passive will turn out to be correct too but its just that an assumption,NEGATIVE,0.9984444975852966,0
gameplayerone bro just because you dont understand what im saying doesnt mean that its not substantiated if i bring up a point and you just say nah that doesnt mean youre in the right stop trying to aura farm castorices global passive is a warning sign a red flag that doesnt mean hsr is going to eos immediately but you need to stop huffing copium saying its not that bad because thats exactly how a slope starts ill use this word again it could get better it could make hoyo not have global passives for other characters but having one has already crossed a line and hoyo doesnt have any incentive not to cross it more than once when it brings them more money,NEGATIVE,0.9972180128097534,0
kiranightv its worse than i thought you dont even know what evidence is or maybe im blind because i didnt see you provide any example where endgame was gatekept by a single limited unit or a mechanic unique to them all you seem to have done is point to some general hp inflation and a mere future possibility in which case thats called speculation not evidence i very clearly laid out what i was looking for so i apologize that im not taking your speculation seriously but in all fairness it was a very unserious response unfortunately if you dont even understand what counts as evidence then nothing im saying will make any sense guess well just have to agree to disagree,NEGATIVE,0.9995012283325195,0

making them free is one thing and even then their vastly older units who are tied to a different system instead of being completely removed from the limited pool but again if they were going to move her to standard or make her free they wouldve already announced it its the same reason why they cant change stuff a lot on release,NEGATIVE,0.9943134784698486,0
amari doesnt matter because i am pretty sure my lawyer would find a legal hole in this easily consumer right got massive scope for hoyo to be free of any wromg doing they would have to announce at lunch of game that limited banner units will be put into standard banner sometime during game life cycle making them pullable with free currency that way consumers wouldnt go so hard on those units if they knew that they might become free which if a good lawyer would look at it they would easily find it illegal and a breach of consumer rights and start class action against hoyo and screen through player base of who has set units so they get refunded due to it being false advertisment at start of the game,NEGATIVE,0.9986051917076111,0

except what would constitute as not endgame all the listed versions of endgame youve listed have is just bloated hp pools some random mechanic to give it some spice sim uni is still end game content as all end game content is just repetitive content that gives rewards none of their game modes are that unique people just talk bout them cuz mic and the others are something that mildly stimulate the brain enough to be memorable,NEGATIVE,0.9737632274627686,0

amari i can hop into gold and gears at any level right now i can play du and just do different runs right now i can go and play base sim uni or swarm disaster right now i can do all of that for no rewards and are always i can go and play the rogue like game modes just for the fun of it your definition is just trying to be broad for the sake of it sim uni is giving completion rewards after you reach that point it stops rewarding you you are trying to extend the definition of endgame but you and i both know that when anybody says endgame in hsr they are talking about moc pf and apoc difficulty v sim uni does not register in anybodys mind and even then that game mode makes everyone viable to play by just giving you the stats there is a difference between endgame and gameplay that has difficulty tiers with your logic replaying story missions if we could do that would count as endgame since at one point they gave jades,NEGATIVE,0.9990966320037842,0

yes replaying story content would also be end game since its optional content all rewards do is give people a reason to do the optional content congrats you understand what endgame is now i gotta ask how exactly does any of this change my statement of casuals dont play endgame because all you guys did was pointless yap in a circle over the specifics while going absolutely nowhere,NEGATIVE,0.9981628060340881,0

no i made the point like at the start you just decided you didnt like the answer and popped domain expansion shift goal post to side step the point sim uni and a replayable story mode are not endgame casual players play sim uni casual players do runs in the various sim uni modes even if they dont get rewards casual players also just replay endgame modes for the fun of it to test different teams we got to the point you just keep rejecting it with overly broad definitions,NEGATIVE,0.9994860887527466,0
optional content is endgame content just because theres a specific set of modes that are different that the community solely classifies as endgame doesnt mean anything my main point is hsr doesnt really have much that really worth staying for,NEGATIVE,0.996532678604126,0

these are some crazy bad reasons u have to gamble to get the new character so its not a guarantee that you get the character if you are a fp or light spender it may buff it but its for a price of not being able to pull any character that you want there is already enough incentive to pull new units because they powercrept the hell out of the old ones anyways and are jacking up the hp of every piece of content in the game how is a limited star gonna be future proof if for example a character is just dogshit but has a great global passive like crit rate its just gonna be sitting in your account doing nothing except give the bonus edit i realized that this is future proof this is a bad argument but doesnt change the fact you have to pay for this and you have to choose this over another character that was the point of my argument hoyo just gonna shift power budget into both now both global passive and base kits gonna get more and more nuts its literally their track record this is not a layer of convenience because now you have to choose between a global passive or a unit that you want fps and light spenders dont get enough currency to guarantee a character every patch so whats gonna happen if a patch as global passives just spend just wait for rerun just get lucky because just spend or get lucky is a retarded argument that doesnt even need an explanation if you need to understand that i pray for you now the wait for rerun argument probably gonna get powercrept according to hoyos track record and we dont have enough to guarantee a character a patch and there are new ones every patch so what do people do then this is not a good qol because its not a free qol again you have to pay for this no the global passive will not be little bonuses they will be roadblocks for people who cannot obtain said characters hoyo does not give enough pulls to guarantee a character every patch not to mention their lightcones this doesnt give more options this limits options forcing players to pull on character that have good global passives in order to keep up with the meta if you dont account is worse than someone who does,NEGATIVE,0.9996919631958008,0

karma my initial comment was just pure irony but now that i come to think about it shouldnt you be spending in gacha games anyways like thats the point of gachas theyre not meant to be played for free yes you can try the game and its absolutely free but if you want the best experience then pay up corpas need money and fun activities like playing videogames cost money for the consumer just like going to the movies or going to a club going to a sports event now this sucks for people who cant afford a global passive character but then that means you should probably not be spending your free time playing video games gachas in particular ok actually i dont truly believe in what ive just said but it does feel like people are very disillusioned with games being free and them having the notion that all content should be free too which clearly isnt the case because companies are made to earn money and adding these new passives is a good way to boost revenues and you shouldnt be disappointed with the fact that the company is earning billions either their profits show that they have a successful business model and that they have a good gameproduct and for all its worth you can make a similar game and be earning the same amount of money everyone says oh it costs nothing to develop hsr but dawei needs another yacht he is greedy and stupid ye sure if it was that simple wed have hsr clones on the market yes global passives suck for the average consumer but this is a gacha and if castorices banner beats records then thats just going to prove that hoyo knows what theyre doing,NEGATIVE,0.9988289475440979,0
zarya yea but you can still call out bad practices instead of supporting it i think the most recent example is nintendo switch like seriously paying that much for a console and game as well as a tutorial i get it just do whatever you want but calling out these bad practices seems to be so uncommon in the gacha space maybe everyone is just tuned out but still,NEGATIVE,0.9978163242340088,0
i agree but the community is definitely overreacting on this one a global passive is the same as any powercreep like jingliu like acheron like feixiao like the herta couldnt care much about it its been the same thing every patch everyone keeps playing and keeps pulling and the community is shitting on players for not having eidolonslightconesmeta supports and its never going to be better calling out every bad business practice is the same as calling out everything in every new patch but players are continuing to play the game and it doesnt seem to matter for most and its not our right to stop them from enjoying this predatory game you can hate them though but like xd telling the truth and being a hater to those people who dont care thats not what i want to sign up for ive got other things to care about irl,NEGATIVE,0.9987762570381165,0

it just needed to be a normal passive cas actively kills your team having that safeguard would have been fine all this has shown me is i need to quit not even because of the global passive but because this community desires the game to be shit i cannot wait for the day a global passive increasing pure dmg happens because all this we do not know it will happen again and oh but this one is not that op is going to fall apart at that point and i have zero hope for this game so i would rather it fall off a cliff and provide entertainment at launching at the shit eaters this point hoyo deserves their money with how much they have trapped their minds to support them its impressive really,NEGATIVE,0.9950593709945679,0

the passive on castorice really isnt that bad it just revives a team member that dies and if youre having sustain issues its usually just by not building your sustain correctly or failed a mechanic etc however now that its there the devs can add any passives they want to future characters making power creep worse and worse and making skipping certain characters you might not even want also worse as well since you dont have those passives boosting to your account and lets say you skip every passive eventually the game is going to be balanced around you having a few thats when youre kinda screwed,NEGATIVE,0.9984985589981079,0
its some passive that can revive your whole team just from having her on your account which is mid since they get put at hp and can still die right then and there plus you rarely even die and if you do youre trash tbh but the bad thing is that its making everyone overthink and assume the future of hsr being people being forced to pull for someone because of a passive which we dont even know if its gonna happen or if theres a limit to passives you have in a fight,NEGATIVE,0.9988306164741516,0

all tech companies have sides the developers and the shareholders the latter wants as much revenue as possible and cares about nothing else the former wants to create products which is used and liked by the users the devs give their souls blood and sweat to these games they want us hopefully all of us to enjoy the results of their hard works so they do listen and believe me they want to give more and listen more but they have bosses who care about money and deadlines only about castorice i doubt the global buff will be a trend because none of the upcoming ones have signs of having any but i they do it wont harm the game hi has global buffs left and right and it has little impact also her kind of global passive wont be the standard for those globals because she is an anniversary unit acheron has instant slay and no one else does they did get some useful stuff on their technique but not like hers castorice will also be one of a kind old character buffs are a thing in hi as well in part old characters like super old ones got augment cores you could collect or buy to buff them they didnt become meta but they were very usable as supports for the new characters and each got new skills new moves new look they were not general multilier increases and now eg herrscher of human ego who is liked so is blade and kafka got new life in part with a new weapon which made her compatible with the astral ring system and the new one of that so she can be a support for new upcoming characters it is not a coincidence that the first batch of the buffs will come in blade will likely be able to be a good support for phainon or an alternative right after mydei maybe kafka will go with cypher and seele will go with castorice monetisation its a gacha game they always wanted people to spend lol and in asia people spend so hard some go bankrupt they let you play free games or have free apps on your phone because they want to push you to spend on a consistent basis instead of one big pay it is normal sadly they funnel most of the money into sibling companies like that ai company they have no it doesnt voice things with ai they are doing stuff with bigger impact,NEGATIVE,0.997654139995575,0
why global passive is so bad coz the main problem is not the passive but the main problem is that feature they would give to enemy as well for example in future they make enemy if party have buff from characters is not in the battle field enemy resistance will decrease or enemy will doing less dmg if that come true its will be over for old characters,NEGATIVE,0.9991280436515808,0

it always kinda cracks me up when people make this argument the system was an initial solution to having no guarantee for a unit at all ive heard horror stories about fgo the was an answer to people not liking the and the guaranteed weapon banner in wuwa was a way to get a leg up on the weapon banner hoyo was using now in the case of hsr the new change to the system feels less like a solution to the system and more like a solution to the fact that they have so many limited star units and that there are units who will likely not be able to rotate back in fast enough and they wont be compelling if they received their own rerun banner if a dev chooses to remove the they will without a doubt make it significantly more difficult to hit guaranteed pity wuwa is a perfect example of this they have a guarantee on the weapon but they changed the currency and they only give you limited pulls during the initial portion of the patch that are locked to the character banner this means that any time you roll on the weapon banner it feels like its a pretty big choice and ive personally felt like im incentivized to commit to hitting the weapon this is likely magnified by the star weapons being kinda shit tldr the into was a solution to an old issue in gacha if they move to a guaranteed system we can probably expect pity shifting to something like or less currency,NEGATIVE,0.999293327331543,0

tbh the global passive thing is something im okay with there is currently no team in hsr that relies on revives bailus revive is barely useful bailu is just not useful in general and gepards revive isnt needed in his kit either in fact powercrept has slowed down recently therta ofc being very powerful but aglaea has restrictions and so does mydei and when these more balanced characters come out people are quick to complain how to make them op is to spend money i thought we didnt want them to be op acheron is still useful in every piece of content and can do very very well and firefly performs as well as rappa powercreep is not as doomed as yall claim performance also depends on enemies so it still does fluctuate so many people hated on aglaeas e for solving her issue and to make her broken and same goes with mydei so basically they want a non broken character but also want them to be broken make up your mind for those that dont know e aglaea solves her energy issues and e mydei nakes godslayer be god full aoe dont forget the jiaoqiu doomposting when they made him weak and him being outperformed by pela in some cases the community also takes part in this,NEGATIVE,0.9566013813018799,0

eh its just buisness as usual for a hoyo gacha game and its community at least on the western side some people complain and leave the rest play and enjoy there time playing the game the only ones who truly care about the global passives are the endgame players which make up a very small perecentage anyway the rest just play the story and farm for the new shiny char till the time comes to replace them with a newer even more shinier on,NEGATIVE,0.9987119436264038,0

regarding fgo been playing since day of the jp server so i can tell it took years cant remember exactly how many but probably or before they even gave out a standard selector anniversary stuff never gave limited and the ceiling for a limited is at pulls please never compare hsr to that stupid game regarding the gacha mechanics sure hsr has its flaws but its still infinitely better than fgo fun fact in the beginning fgo pulls didnt even have a guaranteed cost more than now and there was no ceiling for years,NEGATIVE,0.7138584852218628,0

literallyjesus lately they clearly are yeah but i went to check and on fgos second anniversary we only got the equivalent of pulls still talking about jp server dont know if it was the same in global and only because they retroactively increased the rewards from the tutorial otherwise it was just pulls dont get me wrong though id love at least enough pulls for a guaranteed in hsr but unfortunately really popular gacha games are always stingy until their popularity decline like fgo and seeing how genshin is still stingy as hell after years ive lost all hope also its easier to give out pulls when the ceiling is so high since it makes them lose less money in the end,NEGATIVE,0.9982744455337524,0

this looks to me like a change in hoyos monetization strategy it seems like the silicon valley strategy of building a service that starts of user friendly to gather users then slowly increases costs and clamps down and becomes less user friendly a good example of this is netflix that started with low subscription fees and didnt do much about account sharing however they slowly started to increase the fees and clamped down on stuff like account sharing,NEGATIVE,0.9993751645088196,0
you guys are waay too optimistic about the crums we got from this livestream this was litteraly nothing the rewards were nothingpowercrept the story changes are a little too late because they waited for their company to go on fire and the buffs on old units we got no info on that they just droped that they are buffing them to keeps us hooked oh lets not forger castorice haha,NEGATIVE,0.9991539716720581,0
people who think castorice global passive is useful in endgame content are just weird theres no way ur gonna ever need that revive lets be real unless you have skill issue you wont have problems with dying the only thing im afraid of is follow up attack type global passives or the ones that buff your stats entirely im pretty sure hoyo knows what theyre doing i wanna believe it they will understand their mistake by themselves they might wanna add extra menu in team customization that lets you choose which global passive to run for each team this menu will be available if you more than character that has global passive,NEGATIVE,0.9859514236450195,0

the passive tbh is completely useless especially for casual not only she revives you with hp but also its completely pointless cause casual players plays with sustains so if you die with it its literally skill issue and since she needs a healer regardless the complains are understandable only if youre worried that there will be other global passive that could be better than this onethe passive could be decent for cycles purpose but if the enemy kills you and has a second action for example that hp revives will be useless either wayshes only good vs enemies and in gimmick fights like flame reaverher bosstvand nikador other than that shes an easy skip,NEGATIVE,0.9996861219406128,0

it makes the game more predatory than it already is and encourages other gacha games to be even more predatory essentially if they pull this off this leaks into other gacha games easier creating more situations of absurd power creep and must pull situations thus creating more psychological pressure to players to spend more money and companies hope you are oblivious to all of this or make excuses as long as you stay ignorant youre basically spreading your cheeks for them even if you dont spend a dime if you respond with another excuse or dismissal you only further my point just keeping it real,NEGATIVE,0.9892704486846924,0

the first passive ever in hsr is technically acheron acheron is an anniversary character therefore i think that every anniversary character will have a global passive still there are lines one is that you do not change combat values secondly make it balanced castorice passive isnt that bad because any action the character takes makes them die keep this trend going,NEGATIVE,0.9751367568969727,0

destinystriumph lets be honest here for a second the way castorices passive works it is basically useless unless you have a sustain and its an accidental death or bad rng death i replay the endgame quite often and i can count on my hand how many times that would have actually helped me and going sustainless is basically for very tunned accounts with hundreds of hours invested on it already so its effects is also pretty low if you die and ressurect in a sustainless team something is already missing and its a reset anyway the precedent is the problem but again even if all western players unistalled hsr yesterday they would just stop marketing it in the west and be done with it as the asia market basically is who makes the real money and unless a miracle happens the asian community will not give a shit about it,NEGATIVE,0.9997096657752991,0
destinystriumph this characters like ruan mei and the herta technically already has broken global passives in map and su since su was never meant to be balanced and we can switch teams and characters whenever we want if the devs added one line saying castroices passive does not apply in moc pf or apoc it wouldve been fine even somewhat underwhelming its the fact that her global passive affects the endgame content that makes it unfair its basically the devs saying we can implement more broken enemies that will certainly make use of your global passive,NEGATIVE,0.9989657402038574,0

people complaining about the global passive are ignorant the people who are fearmongering about this having a cascade effect onto other gachas are even more ignorant other gachas already have various bonuses reliant on pulling more characters andor more dupes of characters that impact both direct combat and other important system interactions as well as resource acquisition which is still direct power in many of these games as more resources more resin spent on farming gear stronger characters people who are attributing this as a hoyo special are literally by definition tourists hi brax etc the bonus is nearly irrelevant for a supermajority of the playerbase if you already max star clear the content you still will with or without this if you are struggling to clear content then pulling powerful units to actually use on your teams andor vertically investing into units you already own eg robin ruan mei sunday etc is going to give you more power for pull than this global passive if you arent a whale then gacha games are a resource management sim for even your pulls heres the fun part though if you really think casto global passive is so incredibly broken pull her anyone whos been saving since the announcement of her global passive has the ability as a fp player to guarantee her no one cares if you do or dont like her you dont have to have her on your team so if anything that should be a bonus to you i dont like plenty of the annoying af characters in this game and wish i could remove them from my account but look at that every time i go into my character list sampo is still there ratio if you want a example but i dont mind him gacha games are by definition pw you want to know what else is pw in hsr literally everything from the resources used to build your characters to dupes of your characters and their lcdupes of lcs to we even had packs that let you buy relics via buying the packs with dice in them and such complaining about this specifically when stuff that is generally accepted is way more of a problem such as e vs e performance disparity just makes anyone not addressing all these problems seem ignorant in my opinion the dice packs and such were way more of a problem because yes you had extra resin topoffs via spending but relics still felt like one of the ways that you couldnt just whale to win obv again resin refills kind of fit this bill but it felt less egregious tldr casto passive isnt a big deal anyone losing their mind over it gachasmack who also seems to be confused just like brax about the fact that these systems have always existed in gacha games was just looking for a reason to quit anyway ps i think hsr is in a terrible spot but casto passive has nothing to do with that,NEGATIVE,0.9991318583488464,0

i dont think it is accurate to theorize hoyoverse skipped quickly past the global passive because too few people care hoyo is being very cautious with the global passive they didnt address it in detail they put it on a character that will already be pulled instead of anaxa where it would be more obvious and they didnt make it a very strong passive if they are confident there will be absolutely no backlash then why be so conservative in how they add it its the same argument with them buffing older characters kafka and jingliu are popular waifu characters sure who are these casual silver wolf mains who were wanting a buff where are these casual blade mains who are somehow in touch enough to know their character needs a buff but disconnected enough to not recognize a global passive problem if you want to treat casuals as truly braindead swipers who couldnt care less then the only changes hoyo should be making are the story changes any combat or meta changes truly shouldnt matter casuals will just always buy the new characters and there wouldnt be a need to buff the old ones,NEGATIVE,0.9981324076652527,0

cordneyrobinson i never said the game will die i said the community needs to let the game die so it doesnt come to other games which it is wishful thinking to not think it will if proven to be financially successful wuwa i think will try to tweak it a bit to make the community happier potentially but i dont see how this remotely will help the community you are throwing a lot of accusations around when you are saying nothing to actually give proof this wont happen especially since hoyo has already proven time and time again where their bottomline is if you really are just so defensive about this just quit you will be happier since you wont have to defend anything,NEGATIVE,0.9750749468803406,0
mtmartian the proof is that hoyo isnt the first to do this there are a number of games that predate hoyos existence that do this so saying that wuwa is waiting to see if its financially good doesnt makes sense in fact the reason they are doing it because data shows that it is financially good based on data from other games in the genre over the years im not making any accusations per say im just merely pointing out that global buffs not new to gacha space its bringing implemented based on data from other games that have done it in the space of course they will put there twist on it but concept as a whole isnt new hoyo doing this wont change others games because again this isnt a new concept its been done in other games if you play any of the pvp based gachas you will realize how insignificant it is in the grand scheme of things ive played with players that were spending k a week had a friend spend k in a sitting so my point is these global buffs will never hit predatory level at least to the standard of predatory that these eastern cultures spend on game so if you play any gacha and the company is based in east this kind of practice will be the rule not the exception,NEGATIVE,0.998492956161499,0
cordneyrobinson you are trying so hard to defend the global buffs and hoyo who cares if other games have done it before the vast majority of them dont do it for a reason any that have them i will refuse to play so have fun whaling i guess cant wait for hsr to get pvp so it becomes even more whaling intensive trying to say it is financially lucrative when hoyo never needed to do this before and now they decide to do this i find an odd argument they are choosing to try and squeeze the life out of the players continuing to play the game because the game is on a downward trend it isnt going to be good for them long term it benefits no one i really dont care if the east has a spending problem and they eat up this predatory nonsense doesnt mean everyone outside the east just has to like it kuro has shown to try and take some thing and implement them better i dont believe it is a genshin knockoff like people like to say but i think if they somehow frame it in a way that a stupid person thinks it is smart they will go for it if wuwa was released first it would be in the exact situation hoyo is in honestly,NEGATIVE,0.9986230134963989,0
mtmartian the vast majority do lmao u just havent been around long hoyo was one of the first gacha to have a pity system and a system they have improved the space in that aspect before you could spend and get no star characters im not mindlessly defending them im just using critical thinking and global buffs operate on the same premise as edilons moc isnt designed around es characters so why should moc all of a sudden be based around global buffs percent of this is just fomo you mentioned they are trying to squeeze the life out of the players how its not like you have to pull i havent pulled in months and still clear everything and i have a fp with only standard star and i still clear so even the idea that this global buffs is gonna break the game or make you spend is insane you as a avg player are not meant to have every new character and the game is designed in that way if you want every character then you arent a avg player you are a spender because its ridiculous to think you will get every star for free and as a fp it ridiculous to try and build a lot of different characters and teams you should be picking you two dps and vertically build as a fp alot of the problem in this game come from rss mismanagement and poor pull choices i personally havent spent since fei first dropped and i still cycle both sides with acheron and fei but these are my only two teams and dps and ive vertical in vested in them,NEGATIVE,0.9991450309753418,0
mtmartian i do agree if the gameplay suffers from it then it will be a problem but they havent done anything to suggest that because the game is still designed to be beat by e variants of units and the end game isnt built for the e variants even tho the buffs are there and available to everyone there track record shows they will still make everything clearable for a e player because the game has to be beatable no matter when someone starts playing so they cant even design the game around buffs like that because the barrier of entry alot of the fear comes from fomo cuz no one wants to miss out or feel like others have advantages over another thats why e players get killed for being unrelatable rather than being like oh snap u got the e cool lol,POSITIVE,0.5612305998802185,1
that is great you can clear it fp but leaks are suggesting the fate collabs will also have global passives and they will probably have another before also what happens in will they have two global passives what if they design an enemy that kills you outright to make the castorice passive mandatory in moc this is not a fp thing at all and they also are having a spending event to promote spending they are clearly telling you who this is for not everyone is lucky in this game so they wont be able to get everything it just sets a bad precedent what happens in when your vertical invested dps units are useless because power creep is increasing at a fast rate i also still dont understand why you think just because a different game does it that all of a sudden makes me wrong a few games can be wrong at once i have played a lot of gachas as well and none of them have had it if you played the more predatory ones hey congrats on promoting their practice more and more to give star rail ideas,NEGATIVE,0.9994410872459412,0
mtmartian so we are more or less on same page it really just comes down to how they handle it ive played games its been really good and games its been horrible as long as moc and the other end game modes dont require the global passives but just make it easier then it really wont effect anything but like you said if they make enemies directly make u need a global passive to complete it will be predatory so it really depends how it goes going forward if its tame like percent here percent there things like that it wont be game breaking we will have to wait and see how it is handled and how they handle old units buffs we can make a judgement after a few moc and see if her passive changed anything,NEGATIVE,0.9981772899627686,0
cordneyrobinson if you see it that way it is fine but to me the game has fell off after act of penaconny so i was already losing interest to me what the game does now regardless doesnt matter with the implementation of global passives just sucks how much i enjoyed the game a year ago and just hasnt really grabbed me since i honestly find genshin a better game right now in like every way funnily enough i might come back in a year to check it out like i do with feh and afk journey but honestly this game pissed me off more than both of those games did so might be longer or not at all,NEGATIVE,0.9871349930763245,0
mtmartian i absolutely agree i did not enjoy penacony and amp is lackluster i dont feel the need to play story like i used to the lack of voice acting and cutscenes is ridiculous and all the quest feel dry i think they need to come up with some more game modes and introduce a new cast of stars ive already stopped spending just waiting to see how stuff shake out with old units buffs cuz i wanna use jingliu and blade more often,NEGATIVE,0.9995872378349304,0
thats because fob is slightly and it is kinda slight wrong with his china narrative its true that the passive isnt inherently a big deal on cn though some do have an issue with the global passive powercreep has become something of an issue there they dont like how hard endgame is getting at its current rate and how quickly units are becoming worthless yes they have a much higher tolerance for pw and powercreep than over here but its still just a tolerance theres still a limit and hoyo is kinda starting to push it how much more they can push it remains to be seen but given the other issues hsr currently has i imagine its not much more there have been many story complaints too which is probably why theres the update,NEGATIVE,0.9982818365097046,0
chinese fanbase is quite easily appeased or controlled compared to global audiences they are used to that living standards so hoyo is slowly making them accepting must pull units for hsr they know chinese fanbase will bow down in time if they drip this kind of characters slowly,NEGATIVE,0.9825823307037354,0

the issue isnt competition it simplifies down to two big problems one it makes people to pull for characters outside of their actual appeal as a gacha character yeah meta pulling in gacha is a losing game but it doesnt make it any less scummy two endgame will be balanced around global passives as they slowly stack up itll screw over everyone who likes characters who arent shilled with passives,NEGATIVE,0.9977872371673584,0

definitelynotahedgehog you see your fatal flaw was thinking that the guy replying has a skill called reading comprehension when in reality its an ultra rare ss tier skill that only the advanced humans have also yeah honestly id be fine with global passives if they give one to every limited star and make it so you can only have enabled at a time but since its literally just castorice its just a display of favoritism on a level hoyo has never gone to before,NEGATIVE,0.9947693943977356,0

they have displayed high levels of favouritism before castorice but now they are just breaking the games logic i truly think people should stop thinking the skill is fine the problem is the future because the whole point of the god daam game is that at the very least the characters has to be an active member to activate its ability acheron herself came with a fucking skip battle button that to this day works perfectly fine i dont like that they did that to this day but at least they gave it a limitation that she has to be in the team and it doesnt function on elites castorice has a total of limitions the only thing stopping it being that you need heals or shields wich is something all endgame teams will have outside of cycles its fucking abysmal,NEGATIVE,0.9918166995048523,0

i think you can see global passive as something to make your game easier to play in the future and for future i mean like even or they wont keep giving global passive to every new character and this isnt even the first global passive character acherons instant kill is also one like for now some player already dont main her but still use her for exploring and in simulated universe if they give us global passive character periodically like every anniversary i think its ok also the good way of global passive is even if the character got powercreep you can still play easier even you dont got the strongest character in the future thats actually good for fp the only two thing we need to worry about are keep giving global passive character every new update and you must need global passive character to win a game but i believe these two wont happen mihoyo is greedy but not stupid ofc they know if they do that players will be leaving,NEGATIVE,0.965772807598114,0

for people thinking that this isnt that big of a deal and the passive isnt even that strong you have to remember that this isnt just about the passive itself and how good it is its also about the precedent this sets that hoyo can just lock huge shit like this behind the gacha and because hoyo is currently the biggest gacha company other smaller games will follow suit which will result in the gacha space a pretty predatory space already becoming more predatory,POSITIVE,0.9442960023880005,1

viktoraloz wuwa is constantly improving taking players feedback and implementing it by saying its perfect youre essentially stating that it should make no further improvements loving a game is good but worshipping it is not it will only stagnate the games growth wuwa is appreciated on the basis that it listens to its playerbase why are you calling it perfect because a perfect game simply does not exist as a perfect game would imply it needs no improvements,POSITIVE,0.9900892972946167,1
as you should,POSITIVE,0.9985396862030029,1
but doesnt the developers lining up for any request from players elevate the games status to perfect i think thats true i hope that my request to add an even more naked character with an even larger chest size will also be satisfied because the developers really listen to the players and it would also be great if they removed the limit on flights i also asked them to add the ability to collect chests in aoe so i dont have to look for them its too boring on the other hand they could remove chests from the game altogether its a relic of the past from genshin and send all the currency and resources to the mail at the beginning of the patch this would make the game not just perfect but ideal,POSITIVE,0.990980327129364,1

galahadxh many units have a revive and in most content that revive is useless end game anyways since you need heals or a shielder and if youre dying then you may as well reset anyways im sure some runs might get saved or have less resets to clear but it doesnt matter for most playres actually doing end game and story content is generally easy enough that you dont need that either the issue is the later implementations of global passives,NEGATIVE,0.9988436698913574,0

galahadxh still that is a super niche case nearly nobody will think oh of going to go for e just for the revive and while i understand you still get max stars the goal is still to not have characters dying and if your a competent player you shouldnt have anyone dying ever unless you are using your healers wronf,POSITIVE,0.994209885597229,1

you are right since meta has nothing to do with this issue why are people making a fuss you said it is bad please elaborate,POSITIVE,0.988013744354248,1
its primarily because pushing global passives in the form of characters instead of how other gachas do it which is just a free grindable system basically just says to hoyo that they can make characters as non fp as they want whether its make more stars with these effects scaling content with the intent of needing to roll these units which mobs or not or potentially moving these ideas to their other games,NEGATIVE,0.9947033524513245,0
i always feel that whether to roll for a limited star characterweapon is up to the player hyv is not forcing anyone to pull anything there is no mustpull characterweapon as a fp from the day of release of hsr other than onwards i have all the supports except jiaoqiu and substains except huohuo my teams do not need the revival global passive of castorice but im still pulling for her because i like her design global passives are beneficial to my teams as that means i do not need to level up characters to use the passives imagine buffs energy regen shields heals are in character passives maybe then i just need to bring dpsers and dont need to pull so many characters a bit farfetched but even if it happens we are probably at the end of hsr journey,POSITIVE,0.9519007205963135,1
at that point why not just actually do wat other games do and just make a free system that does the exact same thing the issue is the fact that theyd rather go the scummiest way possible just sell more characters rather than make interesting systems that have proven to work to make the game more interesting you could easily do way more with standalone systems but instead they chose the worst way possible cuz they know no one is going to complain,NEGATIVE,0.9997420907020569,0

andrinaleong its almost like having a good system is just good to have in any game again the point im getting at is why not just make it a whole system that accomplishes the same goal instead of just making characters each with a passive like this,POSITIVE,0.9854868650436401,1
i wouldnt like it as it gives me the feeling of repetition or copying of other games for example i started openworld game with genshin and when i tried wuthering waves i had a hard time going through x because the feeling of playing genshin again comes in even looking at the wuwa interface menus gives me that feeling and it is quite unbearable i believe if i had started with wuwa or other openworld games first it would give me the same unenjoyable experience i do not like to play games that have thingssystems that are too similiar,NEGATIVE,0.9984737038612366,0
because other games already have it i already said i would not like this to be implemented as i dont like games to copy one another also when people complain in the feedback i hope that they do suggest an alternative solution to the problem talking is easy solving problem is not anyway there is no point discussing this topic any further as everyone has hisher own opinion ill stick to mine,NEGATIVE,0.9989591836929321,0

people are saying that this incentivizes greedier practices its not about what the global passive its about the implication of what hoyo knows what they can get away with when they release characters the goalpost always gets moved it may seem like a nothing burger now but eventually powercreep will start affecting global passives as well and itll be to the point where not having a unit will place your account behind,NEGATIVE,0.9979144930839539,0

firasj based on what people said most likely it will get reverted before v of the beta and look how that turned out do you seriously think they will deactivate peoples abilities they paid for ofcourse not they want as much money as possible so theyre going to release more of these characters to pull and if they allow them to stack it gives you less reason to skip if you like youre existing passive,NEGATIVE,0.9982960820198059,0
not sure if acherons tech counts as a global passive if it only works with her on the team let alone input to activate it a passive doesnt require input acherons technique at least requires her to be on the team castorice revive does not she just needs to exist on the account period its not entirely the end of the world about it at least to me but i understand why it can be seen as a dark precedent for the future units that come with passives that work outside the team,NEGATIVE,0.9983415603637695,0
avertburden my bad i should be clear what i wanna said is a similar situation with acheron and castorice for acheron shes for exploring map and play simulated universe easier but you can play without her for castorice shes use for avoiding your team accidentally died and need to restart the game but if you do build your sustain well you can also play without her for people who said castorice global passive destroying hsr are stupid what really matter is they keep giving out tons of character with global passive or make global passive too op will mihoyo know these too and change idk lets see,NEGATIVE,0.9958445429801941,0
the reasons i think they will only allow one active at a time is simply because stacking these buffs will literally break the game if i thought of adding this then i will simply give it to a new character and to the trailblazer and allow one at a time i dont know though how they will work with the buff but they wont allow them to stack since this will break the game,NEGATIVE,0.7824245095252991,0

yesno can you use acheron ability in mocpfapo i say castorice global passive same as ruan mei passive but the different is she only work in su if castorice passive didnt work in the end game content trust me no one would complain she gives advantage even its little its still is and she only need to exist on the account,NEGATIVE,0.9831427931785583,0

kennethyoung i dont think youre getting the actual point yes the examples he gave were exaggerated but the point is that before that wasnt even a possibility because global passives were not a thing now since they are a thing it has become a possibility that something along those lines would exist i doubt something as broken as that but maybe idk and thats good for absolutely no one really besides hoyo becasue they maybe make more money because of it idk,NEGATIVE,0.9964354038238525,0
kennethyoung the fact they are scared about that as you say is because everyone can have access to them without paying them you cant really compare a star lc and a farmable set vs limited characters gallagher himself had probably been one of their most failed creations for the sole fact he is way too good they are not on our side,NEGATIVE,0.9980918765068054,0
fran i mean if they just wanted money they could sell skins thats way easier money from all types of players instead of only making a mechanics that meta focused player would care about,NEGATIVE,0.9985460042953491,0
melowmelow gallagher is quite balanced he was made with supporting the new meta in mind of attack frequency break and debuffs without gallagher many people wouldnt have a good fp option for characters like acheron firefly or feixiao which were the main dps units of x they also made remembrance mc for free and they are more cracked than they make fp character really good now because thats the power level they need to be worth using,POSITIVE,0.7777010202407837,1
you dont need it for end game either in fact its mostly useless there you have unlimited tries in runs and if youre dying in your end game runs youre already doing something wrong anyways so it doesnt matter thats not the issue the issue is global passives that start providing damage buffs or something or if they add pvp which i also dont see happening to be honest,NEGATIVE,0.9988232254981995,0
thats true ive survived whole x versions without robin aventurine huo huo was able to clear all endgame and now in x im still doing okay without therta and aglea in fact i didnt pulled any x character yet,POSITIVE,0.9538745880126953,1
so do you think people would be complaining if they were making skins i believe every single person would prefer that alternative gallagher is by far the best star in the game in my opinion they also made match th wich also is a godsend for fp players and even competes with topaz on feixiao comps and the mc is really cracked with his only downside being you can only have type of mc at a time wich is fair but i really cannot find any justifiable measure to implement a game mechanic that applies in combat without said character that has the mechanics even being in your daam active team if we would use the lore acurate reason they used in the stream we could use the same argument for every single other character that has a major role numby can be in any team cuz topaz lends him to you fu xuan can negate team wide attack cuz she predicated it before the fight started and all the other bullshit reasons they can come up with if every single character is limited to active team slots why in gods green earth should any other character not be,NEGATIVE,0.99839848279953,0

mubta first of all you are assuming they are coming back like its the only game they can play people play games for enjoyment and for others especially on games like gacha their longevity this game is mid at best and i am glad i quit this game by maybe not spending anything coz i already learned my lesson in genshin also helped the influx of new players are not going up but thinking people will return just because of gacha addiction is just plain stupid there are games much better than this getting released everyday and this game just continues to go more and more predatory ps one global passive wont matter but after the fifth or sixth global passive in the consecutive release mattered as they factor these in when designing endgame would hurt like hell and i am waiting for people who are defending this mechanic get this bit on their ass,NEGATIVE,0.9994511008262634,0
megumin i really doubt theyre going to make it where you can have multiple global passives at once and whos to say they wont give older star characters that people already have global passives as well they could include them into silver wolf or kafkas kit and continue that trend with other stars as well when they get their respective buff,POSITIVE,0.8929486870765686,1

its not just about how strong the passive is or if it can stack or whatever the problem is that president this sets that hoyo can just lock something as big as a global revive behind gacha and because hoyo is the biggest gacha game company other gacha games will follow suit so all this does is make the gacha space a already predatory space even more predatory,NEGATIVE,0.9973830580711365,0

theres one bandaid for this situation it is by no means a fix however hoyo should give every player a free castorice so everyone has the global passive on their account they should just take the l and consider global passives a failed experiment and never make another character with a one ever again and they seriously need to find a way to slow down or eliminate this hp inflation that keeps getting worse with every patch,NEGATIVE,0.9994507431983948,0

wow i heard about the drama but i thought it already died i totally forgot about it but this video is the proof od how vocal minority think they are majority and how they are easily manipulated by videos and propagandas made to scare them the real problem that actually exist is ignored heavy powercreep and meta enforcement to clear even the story content but when something insignificant like this is happening morons in the community make it as it was the big threat same kind of drama was created when arlecchino got her weapon idiots there also were scaring everyone that this bad and other crap like you dont have to own it and now people are literally saying cringe stuff like they will hate castorice justifying toxicity and they think its fine the global passive changes literally nothing its just another reason to decide if you want character or not but thats nothing else its not something that will actually change anything if i didnt want to get castorice since i wouldnt and definitely such a minor passive effect wouldnt convince me and people saying its a new quality of character thats so dramatic and full of lies like its like saying archons in genshin should be stars they are clearly superior especially with furina being able to walk on water and stuff people didnt believe furina would be able to walk on water because its too op before it was even announced now nobody makes a big deal about it because there are no propagandists who say this is a threat and a bad thing but people tried to scare people with how bad arlecchinos signature is like somehow having a skin for character is okay but if weapon is cool when you use it with character is a scam same mentality there and here scaring people for something that doesnt even matter at all on top of that group of people think they represent everyone most people dont care and arent such incels gacha community is so dumb and toxic they enforce their own stupidity on others and think they are absolute right especially when thy are absolute wrong like in this case stop spreading negativity misinformation and toxicity all of you why were you ignoring powercreep for years but when one character gets global passive that is more like a bonus its suddenly bad thing why do i even say this obviously its like talking to antivaxxers they always know better than actual professionals,NEGATIVE,0.9987109899520874,0

let me shed some light for the cute lil brains of those whose so called a player who cares for their favorite game logically speaking in turnbased games the difficulty is the selling point so lets break it down to two core points about turnbased gacha games selling characters with simple mechanics whats mainly being sold here is influence and story engagement but as we all know hoyoverse has trashtier writing only saved by solid execution selling mechanics and mustpull characters every patch obviously there are only two target markets hardcore players whales simps or casual players who in general dont really contribute much to the games revenue hoyoverse as a dev committed to its games not players still needs big fundingespecially after breaking off from tencent and you heard theyre cooking up another honkai title right that ones running on ue this isnt about balancing or caring for the players its about server sustainability no point in catering to fp or lowmid spenders if true whales especially from mainland just want their waifus to exist as they imagine sacrificing whales means hoyo runs at a deficit simple what comes next stagnation its clear hoyo wants to keep their game alive but theyre stuck in a player dilemma just look at how many revisions the casto kit went through that speaks volumes no need to compare with stuff like wuwa which is openworld or fgo thats a different story fgos surviving off player loyalty and its whales are consistent thats why it stays at the top of income charts hoyos playerbase mostly just casuals looking for a stress reliever they dont spend much and thats why hoyos in a pinch why do i keep bringing up whales because without whales the company dies period and dont think breaking from tencent means theyre on good terms if were talking domino effect theres no way your shiny new waifuhusbando wont get gp characters that are clearly designed to be hyped will always be given that treatment at least of new installs are banking on those characters getting gp thats just how it is thats the basic logic most people only think about how gp affects casuals and new players but if youre the type who rolls for every fav char every patch you should already understand the consequences so why blame the corp theyre just tailoring characters based on current market demands and what does the market want now waifuhusbu wars meta flexing character supremacy so no hoyo isnt wrong for releasing gp at the end of the day theyre just giving players what theyve been asking for this whole time ugh this games too easy bro wheres the challenge my waifu better be meta dude people complained the game was too easy so they dropped gp now everyones whining this is the result of players own actions,NEGATIVE,0.9989945292472839,0

im going to say this global passive is a new mechanic and of course placing it on the newest anniversary unit is something that should be acceptable my greatest example is dokkan battle where the anni or wwdc units introduce a new mechanic get the new st monotype leader buffs nd anni nd wwdc category leader passives leader passives mechanics rd anni transformations th anni active skills th anni new leader skills th anni revives th anni intro skills th anni standby skills th wwdc field buffs th anni taunt skills th anni swapping unit feature all of the new units and even fp or standard banner units got one of these mechanics people are getting angry for a new mechanic which will comeback with more fp friendly units is it affecting power creep absolutely power creep cannot be evaded however honkai has this problem since its st anni and it should be addressed like acheron literally has a different ult mechanic and passive structure where you have to run nihility units to make her dps stronger we might get a unit fp or star options and well have some good buffs in my opinion we should get more fp friendly stars since we only got moze as a star and hes aint even fp since he works with fua and some people dont have dr ratio because it was a limited time event overall i can understand why people are mad and but its a basic gacha game feature that has happened and is still happening to this day honkai lacks a good fp roster and that we can all agree and i feel like we should get buffs also buffs for dan heng natasha and asta global passives will be accessible and im positive about it i can understand that a revive mechanic is insanely broken and bailu has it only for unit and she aint the best healer but its an anni unit of course shell be top tier again dokkan is an good example where most of the time the major celebration units were considered as the best units in the game and are the most of the time the top grossing same with saiyan day tanabata wwdc golden week goku day etc,NEGATIVE,0.948342502117157,0

i guess the original purpose of the global passive is to make units that could be easily powercrept to have some value even when they are no longer meta which is good at first glance but this creates more problems firstly this exposes the fact that the devs have no plans on buffing dps units since they still have some value when not being deployed secondly this kills the whole purpose of teambuilding if the effect lasts even when the units not on the field players will lose incentive to use other characters creatively or strstegically,NEGATIVE,0.9997310042381287,0

got my c castorice,POSITIVE,0.8901011943817139,1
my personal reason of which i think castorices global passive isnt a good idea is because it simply has no cost the cost to using any other characters ability is rooted in them taking up a party slot a universal cost for every chraracter so far castroice goes and breaks that by having an ability which holds infinite value because of the passive having no cost associated with using it given how theyve implimented the global ui i do also agree that theyre more than likely to add more global passives and thatd have the same issue as castorices global where there is no cost associated the only way i can personally see them balancing a system like this is making it so that only a set number of globals can be active at once as well as possibly providing some free global passives because at that point globals will probably function similarly to lightcones things that augment or add onto your teams playstyle,NEGATIVE,0.9947742819786072,0
honestly the fsn collab is one of the only things that keep me in this game i have been skipping the whole amphoreus for it so you can see what i really value the most its just sad that the powercreep is so strong in the game its hard to have fun when endgame tries so hard to shove characters that you dont want down your throat,NEGATIVE,0.9987882971763611,0
unpopular opinion fps should not be able to full clear end game unless theyre the sweaty type last i checked mhy isnt an npo and afaik theres no evidence yet that theyre selling players personal data for profit so they benefit almost zero from allowing fps to be able to full clear end game id even argue that allowing general fps to be able to full clear end game would even hurt the games longterm health as a few vocal fps will definitely start shitposting spenders all over the place for not being smart and spent money on this game which you could have cleared without spending at all,NEGATIVE,0.9996482133865356,0

im not a hsr player so i can say this as someone standing on the sidelines making a character have a global passive that takes affect even if they arent in the party is unacceptable if she had that effect if she was in the party then itd be fine it still sounds kinda busted but its fine but it being global for everyone forever that is not okay even if her buff was something insanely tiny like atk globally it still wouldnt be okay,NEGATIVE,0.9992220401763916,0
in practice the global passive isnt quite as earthshattering as some people have tried to make it out to be not you vars this was a great breakdown having used it to push my limits in moc i can say it is super easy to basically get no value out of it it doesnt clear status effects so if you get a dot slapped on the revived character they die immediately before getting to exploit the passive honestly the best use for it is hoping a super slow character that provides an off field effect is the one that gets revived due to how much value youd still retain until you hit that healshield or die check jade with the poets set is probably the best at the moment,NEGATIVE,0.9425503015518188,0

at the end of the day if the game still makes money in the long run then it will prove to be the right decision for them it means they knew their market and it worked because i would like to believe that hyv just like any other tech company is making datadriven decisions so well know in time,POSITIVE,0.9943513870239258,1
hypothetical if and only if they balance the game around the experience of relatively new players then global passives can be beneficial for the longterm health of the game it will still be largely fomodriven and risky to say the least but ultimately if new players are able to clear without them then their experience will be quite fine players who would already have multiple global passives on the other hand wouldnt need to feel too pressured to pull for too many new units since they would be getting buffs from their entire character roster making it easier for their older units to clear new content regardless would this be better than just reducing powercreep probably not will they actually go this route i wouldnt bet on it,NEGATIVE,0.6653671264648438,0

the passive itself is soso i initially thought it was worthless because i thought the unit will die again if they arent healed before their next action it seems like they do actually get a full turn first tho which can make it useful for sustainless cycles but you are right its the precedent being set that is the major worry for players and rightfully so almost equally scummy is the extreme whale festival theyre holding with the anniversary an event based on how much you top up is disgusting and theres no other way to interpret it the character shop is another one that is catered to whales i did actually get one silver companion spirit upon logging in because i have e bronya as a mo player but i think im in the extreme minority there i did pull castorice because i need a modern dps but over all im not happy about this anniversary,NEGATIVE,0.9991695880889893,0
as fp my problem is more thematic i dont care about meta or late game content so if this leads to powercreep once i cant keep up i will just stop i play for the fun i have today so stopping in the future does not represent loss to me i have the same relation to games i do spend on i support the devs for the fun i have and not for the fun i might have in the future so quitting is not a loss not to me anyway what irks me is that all players will experience the story the same but some will spend tickets and that makes castorice like them more while those that dont spent she will just ignore what about the players that get her with single ticket why are they treated differently for such low investment why are players who lose ignored by her the devs make her look like golddigger intentionally or not,NEGATIVE,0.9975080490112305,0

so the only issue everyone has with castorice is her global passive ask yourselves this question and answer yourself honestly how often do your characters die even if they do you mostly reset because you messed up your rotation somewhere somehow not only that but her passive isnt even a full on revive when acheron came out noone complained her technique being able to instantly kill enemies but we all know exactly how good that technique is even better than castorices passive but i do agree about powercreep they are going overboard with enemy hp inflation even in main story sometimes enemies are really tough,NEGATIVE,0.567272424697876,0

i feel like hoyoverse is so inexperienced when running a turn based game their only way of increasing end game difficulty add more hp on enemies and let newer characters deal more damage with this hp inflation even if they do buff characters i think they will become irrelevant in a few months i dont care if new characters are op but i do care that my il danhengs k damage cant even kill mobs in end game contents that is how bad the endgame inflation is heading,NEGATIVE,0.999735414981842,0

global passives like this are a really cool concept for a big reward after a difficult questline or somethingif we were talking about a normal rpg where it does not involve spending money given the passive they gave castorice is not that strong to begin with even if you trigger the effect any slap on he wrist will still knock you down for good and a character going down realistically only happens in high difficulties of su this is never the reason you dont get stars in any game mode but a lack of damage output is the only problem as stated in the video is that this opens the floodgates for more effects like this,NEGATIVE,0.9915766716003418,0

everytime i see this argument i bring up the following remember when acheron released and she is able to kill overworld enemies and everyone basically said the same that is is broken and they can now just remove all overworld enemies because all caharacters will have that now and in the end in was just her the anniversary character maybe just maybe it is the same effect here that because cas is the anniversary character she has a unique skill i am not saying it might not happen but all i am saying maybe dont throw the baby out with the bathwater just yet people are too quick to judge when something similar happened a previous time and nothing else came of it it was unique to only ever character,NEGATIVE,0.9954749941825867,0

renbananacatsoup no practical effect in end game content acheron made du super quick and easy to clear as well as any event that has overworld enemies with acheron you can complete most if not all story content without having to worry about health issues her technique is extremely useful but also changes the game if you have her vs if you dont castorice on the other hand if you have not experienced the moon cocoon effect yet is very nuanced and unless you finely plan to the last detail including when the boss will hit you will not help bit for the most part as an example i tested her skill and played really badly as i have actually built my characters and have sustains that keeps me from dying but i went and played like the worst possible and depending if you have luck and how quick your other characters are the effect of moon cocoon will be useless the following was the scenarios i found rmc was too quick so before my sustain could act they already got their next turn and thus they died cause unlike what ccs are telling you your character cannot act again they literally only have till their next turn to get a shield or heal if not they die as their turn comes around lingsha was killed during the first swipe of flame reaver shocking i know lingsha never dies but as i said i had to play super bad to see effect she got resurrected flame reaver went into second swipe and lingsha died sometimes yes you will get lucky and her skill can help but it is not worth throwing the baby out with the bath water over that possible chance that you might be saved by a unique skill that is probably given to her due to it fitting her lore and her being an anniversary character but her skill only works once so if for example the flame reaver swipe its swipes kill a character they get resurrected if he swipes again and that kills characters they do not get resurrected if i had to choose between castorice and acheron i would say acheron is the more broken mechanic and changed the game much more than castorice that is a good unit but has a buff that will probably if ever dependent on how good you play mostly work out on her party as she sucks the life force dry of everyone around her,NEGATIVE,0.9976450800895691,0

just pull for game changer characters like castorice and stop pulling for crippled ones easy me personally would stop pulling after castorice and just wait for the next big thing also pulling for characters you like is the most brainless way of using your limited resources cox its not even an open world game like genshin where you can roam using you favorite character sheess btw hsr on the next gacha pvp will get top beating that prn game called lads and that pokemon junk,NEGATIVE,0.9995410442352295,0

i dont hate the idea of global passives theres only so much you can do with unique characters in a turnbased game especially when elemental reactions dont play as big a role but this is something that needed to exist from the beginning of the game and needs to be limited say you can only have one or two global passives active at a time something like elemental resonance from genshin not ideal but then i think if this was in hsr from the start and it wasnt so powerful right off the bat i dont think anyone would be complaining context i dont play hsr just genshin lmao im sorry if im missing context took one look at the game being turnbased and noped out of there and im glad i did,NEGATIVE,0.9922526478767395,0

i am of the opinion that hoyo will destroy hsr purely based on greed and will not do anything to truly address any of the core problems what theyve been doing so far is introduce more powercreep or storytelling elements stronger characters with hp sponge enemies that require the character to even clear comfortably excessive yap and white text on black screen and are trying to bandaid it with character buffs that will be obsolete in patch and black text on white screen with how badly theyve been milking the game i guarantee you theyll make more of these permanent problems and offer temporary solutions until the game is well and truly dead,NEGATIVE,0.9997802376747131,0
its already happening as i said in another video for me whats also an issue is that hoyo will scale hsrs endgame to the latest shiny unit they have they buffed the enemies hp for acherons release then feixiao and now most likely for castorice so she has an autorevive which used to be reserved for older units e that can activate even when shes not in the party gee i wonder if theyll release enemies with instadeath abilities or deal damage that can bypass shields and leave your units at hp wait a minute,NEGATIVE,0.9949945211410522,0

ill try to add perspective and preface by saying to enjoy whatever game you want not judging you the people that feel her global passive isnt a problem likely just ignore the valid points people make everyone kept saying yes her particular passive isnt broken or godlike that isnt what people are talking about it is the obvious precedent they are making trying to normalize this which inherently makes the game and potential other gachas more predatory than they already are they already did this with genshin btw constellations that wasnt standard in gachas duplications in gachas traditionally just give stats and that is it genshin helped normalize tying critical aspects of a characters kit to there dupes and sometimes weapons which of course makes the game more predatory acheron troubling you with that nihility restriction wellet me tell you about her e similar case with global passives they dip there toes in the water conditioning players to accept it then gradually increase how powerful they become to entice more money and resources it is standard stuff not trying to be toxic or hateful towards you btw if you enjoy the game and castorice more power to you please enjoy any video game you want just offering perspective maybe you didnt see what people meant because plenty in the community are ultra toxic and pad there criticisms with a ton of insults hopefully i conveyed this respectfully to you,NEGATIVE,0.984638512134552,0
godofgoblins o yea ya you good thank you even yours doesnt sounds aggressive and more reasonable i do wanna add too that i dont really follow news casto doesnt grab my attention not pulling her so when the global passive news pops up everywhere i thought maybe this is really a big problem even i dont look for it the recommendation are everywhere so it spark my curiosity on how casto played out after release and thats my comment on that now i think about it yea genshin copies do give value on actionnumber compared to others that just give small stats but whats predatory about it isnt that how developer get creative with what they sell and how it give player another experience from the chars i play genshin fp and still feel rewarded without copies plus theres no need for cons or even sign weapon i think this is the nd game i played after ak that doesnt made me feel pressured to pull every banner i cant say the same for hsr some chars made me need to pull sign but it doesnt hinder my progress on end game still all clear gacha nowadays just need to gain game experience and manage account better right or i am missing the point cause i just start reading here and there about game and how they perceive just around this year,NEGATIVE,0.9955220222473145,0
so you realize the second part of your sentence is countered by the first part right you literally just said it the issue isnt the power level of the current passive everyone basically agrees it isnt ultra powerful or a big deal it is the precedent it leaves for them to obviously push for stronger ones which leads to a more predatory environment than it already is and its hoyoof course they will they can go ahead and release a global passive that does some def shred you dont counter the argument with ok but i have a character that can def shred again you need to see the obvious bigger picture here before you know it they will start doing global passives where you get an extra turn and you decide to say ok but bronya can give me another turn so like look just like how they try to normalize constellations in genshin this is another means to try and make the game more predatory to make money its simple not hating or judging you btw if you like the game please continue to enjoy just stating the obvious yes it is an issue but if you dont care that is fine enjoy but if you dont understand why its an issue hopefully i elaborated on that a little,NEGATIVE,0.9808746576309204,0
you did not watch the video the problem is not the passive but rather what it represents today is a revive tomorrow it will be crit and the day after break damage and then def and hp and then more and more and more pretty much the only thing i do agree with has to be the social media part filled with negativity but everything else is wrong,NEGATIVE,0.9994599223136902,0

didnt know about castorices passive until now but in seeing this i do feel like the most likely outcome is a pretty simple one having played genshin since day i know what a dev who barely pays its community any notice looks like and while the dev team of genshin gives us things we want four to five years down the line hsr is pretty quick to listen and in my opinion has been doing a pretty good job of it too i think this way castorice has this passive to be cool and themey and to apply fomo fomo that i suspect is fake because while slightly worse id suspect that the next tb is going to have a similar passive lets say its abundance itll be slightly weaker to incite you to buy castorice on reruns say the deaths door effect is only cancelled if healed to full or shielded of their health kind of thing and heck maybe doesnt even require tb to be in abundance it seems pretty thematic that the benefits of abundance come with consequences you cant get rid of its kinda yaoshis whole thing,NEGATIVE,0.9931396842002869,0

i really do think that global passive isnt a big of a deal first of all this is a pve game if it was a pvp yeah that would be a broken ability to have second there are other characters that have unique talents or mechanics that give quality of life improvements in the game acherons technique being able to delete mobs without entering a fight fireflys technique being able to easily delete the pigs for that mini game in the simulated universe ruan meis also has a bonus in su topaz or hertas that can locate chests you get the point third even if you revive you have to be healed or shielded asap otherwise the character will die and if you die in this game then you should consider rework your team or tweak the builds of your characters not saying is a skill issue at all but if i die in a battle i often restart and try another approach,NEGATIVE,0.9964883327484131,0
would yall stop grifting on the global passive its not a big deal ffs,NEGATIVE,0.9989917874336243,0
the unique passive is not that much of game breaker unless you have some very speed tuned healers which i guess hyacine will be but thats up for air it happened to me several times on du and opponents are so fast that the revived party member dies again immediately and it only happened once per battle in long term boss raids it could be clutch but considering they also upped the speed of enemies plus most of them doing stray aoe attacks yeah the usefulness just drops significantly i guess it was actually busted before with multiple usage per battle and a hefty sum of hp once revived but was super nerfted from the beta experience backlash im not defending it its still an awful system im just saying that people are getting too riled up over it unless they make another one that heals a party member on very critical hpin conjunction with this now thats when we really get mad,NEGATIVE,0.9992921352386475,0

once you obtain this character when therere enemies with hp their hp will be depleted entirely this skill is active even if the character isnt in the party after obtaining this character when teammates energy needs were nine or less to reach max energy this character will provide the needs so they have full energy this skill is active even if the character isnt in the party,POSITIVE,0.9148876070976257,1

no we are not lucky that the first set of global passive is in a wanted character hoyo only made castorice have the first global passive because they knew they could get away with it castorice was beloved everyone wanted her anniversary refreshed the shop and gave motives for people to waste more money so ofc this month will be their biggest revenue ever in hsr story which basically means they can add global passives without any trouble because they did it first and it sold greatly,POSITIVE,0.9391031265258789,1
we all know this isnt going to kill the game we all know this will sell well we all know this will only get worse we all know people will continue playing they are going so hard on her in just about everything from animation release window power and how many ui animations that she is a first for and honestly i think its because they kinda know this game just has its looks going for it at this point as gameplay is so stupid simple that if it didnt look good people wouldnt care anymore so they went all out with her because its all she actually has that will last nothing she does even her global passive will last because she will be replaced by hoyo themselves soon enough,NEGATIVE,0.999322772026062,0

im sorry but i cant take this video seriously when your sponsor is ld shop a top up website for gacha games this whole controversy is so wildly overblown and i cant help but not care anymore when so many content creators are trying to make it some kind of moral obligation to skip castorice its just a game if you dont like whats going on seriously just quit and play a different game criticism is fine but this topic has already been completely beaten to death and now its just annoying they added the passive its in the game its not going away the best thing players can do is put their dissatisfaction in the surveys at this point and hope that hoyoverse sees the backlash from there,NEGATIVE,0.9996137022972107,0
what sucks is that castorice has a genuinely good kit design i love the dragon animations and her playstyle is really interesting and has its own pretty intersting decision making and planning but whos to say she will still be relevant a year from now i still got a good amount saved for phainon and the fate collab and that will probably be the last chance to keep me invested in the game especially with endfield most likely releasing this year a game im really hyped for and hsr is the game i would drop to make time to play it i can see an argument that the global passive keeps her relevant even after she is powercrept but i dont want my future characters to get reduced to a passive after a couple versions,NEGATIVE,0.9768313765525818,0
this is basically the optimus prime question from transformers freedom is your right if you make that request we will honor it but before your president decides please ask him this what if we leave and your wrong basically no one has a problem with castorice global passive for now because everyone wants castorice but what happens when they bring out a character no one wants but they have a broken passive that you need to have or else your cooked,NEGATIVE,0.9891766905784607,0
is intresting that so many ppl have different options about her i mean i pulled her and dont even noticed the passive that much and before i was doing all content without her and the op characters only with characters i got from pulls and does are what ppl say are weak i mean i use gepard and he does his job good as well bronja and houhou and mydei and he does auto battle what is fine for me i mean yes the passive is not a good idea i know but when you dont like the passive dont pull her i pull her bc i dont really care about the passive that much my most run team is mydei gepard bronya and houhou what is intresting i mean i can beat most endgame content and i am free to play since i start playing honkai star rail,NEGATIVE,0.9938938021659851,0

people seem to forget that theyve been breezing through end game content with just playing auto and not thinking now people are actually have to think how to full clear moc the endgame mode is designed to cater to new character this is not something new ive struggled with recent end game content and i racked my brain to full clear it i do want a good challenge but this seems almost impossible as for future global passives i think its best to tone it down thats not ground breaking and make it so you can only select one global passive ensuring that castorice doesnt get the only special treatment and fair for future character global passives gacha games are inherently predatory this is no surprise pull for whoever you like not what the meta dictates there is no future proof characters hoyo does need to tone down the recent moc as the rewards doesnt match the difficulty of the challenges even with new units it is still hard to clear them the only thing we can do as a community is to give feedback such as what ive provided earlier pull for whoever you like and dont let anyone judge you for doing so dont feel guilty for not getting the character you wanted and spend your money and pulls wisely,NEGATIVE,0.9990664124488831,0
this is a turnbased game theres only so much they can do i expected global passives or something similar to have been came in the game meta cost money if you are unlucky just play the game again this is a turnbased game you cant do much anyways other than attack on your turn wait to be attacked activate a ultimate and have a followup mechanic they need to add something else,NEGATIVE,0.9990589022636414,0

barasmin yup its alright you can retry that and take the advice in mind ive seen too many people blame that everything in hsr is hard now because of the hp inflation but keep in mind this hp inflation only affects old enemies like svarog and the propagation bug that usually shows in moc while the newer enemies always has some type of mechanic to justify their hp increase like nikador and this recent flame reaver where both has special mechanics to kill them quickly,NEGATIVE,0.9959480166435242,0

barasmin hey i just want to put in my advice as well but it is going to be a bit more general since someone already helped with the reaver fight which i will say does require you to only do aoe attacks when his shadows are up never when hes alone if you need skill points this is the best time to do basics i cleared this moc with st acheron es jq es pela fu xuan es nd firefly es ruan mei es hmc s dd lingsha es this was the first moc where i was truly stuck because i didnt have the correct characters until i completed my acheron team with jq one thing i will say is that mydei sustainless is completely viable in this moc you can replace luocha with remembrance mc and youll see a major difference and i am not exaggerating if you want the sustain replace robin and put her in the first half probably replacing jade for the classic robinsunday combo also dont be afraid to look on youtube for jing yuan clears especially for the reaver because even though this game can be a character check sometimes you have to check your stats and your gameplay first before finally saying this moc is hard trust me i tried many teams before settling for this see other peoples jing yuan stats which are shown in most videos sure some of them has tribbie but sundayrobin can suffice good luck if you havent already completed it,NEGATIVE,0.9895159006118774,0

theyre pretty much adding a new rarity to the game characters with global passives should be considered as for all intent and purposes i remember they did something similar in another gacha i played magia record they added special units that had passive skills that could affect your entire team something never seen before it just ruined the game completely and eventually you had to have all the characters with these passives if you wanted to clear the hardest content not to mention pvp but at least they were limited to being used while they were in the party this is just so much worse i can imagine the state of the game in a couple years there will be so many global passives stacking up on top of each other that your account pretty much has cr er spd break efficiency etc and new players wont be able to clear moc stage because of how many characters youll need to deal with the monstrous hp of everything this is not the end its the beginning of the end,NEGATIVE,0.999768078327179,0

in honkai impact there was a similar system where you would get a global stat increase based on if you had a certain star weapon or not however you didnt have to pull for some of these weapons and could earn them through playing also their global passives were not as game changing as cheating death rather you would gain more hp atk or crit rate,NEGATIVE,0.9970249533653259,0

you are a little late to the doomposting party the passive itself its not important it doesnt really change your gameplay if you dont have a sustain ready you revived char is gonna die again one moment after and those sustainless comps only work when your team is hyper invested from the get go for example e s plus supps also similarly invested mostly cycle clears maybe it can help if you get unlucky at the last second and all enemies decide to target tingyun at their last turn but in any case if you are whaling like that you are already playing a different game that the rest of folk the precedentslippery slope argument is fearmongering its just a what if what if they do something bad in the future well if they do we can complain at that time no need to get hysterical now i woulda prefer they didnt add this passive just so i didnt have to hear the moanings of a vocal reddit minority fueled by content creators for over a month,NEGATIVE,0.999444305896759,0

i find this just a bit sad i havent been keeping up with star rail but the story and the turn based combat is something that i have been feeling like returning to and when i want to return i start hearing about global buffs hidden behind pay walls making the game even less accessible to a free to play player like me my teams are already super dated and even if some characters i have get buffed i just feel like i couldnt keep up so when i already had problems in penaconi with my teams then i just dont think its worth the effort to get back into it honestly really sad since i was really enjoying the story when i was playing,NEGATIVE,0.9992461204528809,0
crit is a horrible example think more in line of hi it would probably be atk or hp its not good but hi has been this way with even worse powercreep for years this is a honkai game after all,NEGATIVE,0.9994631409645081,0
what i find mildly hilarious about the global passive is that it also just doesnt work out in your favor sometimesjust doesnt matter practically all relevant enemies do more than one action during their turn anyway be it fua or just flat out doing more damaging actions in a turn that even if a team member dies and gets revived theyll still be killed anyway because you have no way to survive or even interact with multiple attacks like that and you just end up dying anyway i know this cause it happened when i tried moc after getting castorice things just attack way to much and way too hard now that its become an arms race of scaling damage mechanics and overall bloat to the game where therere just way too many things to keep track of and surviving this shit is just too much to ask sometimes,NEGATIVE,0.9984055161476135,0
unfortunately castorice is going to easily make over million between the top up reset the spending event insane character animations global passive and the general excitement for anniversary patches shareholders are going to see that and say yeah you need to do that again regardless if its bad for the games health the sales are the only thing that matters and they made certain it was going to be a crazy revenue spike,NEGATIVE,0.9988858103752136,0
my true problem with global passives is not only the problems it can give to hsr but also to the gacha industry as a whole we all know that modern gacha games tend to have some mayor inspiration from hoyoverse as a whole for both the better and the worse so if they see this passive being successful we may see it in other games kuro games is a great example since their very beginning they have been taking some heavy notes from hoyo as a whole what will happend to wuwa once they implement global passives or worse their future hsr version you can also come to the argument that that wont be the case because kuro is hoyo but better so that wont happen argument and i wont debate whenever or not thats true because thats not the point point is what will happen to other gacha games that look at this ananta neverness to everness black beacon azur promilia my only hope is that future gacha devs will either see this and not try it or that the chinese government puts some sort of law that prohibits this kind of passives and before you say anything yes im inhaling copium for this,NEGATIVE,0.9878814220428467,0
i always suspected star rail could go this way because most gacha games do sth to a similar vein create an exclusive skillpassive or just make the char a must pull anchor by making them ridiculously op its such a major problem bcz its a hoyo game,NEGATIVE,0.9980306029319763,0

this is unfortunately very much true however as nihilistic as sounds that they will just global passive the game to death if we as a fanbase that cares for the longevity of the game go to the feedback page and flood their systems with disapproval yes theyll listen to the numbers that she sold millions because she will sell but if you wish to see this game last well into years do not spend on her banner now and instead not spend all of anniversary or spend it all on anaxagoras or the rerun banners on top of the feedback it is the only way that even something remotely will be moved at all because casuals will not give a shit,NEGATIVE,0.9979602098464966,0

blehbeh it is and it should be theres a reason why gacha games rightfully get called trash and its because of things like that reason why genshin was such a massive success was because it made sure that never happens it doesnt matter how good your graphics or gameplay is if people constantly feel the need to use the hot new thing in order to enjoy parts of the game and if hoyo wanted players to spend more then they should improve their character is more either through stroy fun or marketing people dont whale in these games because of meta reasons its purely because they like the character that much,NEGATIVE,0.9973931312561035,0
no thats not true ive known many people that did not care for characters and only pulled for meta to build the strongest team so to say and u say that it should be but it isnt there is patches that bring new content u play the patch and then quit or you login every day until the next content drops thats gacha games at its core if you want a game that u can play thats not gacha games and people need to understand that hoyo also doesnt care that much because people keep buying their characters no matter what anyway look at pokemon for example they have huge numbers even though the games are laggybad graphics hoyo is in the same boat because there isnt a lot of competition this has gotten better ofc bcs of wuwa etc but not perfect yet,NEGATIVE,0.9992352724075317,0
blehbeh people who care about the meta are in the minority and people who pull purely based off of meta are an even smaller minority the only time the wider community cares about meta is when it becomes a problem that effects their gameplay experience like powercreep or a character being too powerful otherwise they just pull for the characters they like and those players should still be able to enjoy the entire game without having to be meta slave and adding things like global passives makes that harder and harder to do each time a new passive gets added,NEGATIVE,0.9980781078338623,0
grimsdol no u are again thinking a gacha game is like a normal game its not and ppl need to stop fooling themselves bcs of it gacha games will be harder to beat esp end game contentmodes if you do not pull for objectivly good characters thats why there is challenge accounts to begin with star only fp only etc im not saying global passives are good im saying they simply do not affect me and probably a majority of the fanbase that doesnt even cleartouch moc for example and that at the end of the day we should just pull for the chars we want bcs they make us play the game and if we cant clear content the highest tiers of end game content bcs of that then thats fine with me whales will have incentive to pull and look cool and the game will keep going steadily,NEGATIVE,0.9938761591911316,0
blehbeh why not think a gacha game especially a hoyo game is like other games people who actively try not to have things be compared to each other are people being disingenuous hsr and gacha games as whole are still games and they should be fun and fair making it so you need you cant use the characters you want and instead have to use your precious money or pulls on the best characters whether you like them or not isnt fun and if your answer is thats how gacha games are then guess what those games are trash theyre not good games the reason why genshin and hoyoverse as whole was such a massive success is because it made sure not to fall into the same pitfalls as other gachas,NEGATIVE,0.610541045665741,0
grimsdol sure you are right to a certain extent however at the end of the day hoyo games are still gacha games and no matter how fair they still use the same practices denying that and saying they are still games they should be fun and fair is like turning a blind eye towards how gacha games function they profit off of fomo and they do anything to make you spend money this is why moc changes favorably towards newer characters and is why we have different meta over the span of years esp with star rail you notice this with powercreep and now ofc global cooldowns genshin and star rail and zz operate the same way daily login weeklies different in game quests events etc these games are not comparable to for example monster hunter world where you buy the gameexpansion and then are able to grind and complete everything within the game without having to spend more money on armorweapons which is their equivulant of chars i suppose gacha games are free and they need to earn money too free games usually have skins fortnite cod etc and gacha games have characters also sometimes skins my answer to why not a gacha games is that they are free and need to make money they earn their majority money from whales this is a known fact with gacha games and that means they will always need to give whales that powerful feeling hence the moc catering to newer characters harder content for fplow spenders its how these games work and thats why i dont even try to compete with them i just have fun with the characters i want and plan accordingly every patch i also have accounts so i am able to get the characters i want gacha games give you the illusion u can play for free by having to invest a huge amount of time because time money and time invested more incentive to spend money you should not forget that all games but especially gacha games are made to make money,NEGATIVE,0.9935249090194702,0
blehbeh theres always an acceptable limit and its important to create one the argument that they have to make money can be used to excuse any scummy way of marketing or monetization hey why is this is this game well they gotta make money somehow,NEGATIVE,0.995964765548706,0
yes but that is gacha games at its core yes ofc game prices need to be realistic but gacha games specifically reward whales by having better characters when they spend money thats their whole business model and why the game is free and why they give more free pulls towards the beginning of the game its a known tactic to get you hooked thats why i keep saying gacha games are different and why when we play them we should keep that in mind,NEGATIVE,0.921055018901825,0
blehbeh hsr has hundreds of millions of dollars in budget and makes just as much it does not need to do this in order to keep afloat and idk any whales who arent selfish idiots who asked for global passives on star characters,POSITIVE,0.9917705059051514,1
they didnt ask for it but it doesnt bother them because they will always get them anyway also they earn way more than they spend thats just normal business practice that every company does again gacha games just work like this no matter the company the sooner you realize that the sooner u can start planning and have fun on ur own terms,NEGATIVE,0.8935604691505432,0
blehbeh global passives on limited characters are not the norm in gachas and being complacent with yummy practices that dont improve the game in anyway is how games die,NEGATIVE,0.9997108578681946,0
grimsdol they might not be the norm but that doesnt change how gachas work if anything they are trying to create more fomo for more money yes i agree its how games die and the game might lose players for that i dont think i would have introduced a global passive if i was in charge and i dont think its a good decision however it does not affect me because i am not a whale and i am not clearing all of the hardest content every patch anyway if the storyevents however start to become too hard to the point where u have to rely on new characters to clear it then i think it will have gone too far,NEGATIVE,0.9991140961647034,0
blehbeh how is the game losing players not harmful to you if the game had less players then that means less content will be made because theres not enough players and income to sustain it even if all the players who leave are fp thats still bad as a big budget game with a low population is still bad and whales arent going to spend on a game that has less and less players and content,NEGATIVE,0.9994872808456421,0
i think its to early to judge how powerful the become in the future this one was for testing the waters with players how they react to it and how good she will sell the next global passive that comes is pretty much the make or break part ive it staiys at this smaller power scale then will its still shit you dont brick your account ive you dont pull that charakter but ive they decide to put stats or action advance on it then it becommes an even bigger problem,NEGATIVE,0.9978861212730408,0

heavily disagree a global passive granting any sort of combat advantage is several times more staggering than the slight off chance that castorices revive granting your aglaea one extra turn earning you a clear while gps are bad for sure castorices gp in specific is not strong at all like even a crit damage global passive is way worse than what castorice has,NEGATIVE,0.9993866682052612,0

are we seriously still on about this heres a stunt im going to not watch the video and see if i can still nail the content let me know how i did part castorice and her global passive are briefly introduced part an explanation of what a global passive is part the potential pitfalls of global passives long term part agonized handwringing over whether or not we trust hoyo to not monetize a mechanic spoiler alert we dont part the rather odd assertion that the players who arent quitting right now are too stupid to understand any of the above points part defensive dismissal of possible counterarguments part the disingenuous argument that any nice thing introduced to hsr from now on is part of a cynical effort to distract the fans rather than address the underlying issues part connect to the wider power creep issue avoid at all costs explaining how these issues arent baked into the gacha format part wrap up by asking for engagement in the comments ive been seeing this video in some form or another for months and they all every last one of them follow this pattern,NEGATIVE,0.9994200468063354,0
doesnt the passive require a sustain i know castorice can heal in some way but not that quickly so even if she has that passive you still need a healer or a shielder to not lose that second life,NEGATIVE,0.6927337050437927,0

on top of the entire controversy and major power scaling issue just like mauvika i want to play the character not a bike or a dragon i dont understand their design focus and thank goodness she doesnt appeal to me so its an easy skip whereas i understand how so many are tempted by the supposed meta with how they are continuing its killed any interest in continuing to invest as its proven it makes dedication pointless or quickly overcome basically in a few patches hope theyll redirect and correct before they continue going down this path too long,NEGATIVE,0.9986202716827393,0

how bad global passive is entirely dependent on how much faith you have in hoyo balancing global passives if all passives are practically pointless and have a set limit then the game will live but if youre like me you have no faith in hoyo and fully expect them to powercreep global passives and make them a must have or struggle and have linit on how many can be active,NEGATIVE,0.9980819225311279,0

zennir new mechanics revive is new mechanics on hsr or its the global passive you are talking about if yes then that not a very good one one mechanics they can do that is not as bad as being global passive is just make it team wide passiveno activation required just meeting certain requirements an example would be similar to march hunt has but team wide not just for herself hp increase for the team the unity with that passive and not something that will take effect just from having them even in team the unit is not part of,NEGATIVE,0.9943391680717468,0
zennir ive been telling people that this global passive is a special thing that literally only reserved for a special anniversary characters like last year we got acheron that has a technique that is still the only one that is able to kill mobs instantly castorices revive isnt really that good either man these small percentage of the total population quite literally freaked out because of all of these what ifs lmao i dabbled in leaks still to this day theres no datamined information about gp other than castorices,NEGATIVE,0.9972580671310425,0

there is only one thing ill give to hoyo shills and its that this specific passive is pretty bad but that is also a problem the fact that it is a crutch passive that only activates if you do poorly is why its easy to dismiss any legitimate problems people might have with passives as a whole i predict that couple patches from now community will be crying about dogshit state of balance that no one can explain how it even came to being all the while every other unit will be giving some unique passive that all end game content requires you to have to beat it but then again some people are still denying that powercreep exist so maybe itll be more than few patches from now,NEGATIVE,0.9992145299911499,0

extra irony they had a dorm system and a farmable divine key system in honkai impact rd which served as damage bonuses sp recovery and so on too bad they made it further greedy by needing to chase older s rank gacha units to double s or get two divine keys of the same category to get level two versions of stronger damage and sp recovery which made small enough differences to reach minor thresholds for loops and so on which further got worst when signature gear in honkai rd often would give one or more instance of massive bonus sp and sometimes switch cooldown reduction to make them skip one or more rotations out of time sinking heavy crap if you remember the flamechaserss eden character in hird and pardofelis then you know why that crap was beyond broken,NEGATIVE,0.9996471405029297,0
it isnt even that strong of a global passive it revives them with hp and they need to be healed even if they are shielded or theyll die well if you are running a preservation comp her passive is already useless because you have no healers sometimes you will die resurrect into hp and it happens instantly so the enemy just smacks you dead again its not really op enough to change meta,NEGATIVE,0.9996485710144043,0

escapetherace and apparently people ignoring the boogers on the wall again even if they were to die immediately after thar next turn from being revived from it thats essentially bloodzerg gimmick where they do one last grenade charge to do an impact which is fantastic for some tactics to cheese out one more last valueage being able to use it to straight up ignore a oneshot mechanic that has such an absurdly high ceiling to clear can enable people to just let the death happen revive after it pop an ultimate or some special reaction effect and they effectively got a free get out of jail free card to ignore a mechanic and now have rotations to obliterate the boss instead of when that mechanic shows up the first time they introduced an entire ui for it they are gonna straight up add way more of these global passives and like priarms in hird did and fatui harbingers were like in genshite they will make it the most cancerous thing ever which ps they are totally not gonna put a limit on how many you have out because then that would limit how much fomo they can cram into players to spend on as many global passive units ultimately though it sets up multiple factors between exploitation of a gimmick flip off newer players who were not around when this character was available and suffer and praying for them to return but its always put on another super awesome chars banner because hoyoverse reruns suck in general and of course now hoyoverse is gonna ramp up the power escalation even harder by having the justification of people can now have access to a bailu endure that also flips off preservation shieldstacking nuts by demanding a heal to make it fully like a baihu revive except it can apply to more then just a single person basically and just a reminder they dont even need the global passives to be on good units in particular they could straight up make some of the character buffs make characters like silverwolf kafka or blade also have global passives to further the bs on newer players who now have to chase super old dated characters regardless of how much they been buffed and will make it even harder to deal with chasing new chars vs chasing reruns because of global passive editions which you can imagine them purposely releasing hook level of trash characters that just get some super special global passive like a permanent weakness dmg bonus or a shield at the start of combat or increase to healing value would sound so small but then it can not only stack up but maybe even synergize into extra bs hell imagine the introduction of a global passive that gives hp regen or life steal to the entire party that would straight up be some bs hoyoverse would shove out and conviently fix the problem of cast of rices global passive thus demanding people have to pull on limited characters for a broken sell you the problem charge extra for a solution months later level of bs,NEGATIVE,0.9975292086601257,0

like many people have said her revive isnt the issue the addition of global passives in general is with the way hsr handles difficulty aka hp inflation and hyperspecific gimmicks designed to make you wanna pull whatever shiny new units theyve just released global passives just add another avenue for them to make combat more playerhostile than playerfriendly down the line we might get for example a character that turns all excess crit rate into crit dmg for every character in your account sounds neat right only sucks for people who dont want that unit in particular but then that same update they release a boss who only takes damage if your character crits essentially making that character as close to mandatory as possible for whatever endgame content that boss appears in unless youre masochistic enough to play the losing game known as relic minmaxing,NEGATIVE,0.9988424181938171,0

thejh i dont think you get what i mean in my last comment all the endgame modes like to heavily favor the newest star character to make them feel like the best character in the game thats how the games baits you into thinking the newest character is a must pull example being when ruan mei released the moc buff was weakness break as much enemies as possible to do massive damage when acheron released the moc buff was every character can debuff an enemy so she can spam her ultimate faster when ratio released the moc buff was every enemy gets debuff on a new cycle and so on,POSITIVE,0.9864550828933716,1

well if you dont pull for her you dont get the passive its pretty simple i dont get how hard it is for people to understand that you have to have the character for it to work and you think theyre just gonna give it out as a trait its all about making money and at the end of the day if they give you another reason why you want to pull a character or pay for a character theyre going to do that because thats how developers work with most of todays games try to make pw as possible nobody needs to pull her its just that if you dont have her you cant use the passive pretty simple lets say she didnt have the global passive so if thats the case how much do you think people are going to pay for her,NEGATIVE,0.9981667995452881,0

people will always find something to complain about whether its character designs character kits synergy etc i just pull whoever im interested in and play around with different teams until something clicks if characters are built well then they generally wont die unless youre fighting something thatll hit multiple times in a row before you can move and even then you can toss in bailu and get a res that way its definitely a huge thing to have but if youre dying to stuff then a time revive that leaves you on hp wont be gamebreaking,NEGATIVE,0.9870676398277283,0

global passive and the people disliking it are already making assumptions its understandable that this might bring a new model into the game even changing late game to punish those that didnt pull and creates fear for the future but we have to see how it is made first but seems like no people have to judge way before hand now that she is out people is still mad clearly many people arent happy about this and i mean many arent so devs could listen but then i just want to ask one question you are complaining about powercreep now so acheron wasnt powercreep lunae wasnt either aventurine who is he again well cas is also you can complain about this ok sure but i want to remind everyone that completing everything like moc as and pf arent obligatory at all they give many jades sure but like you tried to do it and reach your real limit doesnt have to be everything just what you can is it hard well what tf you expected everything in a silver plate its hoyo many gachas have this and this feature could potentially be a test from them who knows we all know hoyo dosent share info what so ever on their plans plus who the tf said you cant complain and you have to pull for cas personally i think there are still reasons to play the game whether its story the characters or even the endgame and events i think castorices gp is the most controversial thing so far at least from what i have seen i just wish people remembered why they started playing the game and if they are really sure giving up everything for one singular fckg thing im not saying they should stay im saying is it worth the drama mind blowing srry for the long ahh text,NEGATIVE,0.994766116142273,0

this is so fucking wrong the problem is global utility locked behind gacha these kind of content farmer is part of the reason why hsr community stays dumb i doesnt matter who it is and what it is global utility never got locked behind gacha in this type of game global utility itself is not unheard of but before hsr theyre locked behind resources that anyone can farm these are usually really really late game grind and rarely game changing meanwhile castorice gp is absurdly strong for a gp for references usually gp only give you maybe bonus to stat after long long grind unless youre dumb as rock this much info should be enough to make you realize how bad it can be if gp gacha become the norm now why do i care because as much as i hate it hoyo is basically apple of gacha game right now meaning theyre the litmus test of what kind of shitty move they can get away of before others followed suit gacha locked global passive in hsr is a small problem but if it become common in industry now its huge problem,NEGATIVE,0.9993733763694763,0

i support castorice passive since the game already has too much hp inflation and fp cant even finish floor moc without too much farming and the bosses have high dmg and speed which gives them many chances to kill you plus ppl need to have speed boots on all their characters to keep up with the bosses and will lower their attack because of it,NEGATIVE,0.9966500401496887,0

this passive isnt even going to be much of an effect if you need the passive to do any form of content im pretty sure you have bigger problems and yes it sets a bad precedent future passives may be even worst but thats for the future enjoy what you have now instead of worrying about a future possibility and if you quit because of this good you simply wanted to quit for a long time and didnt have a big spark to make it happen,NEGATIVE,0.7552549242973328,0

were upset cause even if u think this passive doesnt bust the game it absolutely does theirs the fact that little things pile up over time into big things now its just a revive mechanic but tmrw its gonna be crit dmg if you pull this support unit then its gonna be crit rate on ultimates now you cant even beat moc cause the bosses have been hp inflated to account for dps units with crit rate crit damage this ruins the game this isnt fun,NEGATIVE,0.9994494318962097,0

the funniest part to me watching all of this controversy around castorices global passive is the people saying that global passives are going to be must pull characters when in reality theres absolutely no basis or reasoning that supports this there might be if the game had any kind of competitive nature like pvp or leaderboards but its doesnt youre not competing with anyone no one else who has global passives is going to affect your gameplay and i guarantee that you will not fall behind in moc or any of the endgame modes in the long run if you skip castorice for a future character or any other global passive characters that follow stop comparing yourself to other peoples accounts and play the game for fun if you want to use the character pull them and if you dont then dont it really is that simple,NEGATIVE,0.9003251194953918,0
it might work lore wise but this means that hoyo will make more specific skill characters you must pull for and since they lock some important stats you need for a character to function properly behind eidolons this will get even worse with specific characters you need to pull its the greedy practices that hoyo is adding to the game which is the issue,NEGATIVE,0.9983910918235779,0

the thing is her passive wouldnt allow you to do endgame content any easier as you think she doesnt revive you permanently so you need to heal them or give them shield or the character would still be downed theres a butterfly icon beside the character health bar this mean that you cant even run a sustainless team comp at all unless your blade who can heal your self or mydei with his ultimate its not as broken as people think its pretty balance for a global passive because it doesnt allow you to run a crazy sustainless run without a worry it doesnt effect the damage of your character because its not a buff towards damage this doesnt make her a must must pull rather supports like jq is far more valuable than her and is a even more must pull than her you dont necessarily need her passive what you need to fix or help your account is proper invested supports invest in them thats what will help you clear end game content not just casto anyways thats my personal opinion i dont like whats coming for the future but i also dont hate her since shes not as broken as people may make her seems to be,NEGATIVE,0.9624613523483276,0

youre blaming global passives for a problem they didnt cause castorices passive boosts survival not damage it doesnt contribute to hp bloat at all your claim just doesnt hold up assuming the devs will abuse global passives for monetization is pure speculation focus on whats actually broken not what you think might happen game development is a gradual process if future global passives do include offensive utility thats a balance issue not proof of malicious intent enemy hp inflation is real global passives arent the problem theyre just support tools that got better,NEGATIVE,0.9974424839019775,0
youre talking about monetization and malicious intent when i never talked about it im just telling that now that global passive exist they will inevitably make some at some point that increase your damage output and most likely not just once and of course these global passive will be taken into account for the hp scalling and the player that did not get the character with said global passive wont just be able to summon the new character to have the perfect dmg output to go against the hp scalling since theyll have missed a certain amount of damage scalling global passive also i know global passive didnt create the hp scalling problem but they will make it worst except if the dev decide to not take global passive dmg up when making the hp scalling but its more of a dream than what will happen,NEGATIVE,0.9992722868919373,0
you surely didnt mention monetization but i did because that was my original point pw is driven by hp inflation not global passives then you say you didnt mention malicious intent but youre literally assuming future global passives will boost damage assuming devs will scale hp around them and assuming that players who skip them will be permanently behind zero evidence pure speculation that is implying malicious intent just with extra steps thats like saying im not accusing the school of scamming kids i just know they might eventually make calculators mandatory and then might as well start selling overpriced calculators and the kids who dont buy them will probably fail math so we better blame them now before that happens global passives existing doesnt guarantee theyll boost damage or be used to justify hp inflation thats a textbook slippery slope yes we should call out bad balancing when it happens but until a global passive actually breaks hp scaling youre blaming the rain before theres even a cloud crying wolf over what might happen only derails real discussion,NEGATIVE,0.9994650483131409,0

just so you understand the complain about the her global passive well first its not about the effect because its kinda ass if a character just revive with hp then everything can kill it immediatly after so it could be usefull but it most likely wont the problem is the idea of a character buffing your team even when its not in your team for now its not a big deal because the effect is bad but when a character will come out with a global passive that add attack or crit chance or crit damage or anything that help do more damage then itll be a bigger problem and if you still dont see the problem then think about multiple global passive of that caliber stacking and how the devs will try to balance monster hp and then realise that most people wont have all of them and the hp scalling will be impossible to go through if you dont put money in the game or even if you put just a little bit of money but not enough,NEGATIVE,0.9995859265327454,0
siphons i am aware of all that you are saying and the fact that people are mad about the idea of the global passive but thats not what im trying to convey if you read all of the message i said that when the hoyo com wanted more banners for their favorite characters hoyo included multiple banners of characters for multiple versions for the com to pull and some of you still complained about it in simple terms if you dont like whats going on in the game just simply quit if you dont like what theyre making or you deal with whats going on thats the only options im seeing but at the end of the day your still playing the game arent you and obviously they arent changing it and its already confirmed no use in complaining about it anymore plus you can still play the game and clear endgame rewards without her,NEGATIVE,0.9993545413017273,0
mistaplayssd for your first point yes i did thats why i specifically said the complain about her global passive not why people complain in general also people are allowed to be annoyed and express the thing that they find annoying not that i understand it for the multiple banners but dont except people to not complain for your second point people like a game for its entirety not just the gameplay and thats the same thing for star rail people partly like it for the gameplay yes but also for the characters the story the worldbuilding the scenery so yes people wont just stop playing because of a thing that is getting sligtly worsthas the potential on becoming a problem however they might do if the hp scalling become such a problem that the fight become more frustrating than anything and the idea of global passive can and will surely worsen the hp scalling problem and they wont stop feeling relieved or happy but sad that they cant keep experiencing all the other part of the game that they still love because of the gameplay if you want me to use an example that isnt game then lets take food think of your favorite food or at least one of your favorite food imagine then than in the near future an ingredient needed and cant be replaced for said food start to become more and more expensive even with that price being bigger and bigger youll still want to eat that food since its one you love however you wont be able to eat it as much as you want until one day the ingredient is too expensive for you to buy at that point youll have to stop eating that favorite food and you will feel sad that you might never be able to reexperience such a great food ever again now lets replace the ingredient by the fights in star rail the price by the frustation given to you by the game and the love by the enjoyment given to you by the game do you understand a bit better why people complain and not just stop playing also i dont know where to put that but you said at the end you can still play the game and clear endgame rewards without her and i answer to you that the problem is not her the problem is the potential bigger problem that will happen when new characters with a global passive will arrive and said passive upgrade damage of your characters and stacks with older ones and that is one thing i already said,NEGATIVE,0.9979541301727295,0
siphons okay i totally agree and understand what youre saying but like hoyo gon do hoyo they dont really listen to the community that much anyway like they should they should also follow kuro games example like if you play wuwa then yk how kuro do but anyways im prob still gonna pull for her bc i love her animations and designs soyeaand i also think hsr players are mostly likely to boycott the banner cus of the global but if you really think about it like you said it is ass but thanks for explaining i was just being stupid forgive me for my ignorance,NEGATIVE,0.7061769366264343,0
mistaplayssd boycotting wont do anything i saw some people in that comment section say that there were leaks with other character with global passive so boycotting would amount to nothing and even if it could the amount of people that would entirely stop playing thats what boycotting is not just not pulling wouldnt be a lot compared to people that would keep playing because they either dont care or just dont follow news and just wait to be surprised pleasently by the game and im probably gonna do the same i prepared a team for her patch ago before i knew anything of her kit and i kinda dont want it to go to waste so yeah i like the character and its enough of a reason to pull,NEGATIVE,0.9443341493606567,0

realquarlie just speed tune better in sustainless comps or throw on any limited sustaingallagher and you beat the game with ease this might be a hot take but castorices passive is completely useless if youve been playing for long enough to have fully decked out teams consisting of at least a few recently released characters,NEGATIVE,0.999556839466095,0
bepo even with just a revive its really strong to have it as a global passive instead of relying on sustain you can now instead invest on pure damage a lot more it being a permanent upgrade for every team is too strong but moreso the bigger thing is the fact that this is just the developers testing the waters if we dont complain about it now they will add more global passives that may stretch even further what would you say when in a few months we get characters with global passives buffing atk or crit stats and the endgame slowly more and more relies on people having those global passives,NEGATIVE,0.9982653260231018,0
realquarlie i never claimed to think global passives were a good idea infact ill come out and say it right now global passives will be the death of the game at this rate my entire point is that the revive itself is pretty useless for veterans or those with enough game knowledge i can totally see hoyo adding res pen and def shred as global passives or god forbid locking them behind eidolons,NEGATIVE,0.9998047947883606,0

the problem people are missing isnt the revive but the global passive itself its going to make power creep even worse cause old units wont have these passives and the buffed character arent going to be getting them plus will the buffed older units be at the level of castorice or future dpssupports no definitely not cause the company wants to make money on the new character the glibal passives will get better over time and knowing hyv they will probably be giving stat boosts like crit and speed in the future making characters a must pull even if u arent building their archetype dot fua etc and this potentially leads to creating characters with bad kits but their global passives are a must ir ur account isnt performing at the max dmg potential its a predatory practice you ethier have to save reasources and u get like pull per patch or spend dollars to get a not including the its a clear money grab and people defending this global passive and coping are part of the problem they dont see how predatory it is and how it leads to to worse things sure its not gonna happen right away but look at genshin in and it was fine but now its shit the traverse is locked behind characters like mauvika and ut inly works in natlan and dendro was so op it broke the game for a long time makjng dendro a must global passives should have been in a system where everyone could get it without the requirement of getting a character a lot of games do this even gacha games through some kind of level up system or upgrade system where you spend in game currency at after a certain teir or level up get the passive or a choice to choose a global passive,NEGATIVE,0.9993182420730591,0

listen im a whale not e everyone whale but eses most characters whale with an occassional e for the fav waifus typically eish for first banner then e on rerun my opinion on castorices gp its shit straight up if youre dying enough to need revives in this game you either have shit team builds major skill issues a fp that still hasnt used a majority of their pulls and is just running a bare minimum passing team or an autoplayer hsr is barely a difficult game and if you do end up dying cause of a skill issue you can easily just restart the fight all castorices gp does is save a bit of grinding time for the hp sponges for less well off accounts i dont have the best luck warp tracker says im top on pulls but im bottom on rate up luck and my relic luck is just as bad but i dont ever have anyone die unless im running auto if i have a skill issue cause im being stupid i just restart this gp is literally a nothing burger now do i think global passives are a good thing fuck no ive played tons of gacha games and the thing i hate most is fomo pw bs depending on what hyv does with gps it can go two ways they keep them as gimmickyvery very tiny buffs that wont change shitthink the room decorations for du that give x stat or whateveruseless most of the time abilities like castorice or they go balls to the wall with fomo pw ass buffs and kill off the majority of their playerbase that dont want any of that given the track record of hyv i do have a feeling theyll realize the backlash of having too op of gps so they wont go balls deep but majority of people sayong castorices gp is absolutely game breaking or whatever the fuck need to chill tldr revive mechanics in hsr is absolutely useless even in endgame content unless youre fp or have major skill issues i hope gp stays this useless but yall overreacting little babies,NEGATIVE,0.9992747902870178,0

i love castorice and i am so gonna es but the idea of global passives is a horrible idea people who like castorice are gonna be nah this is fine but if a character they dont wanna pull has an insane global passive that like idk increases every members crit rate by then what are you gonna do thats a mustpull cuz if you dont you have a massive disadvantage vs people who pulled the character its different from having someone like robin because shes just character that needs to be in a party but getting huge passives for just owning a character is ridiculous,NEGATIVE,0.9975084066390991,0

lets clarify why are we so worried about castorices global passive it open hells gate for even more powercreep the game allways plays around newer chars on its full potencial so what if it becomes a must have in future to even be able to complete end game content castorice will not be the only one with this kind of passive in the future we could start to see passives way more op than that like a healing every turn extra sp every turn permanent stat boosts or all characters advance action after each turn it seems pretty bad and skippable but those effects will stack so you will have sp healing and action advance passively every single turn without even having the characters in your party there is no such thing as exclusive to x character summons were exclusive to jim yuang elemental weakness forcing was exclusive to silver wolf different kind of ult charge was exclusive to acheron think about it,NEGATIVE,0.9974306225776672,0

lmao calling it as a cash grab but it is your own responsibility to be spending tbh i think it is unique mechanic in a turn based games like this it is not that powerful than what people think she can revive a charcater with hp which unless its your healers turn there is still risk especially facing with aoe attack enemies but the most concerning for this unique passive is the global stats buff for future characters i hope it is not that absurb that affects hsr overall gameplay,NEGATIVE,0.9958860278129578,0

it is not that it is broken this ability is never broken as in my opinion instead of wanting a revive mechanic how about not dying in the first place the real issue isnt the her global passive alone it is the implication in the future what if hoyo makes even more absurd and op global passive so until they either scrap this idea and remove it not doing this again or balance it so that it is not stupidly op this will be an issue for the future so for now we just have to wait and see,NEGATIVE,0.9900777339935303,0

i just wanna ask a question why not wait until this happen then there would be reason for anger castorices global passive is useless because the characters might die even after the revive theres no other additional effects other than the revive the revive is probably there because it connects to the whole kit of her taking away lots of allies hp if the devs make another character with a global assive they have to nerf something big from that character either way it might just be uniquely only for castorice like some other stars having their own unique thing even though global passives are pretty bad theres no proof that there would be any more of these in the future its just a possibility or a what ifs that hasnt been proven yet not even by early access players since thats a future we havent seen yet we can still say to the devs that future global assives will be bad for the game instead of saying that they dont listen and go on a rage or something if the future global passives does happen then the devs not listening would be justified why not cross that bridge when we get to it im not trying to make you mad im just wondering why not wait because the i told you so moment in the future is not really that concrete yet,NEGATIVE,0.9996097683906555,0
anonyshark because waiting and being okay with these types of features is already a form of consent by the time the i told you so moment happens its already too late and these devs wouldve already created multiple global passives in the pipeline and thats the exact shortsightedness i was referring to you said it yourself even though global passives are pretty bad letting them get away with one is contradicting your own statement and a clear sign that youre giving them consent to create more,NEGATIVE,0.9992117881774902,0
jamesnieves not unless someone does something about it with the amount of hate to global passives the ones who favor it or those that are okay with it will be overshadowed by people who dont like these assives since theres alot of us myself included im saying theres no guarantee for the devs to make more global passives if theres alot of people hating on it others can just put on surveys or on comments on the app that future global passives shouldnt be added in the future that would hopefully make the devs listen we should take action first before doing something too far like drama stuff sorry for misinterpreting that im okay with global passives because im not okay with it as well your point with it already being too late is true i shouldve thought of it before i just hope there arent game changing global passives in the future,NEGATIVE,0.9970223307609558,0

jamesnieves her passive does not break anything if you died once youll just die again you still have to be strong enough you can just surpass rng to a certain degree the real problem is it opens the gate for future characters to have also global passives that will give everyone crit dmg or like rsistancewich yes that would probably break the game,NEGATIVE,0.9972299933433533,0

remember people like this will always say no this is just chinese propaganda they just want you to spend all your money no they dont force you to spend any money in fact you can play these games without spending a dime but for some reason so many people just want to say oh no you have to spend money because theyre forcing you theyre not,NEGATIVE,0.9959192872047424,0

nobody cares about castorice revive people care about it being global if it would be in her kit while shes on the team nobody would care but it being global opens the door for future charackters and fomo imagine how hsr is in years when you dident get chars that have a global passiv like critrate or spd boost the powercreep is real if irc right the current base speed of trash monster is and they have x the base hp of monsters from the lofou ohh or imagine smth like a passiv that increases the loot you get from resinbased content global passivs hurts the game and anyone who denys it is someone who doesent care or doesent think longterm if anyone here thinks its good pls give me valid arguments for it cuz i cant see any unless you pay each month to get every char,NEGATIVE,0.9832474589347839,0

before i say anything imma just say we as a community are kinda fucking stupid we complain we beg hoyo for shit then when they do it or they do something healthy we keep bitching abt it acheron is too strong jiaoqiu is ass firefly is garbage now after the v nerf blah blah blah back around i thought it was kinda insane how much hoyo was freeballing it and now i realized why were too fucking unorganized every time the community has a good opinion another part shuts it down or just doesnt fully have an idea powercreep is rampant in hsr the powercreep is bad like yeah but what about other games ive played arknights ive played crk and all the other mobile gachas and tbh their powercreep is worst this powercreep will kill the game yeah but how the fuck are they supposed to fix that hoyo you racist how tou going to fix this shot you taken from a real review on the hsr review page on the apple store btw it was star xd as it would probably be said a lot of people complain but with those complaints dont give valid feedback on how to fix it just more screaming now while i play devils advocate there are good reviews i like this game but i wish that the content was easier while powercreep is good i wished it was not this powercreep this type of game design is toxic it will kill the game eventually now onto the main issue castorices global passive overall its kinda ass the passive is a lot like bailus revive but on every team as for why its the case mocs star conditions requires that a character doesnt get downed so if you have that happens your already screwed in addition since it only puts you on hp it causes dot to install kill and if healer is dead youre still screwed or sustainless its good for stuff like sustainless but even then means nothing its a qol more than anything just like acheron in the first anniversary now why is is so controversial well its a global passive which for anyone whos played games like this causes a skewing affect on the game tldr when you have something like this it boosts everything you have but in doing so has to make the endgame content harder it could easily go to other characters hoyo has had a good track record with hsr with limiting overall duplicate kits besides like clara and yunli also mydei and blade but if we have even more units like castorice with global buffs it could ruin the games difficulty and in turn fp status if we keep globals limited to limited characters and the game chooses to scale endgame on those characters then were just fucked lastly its also the fact of fp up till now nothing was required to be pulled just stuff that people wanted and what could be scrounged up to be used to star moc its still possibly with units if you dont believe me search up the star star mocs for the last couple of mocs global passives skewing the meta causes people who dont have them to pull because newer meta is impossible without them going into point different from that is that it now forces the players to have to pull to play something that puts a bad taste in peoples mouths if the game gets to a point where you cant clear something without pulling a character something that is either gate locked by currency which you have a limited amount and or is hard to obtain a lot to get or the character immediately after being obtained becomes dead once it gets to that point that is no longer playing a gacha game thats playing to give people your money in summary castorice isnt the problem its the pandoras box her kit opened in allowing global passives it opens a toxic door which could kill the game a lot like other gacha games best case is crk i loved that game before i realized how fucked up the games powercreep was months of grinding on old characters could be blitzed by a lvl super epic ancient cookie which requires to guarantee which became worst when you literally had a pvp v and they basically came out every month if the game chooses to embrace global passive its like walking on eggshells which could easily kill or flatline the game causing it to be too hard for newer players to join while bleeding its playercount what makes this worst is that the fanbase will keep complaining about it without doing shit so imma say it as a person who want this game to last longer than the weird cookie game communicate what the fuck is wrong people like i get most of the people here are kids but its not good that most reviews are just scream matches with imaginary hoyo devs which act like its good when it basically says nothing if the game dies it a mix of hoyo devs dying like the spongebob meme and a mix of us being dumbasses which enabled and allowed it im kept criticizing the game since somebody has to but either way lets see what the next year will hold but if the community dont hound the devs on this shit were fucked,NEGATIVE,0.9992202520370483,0

why do people make it sound like this is a first hasnt genshin been doing the same thing for years you literally have characters that halve the resource you need for certain things as long as they are in the account and that was fine now they make an incombat passive that noone will ever get to see and its a problem i dont particularly care about these stuff but the double standard is wild,NEGATIVE,0.996538519859314,0

i can see different opinions on this my personal opinion this game have been pw for a long time u need to pull specific char to clear the current end game contents easier and then the char will get powercreep patches later which is very quick n makes it hard for fp to play this game average hoyoshill reaction this is not a competitive game u can still enjoy the game even without having castorice so its fine ps people said that acheron is broken n it is too early for a char with that kit to be release during st anniv patches later she drop to t bet same thing will happen to castorice anyways the quick powercreep is why i quit i m now playing a gacha game that gives a healthier relationship so u can do whatever u want hoyo i dont care anymore,NEGATIVE,0.9983683228492737,0

why people are so worried about this just a question because i think its not kind of big problem if hsr was pvp then yeah i would understand but the game is only for one person and you play the way you want my biggest concern is not about powercreep cause it will always exist but about supporting old characters thats all just want to know what are people talking about,NEGATIVE,0.9581459164619446,0

castorices passive in theory is not really that broken especially if you know what youre doing but it does set the presedent that theyll come up with even more broken global passives hurting the game in the longterm thats what people are pissed off over and no amount of lore or bullshit will justify a blatant predatory practice like this,NEGATIVE,0.9970805048942566,0

i dont see this as bad cus this only does things either does nothing at conundrum where i take fatal damage and then still die later or i just win anyway without dying thing is honkai star rail is easy enough where to you shouldnt have problems clearing content till either a you get to high conundrums in sim uni or b you dont do enough damage to kill the bugs before they multiply again and as i said earlier its not a problem in sim uni cus i still die and the whole bug problem isnt a problem anyway since its not me dying thats the problem having said this i do think its weird that its active even when she isnt on the team but again i dont think its that big of a deal for the reasons i have stated,NEGATIVE,0.9950830936431885,0
the global passive itself isnt that broken the real problem lies in the fact that this sets a very dangerous precedent where even if youre not interested in a character you might still feel pressure to get them because simply by owning them all your roster gets a little stronger sure a global revive passive once per battle wont save you when you are completely outmatched but what if you also add increased healing to your team from a different characters global passive or debuff resistance or god forbid increased atk or increased spd what if on the other hand you just about missed on clearing endgame fights at the highest rating and having that global passive would have pushed you over the finish line,NEGATIVE,0.9970038533210754,0
one thing that bother me about castorice is that she is like a very picky macron because i heard her build is very picky and her lightcone none of the fp lightcone works nothing for her like oh crt lightcone its fine but she doesnt really need it or oh she needs this but not the other things include,NEGATIVE,0.9729762077331543,0

the universal passive itself isnt as bad as everyone makes it out to be since it can only be activated once per battle and puts your characters at hp so theyll probably get killed again anyways thats not the main issue the issue is that this opens doors for global passives that will eventually power creep this one i was never for it in the first place and will not be pulling for her i just hope hoyo will not make more characters like this in the future,NEGATIVE,0.9352431297302246,0

i saw one opinion from other cc saying that this passive is bad in the meaning that if a character dies your sustain is useless,NEGATIVE,0.9997562766075134,0
tbh the main issue is that its a global passive the effect itself is pretty trash like any other revive since it only works once per battle but it sets a precedent and if the slowly make more global passives and make them stronger than the last they would eventually have to balance the game around it forcing you to pull new characters,NEGATIVE,0.9984808564186096,0

it seems to me like an interesting feature different characters have different passives and skills it would be boring if all characters were the same it makes things more interesting i dont know if ill pull for castorice but why complain about a cool feature i see these kind of complaints every time a new character is released saw them with the herta tribbie etc,POSITIVE,0.6661903858184814,1
i think global passives are a cool feature but i think they should be very restrictive for instance castorices passive should only activate for one character once in the battle if shes not on field but if she is on field then every character can revive once per battle instead,NEGATIVE,0.9949559569358826,0

i think a global passive is neat but yeah definitelt too strong without some restrictions lol for example it shpuldnt be allowed in mirrors or apocalyptic shadow or pure fiction unless she is on team other than that i am indeed afraid of the implications this could have on not only hsr but in other hoyo games in general since well a gacha game is still a gacha,NEGATIVE,0.9914685487747192,0

the only problem is see with that is that no sustain teams are getting much more benefited by that than teams with sustains we already are in an meta where sustain less teams are working great and are stronger than teams with sustains in some encounters having a character that heals one character in our sustain less team while she isnt even there that would mean everyone could just play sustain less teams if everyone just plays sustain less teams hoyo will see that thinks like moc get easyer again cause everyone has suddenly more dmg in they team and so one they will inflate the hp massiv again so teams with sustain will not make the needed dmg,NEGATIVE,0.992456316947937,0
she just revived then those resetting your team ro redoing the fight is also power creep like come one they added something that can help you and yall still mad like everything that hoyo do yall thought it some kindo marketing strategies like i dont even play honkai but the players yall just so ungrateful look at that character she is cute and powerful even if she dont have that passive to revived character yall still pull right so yall want character that stay as strong as the other one while the enemy getting stronger yeah goodluck with that,NEGATIVE,0.9565550684928894,0

i mean honestly im ok with this because all of the new characters have a unique animation on their character so i get it i just dont get why it still goes on when castorice isnt there like it would have been better to not effect like a healer but im not against it either and im gonna skip her cause i want anaxa my bitch speech teacher and honestly hoyo need to make money so what was that line like are people serious at this point if you wanna make it easier it will be fine in other situations too like i get it it is hard but like myself i got at least near a yeari think maybe more to beat that bug shit roan mei made so yeah pls get what im getting at yeah,NEGATIVE,0.9910191893577576,0

i repeatto fix this they should just make the global passive obtainable even with clearing some part of the story and make the character only unlocking it without the need of that but anyway i have the sensation we will not see much other global passives after this unlike what most people say honestly its just a sensationbut until now all my sensation were right so i have high hopes,NEGATIVE,0.9975073933601379,0
the gameplay has rules theres way too many characters who break them already and muh lore shouldnt be the excuse here with silverwolf i personally think that was as far as it shouldve gone for weakness implants and i think characters relying on break like ff deserve a certain amount of res ignore but the amount of rule ignoring in the game is too much imo,NEGATIVE,0.9997312426567078,0

in my opinion i think shes so cool and ive been saving since ive got the herta,POSITIVE,0.9991087317466736,1
im saying this here because i know for a fact at least some people will see this note this is my opinion if you disagree i dont care if you dont want the passive to affect your gameplay dont pull the character plain and simple im not pulling for her not because i dont want her i would generally love to have a chance to get a redo button without having to start the whole fight over im not pulling for her because i dont play like that ill get there at some point its just my account is not that strong yet all pulls are for fuge her light cone as well and its not even open for debate is the purple reapers passive strong yes is it game breaking absolutely fucking not if i call my host im sorry i tried to do this on a sub read and a lot of people called me a slur that is depicted towards people with autism so yea they can kiss my ass theyre blowing something up that is not even a issue,NEGATIVE,0.9993277788162231,0
global passives can be good but this one needs a nerf since it can be activated even if shes outside the party gave bailu the middle finger hard i think it wouldve been fine if the player could choose character to make them revive and only them for the combat then sure but even if its only time per battle its basically screaming if you miss out on her the end game will be much harder on you so i hope you whaled hard on your dps,NEGATIVE,0.9987033605575562,0

by lore okay silver wolf literally hacks the universe and all she does is apply a couple debuffs and add a random weakness element of wha tyou have in the party when in lore she could just delete the enemies acheron can oneshot anything by lore but in gameplay you need to apply debuffs before she can even ult which doesnt always oneshot especially with the hp inflation blade and mydei are literally immortal and they have limits in battle welt has an entire black hole and the enemies are still alive yet for cas she basically gets a death confirmation email whenever a team member dies she doesnt even need to be there tldr alot of other characters have part of their lore in gameplay but its balanced and for bailu who can revive its one character if e once a battle and shes also a healer so it makes sense then she also left the meta a long time ago,NEGATIVE,0.9970778226852417,0

bro no one is forcing anyone to anything,NEGATIVE,0.974366307258606,0
the argument that it alligns with her lore is so easily invalidated just make it a passive while she is on the battlefield that would be totally fine also i dont think the ability in itself is currently a problem in a vacuum it becomes a problem once they start designing content with that in mind but the way bigger problem is the premise of global effects on characters even when they are not in the team iirc according to leaks a group of characters will have those kinds of abilities but with stat boosts instead and i think these depending on the stat are way better than castorias,NEGATIVE,0.9993243217468262,0

turn based games is literally one of the most powercreep prone genre in gacha and yet some people still wanna support this havent yall learn from silverwolf she was so so broken on release that she literally caused the ever increasing powercreep in the game cuz they keep inflating every enemy ending with the game pumping out so many characters and supports to counteract the damage she made in the games balance lmao id love to see yall telling people to pull for a random ahh character in the future just because they give plus crit damage in youtube and twitter comments never undermine these little things even if you think the first and only current global passive is useless for you you never know hmm,NEGATIVE,0.9973334074020386,0

first of all its one time so its not like its the end of the world think of almost doubling the go of one character thats it thats the passive two who cares if it breaks the meta its a story based game with zero multiplayer elements three if you complaining because it makes the game easier then so what it fomo for sure if you dont pull her but it was fomo with acheron or aventurine too four if anyone doesnt see an issue in this its kinda an issue and it kinda isnt we dont know the future of star rail so sure theres a lot of unknowns but we cant say exactly what hoyos intentions are im optimistic that hoyo will treat this like adding any other character to the game five its a global passive it works even when she isnt in the team yet again so what it all depends on how hoyo treats the game moving forward and this isnt as meta breaking as you might think six stop hating each other over this everyone is at each other over speculations that this is the end of the world and star rail is dying its not nothing has proven that just stop hating each other if you hate the game that much or you hate the addition of a global passive then quit the game if your just gonna complain that the devs hate you quit the game if you think hoyo is doing this and setting a bad precedent for the future quit the game but then again the boycott didnt work with genshin so my guess is most of you would keep playing anyways,NEGATIVE,0.9974459409713745,0

people who support this are just dumb and wrong firstly her passive isnt even a huge issue by itself the problem is the precedence this sets on the game global passives just for owning a character without them being on the team just a terrible idea its all cool now because you want castorice but wait till its a character you hate and dont want that gives your entire team shields periodically for just existing in your account or a character that gives everyone a free speed or a character that randomly gives someone energy its just a shit idea for any game and if you think this is the only time they are going to do this global passive mechanic i have a bridge to sell you this is dumb and should not be tolerated again its fine if it didnt work in endgame content which is designed to be challenging but from everything weve seen it does,NEGATIVE,0.9951589703559875,0

it maybe a weird take but if they implement these global passives to character majority of players will summon for i dont think its as bad for example of players with an abundance of jades will summon for castorice another example is if this feature is used again and given to phainon like who tf in their right minds will skip phainon lol,NEGATIVE,0.9995576739311218,0

the buff aint that good tbh i get hating globals i do but more of id hate it if it was a dmg enhancing skill survival issues should never happen anyway and if it can happen once good chance ur team was gonna die again unless u died like at or something and for those worried about them just going to keep adding more yeah i can see that being concerning but good news is second half likely wont and also wont have any globals in any characters kits so these globals either are gonna be a super rare thing for a characters if it happens again that is but given they made a custom ui for global passives i dont doubt there may be another in the long future,POSITIVE,0.8202663660049438,1
lets be honest the passive itself does not matter its the fact that there is a passive like that to begin with which opens to door to more egregious global passives to follow it its been the topic of outrage for a while now and anyone whos pretending that its a problem only now is a fool,NEGATIVE,0.9927965998649597,0

this video is kinda missing the point the problem is not the passive itself like aa revive ok but the concept of a global passive is not good cause they can add more and more and passives can include dmg bonus crit bonus speed bonus etc and then hoyo balance endgame around that then it will not be good hoyo has proven to be able to powercreep mecanics example topaz numby and herta technique,NEGATIVE,0.9959614872932434,0

people is overreacting a lot this isnt that big of a deal powercreep will happen from one way or another of course its wrong to have this mechanic around but compared to a character that has busted scalling and makes every single team look the same i think that i prefer this but youll have to pull this new global passive or else your account will be worse yes but we will have to pull in every single case its like complaining that you cant clear moc with seele and supports its a gacha not a balanced jrpg there will always be powercreep that force us to pull better characters like cant you all just save for that unexisting global passive there is a bigger picture but that picture is realizing where you are standing on you are literally complaining about the main monetization method of the game avoiding this passive style wont avoid powercreep you are just asking for them to sugarcoat it,NEGATIVE,0.9985843896865845,0

this is such a bad argument cause all i need to say is this genshin and zz have barely been criticised for their level as power creep as much as sr and your arguments are just missing the point of why people are mad powercreep is always inevitable but when its every other week in a game like this its not very good global passives are now just making this situation worse like genshin hasnt had as much of a power creep problem then star rail has and that game has been out for over years and star rail has been out for nearly and thats just maddening cause there a prime example of how it works but they are just choosing not to do it your excuses are just literally please dont stop insulting my game youre hurting my feelings at this point,NEGATIVE,0.999450147151947,0
teddyisaliar its faster because we are getting characters at a faster rate in that case they should add less characters per patch but we wont be able to make them change their mind because we already had a patch with just one new character and it sold less than the rest im comparing both bad routes and i think that global passives are less worse than keeping powercreeping every single patch i dont expect them to change their ways of design drastically when they know that making kits overloaded is working i hope that if they keep the global passive route they try to at leats making it a slot where you put character to support the team and add a fp option to put there i hate both cases and i know that we all want the game to improve but you cant expect them to literally choose to lose money i would love for them to stop the hp inflation but they wont for me at least it hasnt been a problem i can complete every single endgame mode full stars and i havent expended a single dollar on this game people is doing pull less accounts and can get to stars on moc so i guess that everyone should try checking their builds or invest their jades in a better team that doesnt require them to optimize it or read enemy mechanics,NEGATIVE,0.999137282371521,0
dikikai okay this is just all kinds of wrong and self centered and ignoring alot of factors okay first off the thing is just a bad cause know what other game pulls has banners and doesnt no one talks about powercreep zz cause its not a problem so it can be done and the last part is just the poor rich company excuse and comparing both routes both routes are bad cause they are both intertwined cause if we have to live with the constant powercreep is adding global passives which we fully know is gonna be exploited really a great idea for this game people have already called it greedy so now is it fair people are just gonna get an immediate disadvantage cause a character just exists even then they get powercrept there passives are just gonna be there and im the near future when it all gets stacked it gonna be so not new player and returning player friendly cause of the hp inflation and all the mechanics unless you whip out the bank card and get spending if you hate both cases then why are you literally going out of your way to justify and defend it and make out people are overreacting when this is a serious problem for the near future and lose out on money you do realise this can be a double edged sword cause people can just drop the game instead and say enough is enough and the last part is literally the worst part i havent had a problem so i think its okay and other people should get good and make better choices and look at themselveswhat do you even know what your saying lets break it down you literally went i havent had this problem therefore its not really a problem yes for you new players and returning this definitely isnt a problem cause you missed out and you are gonna pay for it cause you havent been keeping up with the meta check their builds you make it out to be like its something we can control yes let me just ask get relics from the hand of god and im sure hell deliver oh wait i cant cause the whole system is rng what bad defence invest their jades better yes lets invest our jades fully knowing hoyo can easily just decide to change how the game works and then that character is useless hey remember sparkle well guess what shes useless now cause we going all in on the break meta now so hurry up and catch up again a terrible defence enemy mechanics really whats that you invested all your jades into the lastest black swan and wanting to use your kafka dot team well sorry but you see the current moc and endgame content is revolving around break and follow up attack and its gonna be like this for the next few patches so even tho you lost hard pity and lost all your jades go get firefly and ruan mei to have a chance do you actually see how flawed your reasoning is your defences are literally dont mean to the big company i understand this is a bad situation but this is kinda actually your fault for not getting good rng on relics and poorly investing your jades even though hoyo can decide to change how the game functions any moment on a whim just stop already you literally lost all creditability when you said i understand this is bad but decided to justify and defend it and make out people are the problem cause they cant predict the future,NEGATIVE,0.9994999170303345,0
teddyisaliar you cant say that is unplayable when there are literally zero cycles done with es or es and whats your excuse for people being able to have zero pull accounts and still make it to stars from time to time its a resource management game you cant complete it you failed at it as easy as that aside from that is powercreep really that big of a deal i mean would you leave the game only because you couldnt complete moc with stars because i think if the only thing avoiding you leaving the game are like jades per patch then yeah leave you are not enjoying the other of the game and why so annoyed of a random comment on a short to the point where you literally make up a narrative about how i was defending hoyo and felt bad because you attacked the game when i literally said that i dont liked the idea but at least it wasnt that bad and it still depends on hoyo if they make it busted or balanced aside from that do you think that hoyos looking for feedback here they dont care about us when has the english community gotten anything out of their complains castorice sells will be high anyway and we cant do anything about that if thats their green light to keep making global passives,NEGATIVE,0.9994428753852844,0
dikikai okay the first comment literally just showed you just ignored everything i said like you really think people can just choose who they get and want you really think they can always be prepared when they suddenly change meta you really think everyome can get lucky in pulls and relics is it really a big of a dealjesus christ you are literally ignoring the whole point of this whole discussion power creep on games is bad the whole point of playing a game is for challenge and enjoyment and if the game is literally becoming unenjoyable because the game is getting really bad with how its handling said game you are literally doing it again you just ignoring the whole point of the discussion and annoyed who said im annoyed im just baffled at people like yourself cause your logic makes no sense cause again you say you understand why people are not happy i called out how your messages come across and you just ignore what i say to fit your own narrative and your whole things is they wont care so im just gonna accept and again justify and blame other people for it and again you still fail to understand you just go well rn its not that bad and thats the point look at powercreep its already bad and if you really think that global passives aint gonna be a its a just maybe it will be then idk what to say also i didnt make up a narrative this is literally what you said yourself you literally just went i know its a problem but ill justify it regardless just at this point just stop if this is just a comment on a short just dont bother then,NEGATIVE,0.9995405673980713,0
teddyisaliar you still didnt mention why people can make it with pulls personally im baffled of people that are going to quit because they cant get a star or two per patch youll got so far with this game just to say hoyo make every single team viable or ill leave thats a tantrum and shows that you arent enjoying the game most of the content isnt even endgame so why bother if you only will enjoy of it at that point that became a job,NEGATIVE,0.9984419941902161,0
dikikai pulls yea i dont believe that at all cause that just sounds like you making stuff up and you are baffled cause of that reason again you missing the point no one is asking making all teams viable people are asking stop the power creep give characters a chance stop changing the meta on a whim give characters an actual chance to shine or idk add a character who can actually help older characters its not just about a star its about the potential state of the game what are you literally failing to understand here now you just contradicted yourself cause you clearly show you have no idea whats going on here so just stop you are just a hypocrite at this rate,NEGATIVE,0.9990609288215637,0

to me as long it isnt states or big then it is fine no that shield at the start if the battle isnt broken that flat def is tho like imagine the new healer just gives outgoing healing bonus that would be op but to me as long they dont make them stackdont make them too strong then i dont mind it i have played hird and they have the divine key system which gives you buffs based on if you get some specific weapons you dont need the have them to clear the endgame content tho maybe they changed in part last time i played was when fu hua got a new battle suit,NEGATIVE,0.9918373227119446,0
i love that this is the final straw for players not silver wolf who gave enemies a weakness that they didnt have in order for it to make it easier to break their shields not ruan mei who gave you crazy buffs to break through opponents a lot more easier not robin who have your team an forward attack but also does crazy attack damage buffs for your characters not firefly who gives the enemy an automatic fire weakness when using her skill not acheron who was the first crazy damage dps character we actually got not sunday who boots us forward and our little pets that we take into battle not fugue who automatically gives us super break and gives the enemy a nd shield break for massive bonus damage not tribi who needed c or c to do crazy amounts of team wide damage i forgot which one it is but now this is the final straw all i have to say to people getting upset about this isget the fuk outta here with this bullshit bruh the game has always been predatory the game has always had must pulls ruan mei being probably the longest running one until fugue came out,NEGATIVE,0.993209183216095,0

the reason why people are against the global passive is because this opens up the possibility that future characters have global passives as well and with hsrs history of power creeping within a couple of patches this could lead to global passives being way too powerful for the game leading to the endgame content being centred around these global passives which will essentially lock anyone who doesnt have these characters out of endgame content,NEGATIVE,0.9992056488990784,0

the thing is i understand that people think it opens the pandoras box and were gonna get passives that increase crit and energy soon and other things like thatbut will we really maybe im putting too much faith in hoyo but the global passive is attached to castorice an anniversary character theyre supposed to be special like that we also got a pretty damn broken technique with acheron who was an anniversary character imo much more fomo ability than what castorice has revive is pretty inconsequential if you have a well built team hoyo definitely heard the playerbase is not happy with the global passive but decided to give it to her anyways now we just need to wait and see what they do with it in the future for all we know she could be the only character with a global passive and this all will be forgotten in a few months time maybe theyll give global passives to everyone and make it a gameplay feature by only allowing you to have global passives of your choice or something like that either way we dont know what will happen but im willing to give them the benefit of doubt until then im still having fun with the game so this is nothing to quit over for me,NEGATIVE,0.983044445514679,0

idk if anyones gonna see or read this but im going to say it anyway hsr is probably the same track with hird where powercreep is at its worst and old s ranks star equivalent characters are not only unusable but literally forgotten to the point hoyo gives them for free it has already started with ruan mei and luocha from the livestream and they will probably continue for me global buffs are definitely broken and maybe should not be in the game and i will agree if it is the case for a game with pvp feature the thing is hsr is a single player game and theres literally no need for competitiveness to enjoy it so global buffs meant nothing but having an easier time clearing endgame contents if youre worried about not getting every jades from moc apoc and pf then get what you can and strategize your pull no ones forcing you to pull every characters no ones forcing you to top up and no ones forcing you to clear every endgame content so just do your own thing in the game and if you dont enjoy it anymore just leave it i literally dont understand this drama cause why are you all worrying when you dont even need to be competitive in this game and castorice will probably get powercreep again in the future this is a gacha game with honkai in its title if you dont play hi then just know that the powercreep is gonna get worse so be prepared and do your math for your pulls,NEGATIVE,0.9994503855705261,0
doesnt matter if its tide to the lore or not unfortunately the door that this global passive opens is just too huge to ignore if hoyoverse would say its okay we will never use it again because it is tied to the anniversary character then id be less pestimistic but we are talking about hoyoverse and leaks already comfirmed multiple global passive characters coming worse is if this character sells well wich she probably will other gacha corporations will get a peek out of it meaning that there is a very good chance that hoyoverse just released a cancer into the gacha genre infecting all future games as well as long as they get away with it other companies will try to do same scumy and greedy methods as well now all characters will feel like that they are a must pull wich makes the game wich is already pretty predatory into even more predatory big sad,NEGATIVE,0.999278724193573,0

yeah they might make more unique passives and push the limit i understand that but her being pw or a must have is right and wrong at the same time pw u just need to get her e must have nah her global passive feels like lore accurate but if they make something like passive slot which u have to select one passive and only that one can work there will be no problems so peoples concerns are valid but being pw or must have doesnt make sense to me its just what they might do in the future,NEGATIVE,0.9978938698768616,0
the main issue i see is the combination of a global always active passive once you get her and the fact shes a character you might be unable to get if youre fp or have to pay real money to get you could nerf the passive to only trigger when shes actively in battle at which point it would be a variation of bailus gourdful of elixir which can revive character and heal them partially castorice could only revive but would rely on others to do the healing in return she can revive several people not just one the global buffpassive itself would be fine if it wasnt linked to something you potentially had to use real money to buy if they were to introduce some kind of towerdungeon system where you have to beat a dungeon every week and in return you could choose a temp buff for your battles thatd be fine since you could do that even with fp teams from what ive heard castorice wont be the only one with a global passive other characters in the near future are supposed to have something similar and they will most likely all come out basically back to back if thats true any fp player has to essentially gamble and choose which global passive they want because being able to get all of the global passives might be very well impossible for them another issue is powercreep if were already at the level where a character even at level and never being used is able to provide a significant power boost to any team one has to wonder whats next on the agenda there has to be a balance at some point where new characters dont come with unique broken skills or otherwise the original characters are essentially going to end up being useless,NEGATIVE,0.9994211196899414,0

personally i have no issue with castorices passive as someone who is pulling for cas myself i see the passive as pretty much useless unless youre a newer player you shouldnt even be dying in combat so often thus her passive will rarely even be used at all the only issue with this implementation is the precedent it brings in potentially releasing game breaking passives in the future which is an issue for a lot of the player base as it could lead to future characters being pw though i honestly dont have an issue with this either i dont really care if theyre gonna add more global buffs i dont care if they release anything game breaking im still pulling for cas and would definitely pull for phainon ill still be playing the game even if it leans towards a more pw future i love the game and ive invested a lot in it to suddenly just boycott people who are boycotting and complaining have to realise that there are people who wont care and will support whatever hoyo does and to me thats okay like how its also okay to hate what the game and company has and will become,NEGATIVE,0.998180627822876,0

global passives arent a problem only if a is unique lets say to anniversary characters or b provides a niche buff that is conditionally useful castorices global passive itself is mid as hell only really useful to those zerocyclers and for tanking a boss special move once the former of which isnt really that special just a small qol to sustainless comps granting them an extra turn which could alleviate some cycle clears failing and the latter being somewhat a skill issue if you let the boss do their special move youre doing something wrong there is always if not most of the time a proper mechanic you have to deal with in order to not get nuked by the boss and if the boss has no special move you are not dying if you have a proper sustain ok if you die to overworld mobs i hate to break it to you but thats a skill issue if its to bosses what i said above will apply properly read and use the boss mechanic to your advantage while yes its quite a dangerous precedent to the future characters do note that saying flat out omg castorice has a global passive now everyone else js gonna get them is a big slippery slope fallacy and has no current proofs supporting it this is also why a exists if its unique there wouldnt be the problem of having to pull everyone for their global passive i see jokes about ok guys everyone has a global passive or whatever and while they are somewhat funny its a big slipperly slope to say that theyd go and add this when there arent any proofs that support it and no powercreep is not a supporting proof for the global passive powercreep is a phenomenon that affects almost all games and is not a supporting proof because of its definition lets start with that the formal definition of powercreep is increase the power of a relatively new unit over old units in order to make the old unit feel less relevant no older unit will feel less relevant with the addition of this passive bailu now you have two revives instead of one fu xuan e same thing two revives instead of one,NEGATIVE,0.9995180368423462,0

ive been talking about this on reddit with the others and someone had the idea that perhaps its just a qol feature specific to a few characters that eventually gets dropped in favour of something else kind of like how acheron feixiao and maybe ff have a qol for pretty much instakilling mobs its amazing but ultimately not the thing that will determine the future of your account edit and remember back when acheron was the first and only one to do this people were also angry about the qol powercreep and how they have to pull acheron despite not liking her just to make farming mobs easier i myself was inclined to pull her but then feixiao came along who i was gonna pull anyway and who can take care of mobs in a similar fashion im really hoping that to be the case here too that this batch of characters have the special stars with niche but kinda useful global passives to make them more unique and tempting and thats that because in itself castorices passive is okay it needs a sustain to work well and in case a sustain is on the team most people probably arent dying anyways and if they do because they struggle with sustain chances are the revive wont help them unless theyre like one hit away from winning without sustain it only applies to sustainless runs which is usually done by more skilled players with better built characters anyway it can be useful there to combat bad rng once but only once cutting down the attempts from idk to overall my opinion is that castorices passive isnt all that great in practice its a cool qol but there are few times when it will actually impact your performance in a significant amount like as said when youre one hit away from winning when your dps gets knocked down if all passives are similar instead of being just flat out universal stat boosts then i think this could be something unique and fun the problem comes if they do start producing characters that just boost stats for now ill choose to try and be positive enjoy the game and its new characters get back into the story and hope hoyo handles global passives in a good way rather than going the pure greed route,NEGATIVE,0.9938791990280151,0

it wouldnt be much of a deal if she was just an op character that will stay in meta for long like how furina is a huge support and can also walk over the water infinitely but the fact she is most likely going to get powercrepted in two or three patches is the major issue when phainon cyrene or even marchs new form come out she will no longer be as good just like what happened with acheron and firefly,NEGATIVE,0.9984503984451294,0
slippery slope fallacy technically this global passive isnt that egregious but what about for future characters it could lead to permanent stat bonuses for all characters on an account essentially forcing players to pull for a character they do not want if they want to clear most endgame especially with older characters this is bad the power creep is completely off the rails in star rail instead of power creeping characters hoyo is power creeping entire accounts with this one in the not too distant future,NEGATIVE,0.9995998740196228,0
grimmreapgi the issue has never been its power it is the precedent it sets time revive at hp is nowhere near op anyone complaining about that is stupid where it does matter is that castorice sets a precedent for hoyoverse to add more busted shit like stat and talent level ups in global passives on limited time characters where the way to acquire them is through a factual gambling system hsr past the early updates has never had the players have an issue with dying the global passive is a anti consumer practice that hoyo is gping to be using to squeeze more money out of characters after all whats more valuable than a character that does stuff on the bench if hoyo really wants to put in global passives for the quality of life or health of the game then they can easily put it on the mc they have various different forms to do that but they dont they will put the passives on a select few units if you want an example of this thing happening just look at how fast hoyoverse implented new characters on par with acherons damage only a couple of patches after her release,NEGATIVE,0.999118983745575,0

i personally think the hate is incredibly overblown castorices passive is incrediblely niche in its application as if you are in a situation where a character is dying once youre already in state that proves that you arent fit for whatever content youre in it might be a safety net for sloppy play but provides no increase in actual combat strength if anything this is the logical progression of hsrs power scaling it is a gatcha game and characters do need to be doing something new to remain profitable and with how vastly limited the combat system is in hsr this is a pretty decent direction to take,NEGATIVE,0.9839072227478027,0

okay but this is a problem cause zz and genshin power creep problem is non existent so they know how to do it but they just choose not to and you are missing the point of what it means for the future and this could eventually be another ruan mei situation where in time it will become basically essential cause of how they decided to shift the meta and im sorry global passives is not a good direction to take cause we now know its gonna open the floor gates how long till spd atk crit auto healing passives its just gonna make everything pointless at this point the path system is already terrible cause they just threw that out the window so i just need to understand why defend such a bad implementation,NEGATIVE,0.9997984766960144,0

lovingorilla no im sane fortunately unlike you you have got to be kidding me if you think criticism and hate is similar in any fcking way i want more male characters too but the way the fandom goes about it is plain icky yall were simping for mydei because hes half naked but varesa has a short skirt so shes automatically waifu bait also lesbians exist its not only the male fans being serviced like you guys love to claim as an excuse to dismiss a fenale character and refuse to see past her appearanceyall just want to sexualize men too lets not play victim and claim to see only one side of the coin hoyo definitely needs to do better but my problem is with people like you who hate being in the vicinity of women online like did yall not see the absolutely senseless hate train for jade chascarappa and even varesa now you can also count in castorice now too the comments are not criticism for company but filled with hate and misogynistic intent always bashing women charas like ohh why does she have a kitty i dont like charas with kitty etc i have actually seen such exact comments its plain weird how in the big year of youre going to seriously tell me im insane for defending women like have we fallen that far as a community did yall not see how the only time hsr fanbase was happy recently was during sundays banner all the girls i repeat all the girls were hated just because they had a banner before sunday yall are delusional if you think what youre doing is right and feminist or whatever,NEGATIVE,0.997789740562439,0

miraufie i dont really see the problem about them slowly merging hsr world with his both games already have a direct connection because of welt and tbh it was going to happen eventually regardless because theyll need to progress welts plot id it all depends on how they execute it if theyre able to make that its not necessary to play hi to properly understand hsr like how it currently is then that would be great but if they go for the other route that theyre desperate to attract more players to hi then that would be pretty shitty move,NEGATIVE,0.9993458390235901,0
fishman thats the problem they are desperate to attract more players to play hi since hi is hoyos beloved game hence why they are slowly merging both worlds seeing as vita became member of masked fools after they added sparkle there i wouldnt be surprise if they will add vita to hsr in the future to attract players to hi and they expect hsr players to go check hi for characters lores for the variants added in hsr shitty move alright,NEGATIVE,0.9949224591255188,0
miraufie as a hi fan id say that at this point they should just stop trying and just make hi if they want to attract players the main reasons why they couldnt get players into hi is because of how old it is even after part and seeing how much the game is behind newer games and how the plot is going in part along with the fact that this game has a female only character roster wouldnt attract the general audience even though they have male characters that have perfect potential to be playable like kevin welt otto kalpas etc i know theyre partially playable in the story but theyre actual playable characters that you can use in combat and stuff and male characters like zhongli blade neuvillette etc did attract a lot of people to genshin and hsr and im saying this as a dude myself i had no internet in genshin until i saw zhongli and thought dang this dude looks pretty sick id honestly like that hoyo just makes hi that continues whatever the hell theyre trying to do and either eos hi and create an offline version that doesnt include gacha for like or something or leave it in the state like how they left ggz or the most unlikely one eos the game then make a full fledge aa remake that streamlines the story give adam an actual personality and probably make aphos writing better and also have playable male characters because they didnt have to put this much effort into them if you cant even play them,NEGATIVE,0.9995445609092712,0
fishman isnt that why hsr existed in the first place they couldnt add playable male characters in hi because the cn male players got angry at the thought of their waifu cheating on them even adam got hated because of that no so they created a new honkai game but this time with male playable characters added from the start instead since hoyo loves hi very much they should just focus on making hi good instead of forcing hsr players to go and play hi instead amphoreus is boring because it is a rehash of elysian realm all over again with cyrene of course being the god i heard that the next planet would be edo star so we will be seeing the sakura of hsr speaking of adam i dont mind hoyo porting him to hsr he would be much better in hsr than in hi so long as they dont mistreat him like they did with phainon that is,NEGATIVE,0.9980108141899109,0
miraufie allegedly thats one of the reasons why they created hsr but hsr was in development around the same time as genshin so they probably just thought that might as well should make this game mixed gendered as well from the get go especially since the protagonist that they just designed is male and that they are bringing welt into it adam did get a lot of hate from cn players so hoyo tried to please them by making him into a generic self insert and stripped away his personality remnants of it are still present in it game especially with his interactions with lyle they ended up shooting themselves in the foot because of this as cn players still disliked him and people who wanted male characters were disappointed fortunately the fanbase developed a personality for him like how persona fans developed a personality for their mcs by the dialogue options obviously this ended up in two types of groups one who claim that adam is a harem protagonist and the other that everyone loves that the dude is just chasing after the paycheck if hoyo were to port him to hsr theyd have to give him a proper personality so id like him to use whatever they were originally planning for him add the paycheck joke that fans created and not have some sort of relation with mei in this case acheron id like him to be a character who can stand on his own,NEGATIVE,0.9991931319236755,0
bang_ladon yeah as a woman im so embarassed and appalled at the height of internalized misogyny in these people they never would have complained about a supposedly op character if it was a male and it would only make them simp for him more these girls are basically femcels similar to the chinese incels who cant stand the existence of their gender in a game they just dont want to admit they dont like seeing their fav man with women classic mentality of women whose mund have ingrained fandom culture so much jealousy and contempt for a fictional character all these women need to get a life if they think this female op character is in any way a huge issue,NEGATIVE,0.9920338988304138,0
a_renns ah of course the same female characters that get absolutely sidelined by the fandom and hated on from day one for simply existing are fanservice and privileged got it how does your mind work is your mother also fan service btw are you isnt your existence itself appealing to men and hence youre automatically fan service that wasnt meant to exist see how absolutely braindead you sound a female character having op skill set is not privilege or fan service by your logic mydei is a conservatively oriented and appeals to only men too right since hes so obviously fan service and popular too with a great role to play in the story how truly dumb are you im actually quite concerned for people with your way of thinking if it bothers you soo much maybe just go play lads you know no straight boy or supposed incel is playing that game to be able to disturb your experience stop playing hoyo games all this whining for naught,NEGATIVE,0.998301088809967,0

people who defend it because of the lore are stoopid the problem isnt that its not lore accurate its that it forces you to pull for her it would have been better to give the passive to anyone who completed a certain quest like literally any rpg would have done,NEGATIVE,0.9992444515228271,0
for me her passive skill even not in party is considered too op it may match the lore but that excuse is horrible justifying anything by using lore is terrible move if theres characters that the lore tell us about hisher undefeated streaks and the skill make you win anyway then why we need to play dont be a smart a tell me that her skill isnt pay to win because it just revived you etc you knew what i mean this is also cause the problem with designing challenge imagine they consider this skill as requirements to perform well in challenges then other whom havent her will be suffer i would suggest to let her buff team just for a bit instead it doesnt effect gameplay much and still benefits whom have her and for tactic revenue i believe we had already seen this kind of tactic before but guess what no one care that much and let it pass for some reason even its clearly,NEGATIVE,0.9958114624023438,0
i think i understand now why its such an issue but for castorices case its going to be a skill issue if you die you can always restart the encounter anyway and you need to recieve healing or a shield to properly revive so if you are thinking of going sustainless then its not going to work i might sound tone deaf but i dont care,NEGATIVE,0.9928800463676453,0

people are fearing for something that will happen in future i dont play hsr but its funny to see the current state of the community especially when they felt do superior to other gacha games when it released this is what happens once the fanbase got stable after release and no game is generous for players experience these companies are only generous because its their marketing,POSITIVE,0.8489933609962463,1
its not really that big of a deal its not like you can suddenly play sustainless and not get punished for it you still need a healer in your team which doesnt change much compared to how team building works previously sure you can argue that it sets a bad example for future character like having x character would give you permanent def ignore even if that character is not in your team but i think hoyo knows it too that if they do that it wont end well for now castorice ability imo is alright its not meta breaking or anything its just a cool side bonus,NEGATIVE,0.7770028114318848,0
why are people glazing it in the pretense its so cool being lore accurate i get theres moments where thats good but theres more serious matters that take priority if people hadnt grown up with these kinds of games maybe thered be hope to reject these practices but at this point only the government can do something gachas heavily manipulates you with dopamine rewards incentives theyve brainwashed the population its over for the common folk and they literally lost the capacity to think,NEGATIVE,0.9995120763778687,0

yeah this whole global passive concept is way absurd even in pvp oriented games like epic do not have this kind of thing castorice passive yes its not op however it will be the start of other op passives in the near future because the devs have planned to implement this in future characters in this year about the rewards which many people happy it isnt that good first free pulls same as last year anniversary nothing special second free luocha ruanmei a character who is going to be replaced by that hyacine in and the other one is already on the other side of the hill like seriously the hell devs doing third changes in system we can get seelebladefuxuan now thats a big l whos gonna use them seele can moc with only world class relics and op support so dont use that argument other cases like blade is the same with seele final changes in shop we can get limited characterslightcones a change for whales not to mention the powercreep situation is insane now devs announced they will buff sw kaf jingliu and blade in why so slow by the time the buff arrives i doubt it will solve the problem i can see they are following the hi path now,NEGATIVE,0.9987548589706421,0

the problem isnt that the character is good but that every account that doesnt pull for castorice will be objectively worse their entire account like if players have the exact same the herta team with the exact same relics and traces and everything but one of them pulled for castorice costs around worth of jades btw well their team is better because every one of their character can just not die once then people say oh its just a revive its nothing much but thats the point this time its only a revive but what will it be next maybe itll be a little bit of healing the team then maybe a little bit of a follow up on an ennemy maybe a debuff on all the ennemies then maybe some crit rate increase for the team then maybe its the entire character fighting for you even when its not on the team the skys the limit what we are upset about are these possibilities of account defining characters and if you think its not gonna happend well its hoyo were talking about if they can make more money they will,NEGATIVE,0.9987351298332214,0

finiraelkhami its not pvp so why do you care that someone has a better character than you if youre actually good at the game then not having castorice shouldnt make you struggle if youre having a hard time with the game its not because you dont have a revive passive its because you need to practice on some easier battles to get better at the game,NEGATIVE,0.9967657327651978,0
you are doing classic doomposting right now do you need a reminder that same thing happened with acheron out of combat skill everyone cried its gonna be overpowered and not having acheron will make your acc worse and now shes still the only one who can instakill enemies and in the end nobody really cares for it its simple quality of life feature and so is said revive if you need it its just skill issue if you dont need it and everyone who has any idea how teambuilding works wont ever need it then it might be just another qol feature that will save you one unlucky reset on moc due to enemy targeting,NEGATIVE,0.9980408549308777,0
kurumitksaki except in acherons case its just nice to have sure easier exploration but thats its you cant use it for bosses nor end game contents like moc pure fiction whilst castorice is a global effect that activates even when shes not in the team she can stand in bench for all we care and it still activates its not really a problem rn but it may become a problem for future characters because whats next a global heal or a global shield that activates when characters get low hp a global followup attack when an enemy gets low hp a global stat buff speed crit rd yes its not pvp but if just having the character makes end game content easier then its a problem,NEGATIVE,0.7437314391136169,0
dlenn my brother you didnt got my point right now as far as im concerned there isnt a single reliable leak about any other global passive and people are outraged about global passives being gamebreaking in the future sure i agree that this might really quickly go downhill but castorice passive isnt anything to be outraged by and i gave acheron as an example of same thing happening in the past just wait and see if next global passive will come out and its gonna be broken then its time to be mad doomposting about assumptions wont change anything,NEGATIVE,0.997334361076355,0

personally in my mind the devs had two options they couldve introduced global passives as a separate announcement and give existing characters especially the free units passives already however theres the second option that they took and outright gave it to the new limited character i peacefully left on my own behalf from hsr since but idk if i could even tolerate with whats happening to the game recently,NEGATIVE,0.9975675344467163,0

and your mindset is going to fucking kill the game acherons technique helps with overworld exploration by basically removing enemies her technique doesnt instakill a boss in moc its far from the same thing as castorices global passive which helps you out in endgame modes besides we did get other characters who also help out in the overwordl massively like the herta locating treasure chests or feixiao with the speed boost and who also makes you able to just ignord enemies in the overworld rappa with the speed boost as well or even robin there are more its really sad to see that people like you are actively defending this shitty and scummy behavior but i guess if you want star rail to die then suit yourself literally turning into the genshin fandom and castorice is going to sell well,POSITIVE,0.9442639946937561,1

athai_ the problem is is silver wold exist in early and shes a debuffer so theres not too much of a power creeping and shes perfectly effective in mono quantum but being in multiple element team even with just quantum any element in team her elemental change gets ruin or if youre fighting multiple enemies who isnt a quantum weakness removes her op side yes you can apply weakness but the thing is the more elements you have in team the more harder it is to get what you need me as a silver wolf user since her first banner release already seen this flaw thats why i only use her in mono quantum because you only have ro worry about chance of not applying debuffs to enemies and will always focus on planting quantum element trust me its more fun using silver wolf in mono quantum than in any set up in fact that the only way you can say shes op is she is the main carry of mono quantum because she dont have to plant another element weakness and will always land as quantum she isnt op or powercreeping anyone because her skill and ulti only land in enemy at a time welt seele is strong even after silver wolf just released castorice on the other hand shows a big powercreep jump and give an idea for even bigger powercreep jump in future because of global buff this thing is new and ut is kinda broken but it open up more potential of op shes a remembrance the fact she already have a global buff and then if you use her as active you get another bastard on the side and the fact her eidolon even got buffed after the community complain which is funny but anyways im pulling for her not because of powercreeping w,NEGATIVE,0.9246912002563477,0
joaquinxqwo as i stated in another post people are giving hoyo way too much credit on global passives none will ever be game breaking because it is not hoyos way of making the game easier that way their version of powercreep will always be charactersgear first with global passives being way down the line of what is needed look at hi divine keys exist are global passives but arent mandatory unless you are in desperate need for xtals a week,NEGATIVE,0.9969770908355713,0
bunnyx well yeah obviously because those whatifs have already been shown in the power creep already present in the game right now as much as i love hsr this is taking it too far with a global passive such as this look at all the older characters theyre practically useless in the current endgame modes and even the bosses in the story are too hard to fight even with a good build of said characters and i do love castorice dont get me wrong a lot of the meta characters are my favorites but even so i cant pull for each one so yk its kinda unfair for them to make characters with such op buffs,NEGATIVE,0.997500479221344,0

im_motivatedayato thats not how it works i am myself pulling for rice but the global passive thing will force players to pull for broken passives on characters they dont like you will be pulling for features not the characters at this point and if you will struggle in any gamemode people will start calling you stupid cause you didnt pull essential global passive when for example phainon would give you the option to equip lcs which would boost your stats by literally double while also getting effects from the nd lc being fp will become unrelatable for whole community or imagine if all future characters would give you some sort of global passive and for example the character you like will get the garbage one compared to his competition like attack boost vs def shredres penspeed,NEGATIVE,0.9979838132858276,0

im sorry but this is probably the most ignorant and arrogant take i have seen in a long time you make out people only care about the meta now like are you blind people have been complaining about the meta since jingliu came out cause of the gross power creep and then since post sparkle everyone has been complaining about how powercreep was getting out of hand and then when firefly came out and break became the dominant meta by design people were not happy and you i like how you picked and chose what people have said to fit your own narrative about the global passives cause here is the thing yes it is a broken ability and unfair to just have an auto revive just for existing and not being in the team as it should have been cause like people have said if this is the future its only gonna get worse since all these abilities will stack and how long till we get atk crit sod auto healing boosts and on top of that with how power creep is in this game im sure shes now a top meta unit so now its just a gross win win situation and sets a bad slate for the future and your last point is probably one of the worst overused poorly thought out excuses there is cause there are a lot of gacha games which arent pw the problem and yes there are always aspects in games the problem here is its being pushed in your face and the implementation so really you call people dumb but in actuality you are probably the dumb one here cause of how pig headed you are and if you want an easy example lets look at hoyos other releases genshin and zz notice how very few people complain about the power scaling but in this game its prominently talked about so really i think its best you do some basic research and have an actual idea of what you are talking about before you look like a fool and if you are just gonna come back with i think this and i have no problem with this there for i am right just dont even reply,NEGATIVE,0.9993910789489746,0

willy_ okay you are really missing the point of why people are not happy cause think of it like this people have been complaining a lot recently about how powercreep happening every other week is getting out of hand the hp inflation in end game modes are getting way too bloated by adding these global passives that means difficulty will only get worse and we know they are gonna add new passives and old units getting buffs is just no its not gonna fix anything like congratulations you went from a to a and you say right builds and teams thats easier said then done cause of people do not get relics the hand of god has and no guarantee havent you been focusing on the meta when they decided lets make break units the big thing everything was centered around break the hp inflation is cause of the new units so it is guaranteed they will make content around this and its a grim outlook for the future,NEGATIVE,0.9983929991722107,0

notme the best part is that we dont know but just like we get incredibly broken characters we can only assume that the same thing will happen crit rate crit damage exta hp etc but not only is that the point but eventually people are going to be pulling for the global passives idk if i have to point it out but thats bad for the players good for the billionaire company its not uncommon for companies to test the boundaries of their consumers to see how much they can get away with it happens all the time,NEGATIVE,0.9995813965797424,0

xeenoo i understand what you mean im also fp i got back into the game recently but their tactics definitely work considering that theyre consistently at the top of gacha games when it comes to making money the purpose of gacha games is to get players to spend money ie limited banners just because you and i dont spend on the game doesnt mean that others also dont im just saying that because people continuously put up with their bad behavior or be passive about it it just makes the game worse side note but relevant its why we dont get good qol updates because people arent very vocal about it and continue giving their money to this game lol,POSITIVE,0.9052481651306152,1

xeenoo because it is locked behind a literal paywall tf you mean each update only gives you enough pulls for a near chance to get a star via soft pity and then you need to contend with the this passive and future ones is not garunteed and you know it isnt it is bad for the consumer you nimwit the billion dollar company with a gambling mechanic just roped you in again with another incentive to keep pulling and inticing you to cave in to spend money if this passive was a only active when castorice is on the team or b applied to the main character or a standard banner unit this would be fine it is not about the revive being op and unfair this is a game where you spam your buttons and defeat the moc enemy without breaking a sweat dying has never been an issue in this game and its not about that lets put this into irl terms for you because let me remind you a gacha game is factually gambling if you go play at the casino and go their brand new slot machine that lets you get an additional bonus for pulling a certain limited time value that gives you better chances at winning what do you think is happening here the answer is obvious the house is enticing you to keep pulling the slots until you get that value because otherwise you lose out its limited time after all and it benefits you forever anyone with a brain will say thats predatory it is not good for the consumer it gives the illusion that it is good for you but all it does at the end of the day is line more of your money into the houses pockets but no add a anime waifu and some mind numbing gameplay with sick animations and suddenly its no longer predatory right even though both the limited time character passive because the character is limited time and limited time special value mechanically serve the same purpose every gacha is inheriently predatory whether you like or not and if you are free to play it doesnt fucking matter a casino that lets you play for free limited time is still a fucking casino i like playing gacha games just like how i like playing normal games at no point should any player start defending the developers from trying to squeeze more money from their community look at any gacha cc look at how everyone hates lootboxes a western gacha mechanic look at any offical opinion look at any law document chinese american or otherwise the consensus is clear to see gacha is gambling and gambling is inherinently predatory even the time you spend is a currency thats why you are able to play for free you are paying with your time,NEGATIVE,0.9988095760345459,0
yes,POSITIVE,0.9997805953025818,1
uh no the game does balance itself around the new characters for both story and endgame this is beyond the scope of global passives btw which is why powercreep discussionscontroversy is such a serious issue in hsr it makes powercreep discussions in other games like arknights look like a joke in comparison i can guarantee if hsr stops excessive shilling of new characters and funnels all the hp inflation to a new moc or apocpf that doesnt provide any jadesjust miscel rewards of powercreep complaints will dissolve immediately,NEGATIVE,0.9995242357254028,0
dchy beyond the scope meaning global passive isnt included in any case if this is a similar case to genshin where the abyss syzygyimaginarium theatre buff works in parallel with the current banners it doesnt mean the abysstheatre is impossible to complete without it it looks like the ceiling is lowered if you pull but even without pulling youre not locked out of anything unfairly if you play the game regularly you can pull regularly thats what the buffs are balanced around just because the banner matches the effect doesnt mean your only option is to pay and i bet most paying players couldnt care less about the endgame effect cycles if you play the game normally you can still play around those effects you can still clear the endgame challenges without them and you arent guaranteed to do any better even if you did get the character the only thing predatory is the limited resin reserves and the fact that youd have to pay for extra this might give someone trouble in building the characters that fit the effect niche if matching new characters to fit certain gameplay effects isnt the case and i assumed it was at least similar because hoyo mechanics are somewhat universal especially between hsr and gsi i dont get how they would even begin to make the endgame revolve around one specific characters ability with each iteration of said endgame cause thats never been the case,NEGATIVE,0.9977471232414246,0
is it weird that im the only one not complaining or,NEGATIVE,0.9845957159996033,0
im not really sure i see much of an issue with this to be honest since it does only happen once per battle plus it is onlt to make it easier its not mandatory plus in the same patch we can choose to get a free healer at the same time meaning that even if even if someone chooses to not get castorice you still get a healer thats still pretty good i think thats just because i already have most of the healers in game tho,NEGATIVE,0.6987963914871216,0

if you support this you are part of the problem it should be limited to having her on the team it doesnt need to be a global passive to fit her lore as if thats even a reason in the first place it is innovative sure but in a bad way having this global passive sets a bad precedence for future characters especially when theres already evidence found of there being more characters that will have global passives,NEGATIVE,0.9988235831260681,0

hoyo does have a very strong preference to cater to whales and new fps which is their primary demographic of target for almost all their business practices including this global passive the only problem is they have no qualms of fucking everyone else in the middle veteran fps and small spenders to do that even if they dont have to which i believe is the primary criticism most ppl have for hoyo the powercreep lies in the inclusion of global passives as precedent for hp inflation which is alr bad even without it,NEGATIVE,0.9926788806915283,0

global passive is really powerful effect which you only need her to be existing on your account either you need to fully build her or leave her on lvl i would be really jealous cause i planning to get castorice on her rerun her revive passive should have only when she is on team i really love castorice as she remind me of griseo i really wanna get her but im saving for hyacine,POSITIVE,0.9877792000770569,1

soi hope there is a disable toggle for the passive or in certain content there is a spell field that disables that passive i swear they about to release challenge mode where the boss kill your first characters forcing you to put a healer in th slot to revive the rest of your characters and if you dont have castorice rip your characters and it will absolutely brick any guide makers and recomended team comps team comps imagine a comp only works with castorice passive and without it it wont work,NEGATIVE,0.9953446984291077,0

bruh castorice revive is just insurance to be clear it doesnt help you better when you play in any mode characters after resurrecting they can still die next turn if not healed or shielded afterwards so sustain still has an irreplaceable role,NEGATIVE,0.9837856888771057,0

if you dont like it just dont pull her its not a must its a choice for me that was just lore wise passive many people want lore wise character they made one and players still fxxking complain if you think it a must have youre just dont like to play hardly as other player that seriously without even getting meta characters you build whatever you want and paypull for whatever you want just shut the fxx up toxic if you dont want to pay to get hersupport hoyoverse youre just someone that same as feminist that want equal rights even though work lazier equal right only for peoples that do equal things not for fxxing people that always complain,NEGATIVE,0.9976394176483154,0
well yeah if the revive was not global its still pretty good but the fact that even you bench castorice and you just have her in your inventory makes it op just waiting to activate the passive,NEGATIVE,0.9952020645141602,0
i find it weird that people think this forces you to pull for her no it doesnt as an fp you will be perfectly fine if you dont have this global passive which isnt even good tbh if you genuinely feel forced then that means youre either terrible at building your characters and cant clear anything or you just have a gambling addiction maybe this does set a precedent for global passives yes but until we see what another one looks like im not complaining at all,NEGATIVE,0.9918249845504761,0
acheron also makes endgame content easier by skipping the battle and instantly kills enemies yet no one seems to complain about it since her debut,POSITIVE,0.9798027873039246,1
usually i would agree but gacha games are a special case since they are live service games that constantly get content updates this can easily spiral into you cant even clear the main story without broken character anymore then yes it would be pw obviously the chance of that happening is pretty low but never say never hoyo isnt very good at balancing and they already had to nerf main story bosses in the past because casuals couldnt clear them,NEGATIVE,0.9925599098205566,0

idk i never fought them prenerf fact is the bosses were too hard for a lot of people or else hoyo wouldnt have nerfed them theres a lot of factors playing into the difficulty sunday was immidiately x easier when you had aventurine on your team for example idk what counts as account being pure ass for you,NEGATIVE,0.9940218329429626,0

britishraidenshogun idk if you meant to tag me but i didnt say anything about it being strong in fact you could probably infer i think it isnt super powerful from the fact that its a revive with an extra step,NEGATIVE,0.990544319152832,0
thats what fu xuan has,POSITIVE,0.9930379986763,1
britishraidenshogun its not because of the revive a lot of people think its because of her having a global passive that hoyo will use more and more in the future and using that as a new selling point for characters power creeping old characters and making you feel stupid for pulling for old characters and forcing you to pull new characters again cause characters with global passives is the new meta,NEGATIVE,0.9971420168876648,0
britishraidenshogun actually it isnt imagine this alright you take a month break from hsr and you come back but issue is that the pervious banner characters give global passives to which you need to clear x content since without it the content is impossible it forces you to pull cause you will always be at a disadvantage compared to everyone who did pull for the global,NEGATIVE,0.9962426424026489,0
naxmaxjk so most people that dont want to pull her wants this global passive removed no one wants their characters weaker if they gonna pull them in the end its a mostly single player game so balance isnt really that important,NEGATIVE,0.9976702332496643,0
britishraidenshogun mean atp they should do that if they decide to keep the global trend cause then it would make it pay to win and not fp friendly,NEGATIVE,0.9985172152519226,0
britishraidenshogun also i dont think i would have an issue with it being only a team but i have an issue when its global cause it doesnt make sense since why does it have to be global there is no reason to make an impactful gameplay design to which hurts the overall experience for everyone,NEGATIVE,0.9994301199913025,0
britishraidenshogun see the problem is how many runs didnt you see that it took how much investment is in each of those characters thats where this all lays and how string does a character need to be to be relevant does a character need a passive so strong its global at this point in the game no lets be honest,NEGATIVE,0.9994650483131409,0
britishraidenshogun the problem isnt the revival its the precedence it sets for global passives whats stopping a character from having a passive global damage up for your team for the whole fight,NEGATIVE,0.9977721571922302,0
dahaoren dude people are obviously concerned with the fact there are global passives in the first place because whats stopping another character from having one thats actually gonna cause a ridiculous power spike for example attack up for your whole team for the whole battle or better yet you get energy regen every turn for everybody maybe a maximum health boost all the time are you seeing the bigger picture here this is like a year gatcha game ability thrown in at like year what or,NEGATIVE,0.991145670413971,0
i dont think global passives will be designed to be that powerful like giving attack even if it will give some buff it will probably be not as huge and there will probably be some limitations if there are way too many global passivesfor example only one global passives can be selected per team or something similar this rez for example i rarely die in even the hardest content its really not that useful and wont hurt if you dont have it if the developers dont put any limitations on that i dont think anyone will be happy i dont think they are that stupid to ruin their game completely im not that concerned about this disclaimer im just saying this is what my thoughts and expectations are not saying im going to be correct,NEGATIVE,0.9995645880699158,0
dahaoren but do you honestly think itll have a one global active at a time effect restraint in the first place would be them restricting this effect to just while shes on the team and even if it doesnt whats stopping this from becoming something like future characters on field ability to be permanent to the team is slots and not the characters so you can essentially always have their ability trigger while not having them on the team this just feels like a slippery slope for no real benefit especially cause people always complained about moc so now the question of scaling comes up and thats a whole nother can of worms cause if you make more than one global and multiple can be active how do you balance it for the haves and have nots,NEGATIVE,0.999575674533844,0
its a gacha game you just dont balance it,NEGATIVE,0.9968026876449585,0

livingwarrobots it becomes pay to win when they scale enemy stats to the point that the only logical way to get through the stat sticks is to forgo the sustain and go allin on damage with risking it all on rng with an additional turn using the passive for the final stretch unlikely to happen but worst case scenario there is possibility of the situation reaching that point with the power creep where you need that additional investment to keep up pay to win isnt a matter of single or multi player at all it is about whether you can actually clear the content with what you are given for free,NEGATIVE,0.9994825124740601,0

what are you even talking about is english your first language what ive said has nothing to do with what youre saying what ive said is facts and proven since day in genshin and years plus hoyo makes problems then sells the solution thats how you make money its basically a scheme they make billions and people dont care well they do now isnt it obvious every char they released was towarded moc or abyss thats the problem they sell the character as a solution do i have to explain something so basic why do you think they make billions next global passive is moc for lore reasons its not out of the possibility its prob like chance theres a pattern if you didnt even see because youre smooth brained archeron passive kills enemies without fighting next glbal passive instant revive again something so basic you couldnt see it coming,NEGATIVE,0.9984002709388733,0
ogbobbyjohnson actually no ive been playing for a while now year and im an fp player ive played genshin zz and hsr in all of these games i only pull for the characters i like whether theyre op or not ive also built lots of star star standard teams which have cleared endgame content iust fine when built properly ive almost never completely die to a boss either so maybe next time instead of assuming someones experience with a topic think clearly before running your mouth or keyboard in this case also getting steller jades and polychromes have been fairly easy for me zz being the easiest i should show you my account for that one also it seems like youre projecting none of what you said proves that castorice is a must pull you will do fine without her i promise,NEGATIVE,0.9906444549560547,0
yeah honestly global passives will not matter unless you really plan on cycling moc which doesnt matter in the slightest im guessing this is a one time thing as the anniversary character for the patch but nobody can truly tell until we actually see it somewhere else so no more complaining just waiting is all we can do before making real statements,NEGATIVE,0.9987956285476685,0

maybe cause you actually need to have her equipped not to mention its really limited and drains technique points they also limited in the su by making items in conundrum nonexistent so you have to really savor points castorice on the other hand is a free restrictionless revive across your entire account just for having her it would be a different story if having acheron allowed all characters to insta kill enemies regardless of her being on the team but thats not the case is it,NEGATIVE,0.9976994395256042,0

the vast majority of the players which are casuals from what i heard doesnt really care about the whole situation and its mostly the vocal minority or hardcore players of this game that is complaining its not like the passive itself is broken because she does drain hp of your allies which balances it out but rather it will set a bad precedent for future characters of this game like global crit dmg or speed etc if they just simply give it to castorice and not everyone else then its fine but if they implement global passives in the future it would be smart for them to give it to the mc and not premium paid characters,NEGATIVE,0.9994077682495117,0

the problem yall is that it doesnt lie within the passive its what other people think i  think her passive is already enough and can still be power crept considering that she only revives our teammates in hp instead of like at least half of hp or full but with all that aside the passive is already good enough they just have to balance it out simply by just removing the passive activating even when shes not in the team edit the patch hasnt released fully yet so making conclusions and assumptions is not good,NEGATIVE,0.9940715432167053,0

first of all this is a gacha game it was designed so that people would donate secondly crying about powercreep when you cant get jade from highgame which is difficult in purpose is kinda pathetic her global passive itself is mid many argue about this mechanic because doomposters among whom there may be wuwa fans say that in the future there will be even more characters with this feature this is just speculation and even if it turns out to be true remember acheron and her technique that allows you to skip battles with mobs and how it caused whining so what now shes still a good dd but not a must pull and if thats not enough look at hi where global passives divine keys are commonplace,NEGATIVE,0.9997307658195496,0

there are two problems the passive works even when she isnt in the team which just doesnt make sense the revive is ok if shes on the team because her play style is risky theres the possibility that future characters will get even more absurd global passive like permanent stat bonuses also it has the chance to spread not just to hoyo games but other gacha games too the severity of this can best be understood if a very widely detested character like aglaea had a global passive like spd or something essentially forcing you to consider characters you otherwise dislike edit the castorice glazers have arrived lol i just want to say pull any character you want please its the only thing stopping this game from turning into a wasteland of meta slaves a game is made not only by the devs but also the community but im afraid that a lot of people are seeing the hsr devs not fully listening to the community and a certain sect of the community defending the devs at all costs this kind of behaviour will just ruin the game in the long run and nobody wants that to happen,NEGATIVE,0.9995922446250916,0

the revive is good and all but not gamebreaking with good sustain the revive is irrelevant for the most part just like how bailu revive and huohuo revive accessed via eidolons sure you can use it without sustain and be revive for an extra turn with hp but imagine its the boss turn it downed a character in your team and it still has a turn most bosses has turn then that revived character is good as dead to answer you first question yes it doesnt make sense that she can revive even without her being on the team but dont forget that castorice will basically become a demi god in this upcomimg patch to answer your second question this global passive is probably just a one time gimmick because it will be the nd anniversary of hsr but theres also a chance that this would be a thing in the future and it up to the devs whether they want to cause more powercreeping to their game call this a copium or whatever i enjoy the game and its story is all that matters,NEGATIVE,0.9795372486114502,0

the problem here is that you keep mentioning that its forcing you to pull for the character even if you dont want to bro if thats the case the problem is yours youre forcing yourself because you feel like it if you dont like the character and it has a global passive dont go for it im sure that all the time youve been playing the game you havent had any problems getting through the endgame,NEGATIVE,0.9970716238021851,0

yes there are i doesnt really know who is the leaker but if you want to know you can watch homuboy sorry if the name was wrong but they dont use english he mentioned about the future global buffs also phainon global buffs used to be all character can use lightcone and cyrene was used to be increase the capacity of character in a team by charateam zard,NEGATIVE,0.9896867871284485,0
and another one spectacularly misses the point acheron needs to be on the team to kill the enemies castorice doesnt need to be on the team to revive hence the entire global passive also acherons technique is much more comparable to natlan characters in genshin with all of their exploration utility doesnt do much for combat but its a nice qol thing,NEGATIVE,0.9976980090141296,0

imo its the best if the want to release global buff not from some sort of rngwall character you dont guarantee to get castorice anyway right they should add it through other way like by clearing story etc for ex in cookie run kingdom from the early update they release a feature called laboratory so you can increase your cookies power by atk hp def etc by using production resources since the game itself was an rpgcity build game for hsr i guess it can be transformed similarly to the circuit system in the divergent universe but work for all content and instead of rng type of gacha to get it it will be more grindy since hsr itself is lack of content for me,NEGATIVE,0.9992627501487732,0
silverarrow except that theres literally content in the game that doesnt let you swap to acheron to use her technique and then swap back to your actual team so its literally an account buff but more scuffed because it forces you to swap to her and castorice passive is also qol if you play sustainless then your team would stay dead because it requires healshield before the next turn if you play sustain and youre still experiencing death on your team its either a build issue or theres more concerning problem with the boss balancing so the only time where it actually matter is if youre new and only have natasha and march for sustain or rng like hoolay locking one of your team time in a row it doesnt affect what you can achieve in endgame at all beside having to restart due to bad rng,NEGATIVE,0.9990140199661255,0

rinn_qwerty cmon now we all have that one guy who will come forward and say been since st patch and all that bs whats even your point ive been seeing how the hsr community keeps growing more and more toxic and have a problem with each and everything thats being released as per you good points that the castorice haters are getting up in my view is absolute bs because that means in the long run we are only going to have character that have nothing special atall similar skill sets like what am i gonna do with characters that have instakil like acheron or running fast like feixiao this is a long term game there should definitely be stuff that makes the game easier over time for people and this stuff should be different from any existing characters global passives seem the best way to start it and the way yall make it sound is like cas is buffing cd is she no shes not shes reviving a character i can imagine to what length hsrs community stupidity would go to if the global passive was actually an atk boost or speed boost of sorts i just cannot see straight with a fandom that hates on everything and goes toxic sorry boss you may be a meta guy but im someone who plays this game to enjoy,NEGATIVE,0.99913090467453,0

makisky of course not i never said that eventually as in any live service the old characters will not be as good that is basic gaming expectations i never once expected selee to be the top tier dps for the rest of time or for gepard to be the infinite tank her was in but there is a very big difference between expecting general character balance and removal of fomo releases and expecting for every character to somehow be on the same level hsr has an hp inflation powercreeping issue with generally recent units that were released less than a year ago that already dragged some people away but this global passive is adding something on top i ask every defender here what exactly is the issue with the gobal passive being on the mc or only when castorice is on the team the answer is none at all the same goes for the future units that will undeniable have global passives in greater form because and i will say this very clearly castorices passive in itself is not overpowered dying has never been an issue in this game the issue has never been the power of castorices passive but its implementation ignoring any sort of critsism to the game state does not help you make the game better it is entirely fair for me and other to say that we do not want characters made fomo while older characters who were released less than a year ago get their kits power crept locking a global buff behind a gambling paywall is anti consumer the second a good global passive is put behind a character you dont actually want you or others who are actively defending this will start complaining only for this community to again backtrack and start defending that during the powercreep debacle this communities arguement against ccs were stop using x units when next to no one even uses them anymore then when the castorice leaks came out this community defended it by saying its beta test only itll get removed only for that to be proven wrong now we are at this point where many of you are saying oh itll only be on her with no sort of proof to even back it up if you do not believe me on any of these points go right ahead and backtrack videos on these discussions its hypocritical when do you guys stop sucking the developers cock and draw a line i seriously wonder the global passive is anti consumer end of fucking story it isnt that hard to tell it is and yet you defend it with a shield and sword in hand,NEGATIVE,0.9968060255050659,0

zard bro you just compared a mechanic best used to farm materials in overworld or su to one that applies in endgame theres a reason why acherons mechanic wasnt controversial because at best its a qol for su same for feixiaos or sparkles its pretty different you can only relate them that way if you are stupid and i think you are they are breaching the endgames with this passive and now sets a standard for the next shiny basic bth after castorice had it been outside of endgame and only when cast is in the team like every other qol mechanic in the game trust me no one will complain,NEGATIVE,0.9761162996292114,0
pepegaphone a qol is qol regardless where you use it and i can argue that simulated is also an endgame as it has repeatable content and reward and is constantly getting update but every days instead of every month like moc and it is the best place for acheron technique to use just what is the benefit of having one time revive that cant be used without sustain if you dont play sustain then your character would be dead on the next turn if you play good sustain and still dead i can assure you it is a build issue if there is a boss that is getting released and able to killed you even with good sustain then the boss are the one that is concerning so then the only time its actually matter is if an rng fked you over once every battle like if hoolay hit one character times in a row castorice passive dont increase your ceiling of your run just the way global stat boost does it just save you from restarting a run if that its actually rng chance do happen if youre concerned that this would be a precedent then i literally show you how acheron which mind you the anniversary unit is still the only one that can one shot why do you think we cant have talent for one shot elite or boss or weekly it literally doesnt matter for endgame according to you but its still a big qol right it literally the same thing as comparing castorice global buff with like cdmg or something its not comparable whatsoever you can comeback and flame me if that indeed happen but i cant see a world where they implement global buff that isnt just qol,NEGATIVE,0.9960887432098389,0

being single player doesnt suddenly make paying for power not a problem you know why do you think people get angry when assassins creed puts too much qol behind a paywall the main thing about making a global passive is that it opens up the possibility of more global passives and once you release something like a crit dmg global passive it raises the overall health pool of bosses if this was zz i would trust it a little more since their hp inflation is very low but hsr has shown time snd time again theyre willing to make bosses ultra tanky to non new characters btw i dont play hsr anymore so i am only going by what others say but theres a reason why i dont play it anymore these days i got zz and it feels way more fair and allows me to even use corin one of the worst characters in game to clear content,NEGATIVE,0.9974682331085205,0

ronreed this is like genshin and other gacha games the more you character releases the more power crept will be because thats how the industry works seele is now irrelevant on moc without proper build and support and other og meta new characters star new meta and new meta will be broken and new enemy will tougher you cant stay at it forever because someone cant cope with it and also you are exploring new planets on every update new tougher enemy and mechanics they follow the genshin formula update or generic gacha so dont even surprise by it,NEGATIVE,0.9996687173843384,0

ronreed is a global passive disadvantage to your account,NEGATIVE,0.99955815076828,0
yeah thats real and the problem is hoyoverse is gatekeeping the characters with rng and rerun system i know play a game with worse powercreep the rarity system is basic one common rare epic legendary and everytime a new legendary released the last legendary character is demolished from the meta but the dev gives enough rewards from farming mail events etc for the player to get the characterwhat i mean is the character is free so the garage system rate up one is have a guarantee to get the rate up character at pull but the dev makes fp can reach that amount and its not that hard for newer player its still considered as hard for me thats why this game is not really noob friendly and the normal legendaries are mostly free even they added an event not anniversary when you streak login for days you can choose one of all the legendaries that already released at that time for free even they added a perma event where we can choose ancient a rarity that above legendaryfor each phase theres total of phase wich mean ancients out of ancients but hoyoverse doesnt do the same they make the gacha more harder while making the powercreep insaner for me its only one step away to reach the powercreep of that game ive played the game name is crk its just an abbreviation its kinda popular now so im sure theres a lot of people recognizing this game nowadays silverstar,NEGATIVE,0.9958212375640869,0
cloudchaser so because of it you chose to cry about this on the internet,NEGATIVE,0.9951233267784119,0
silverstar its actually the same already do you see klee as in dps on the spiral abyss like eveyone can do that or even worst fremi physical dps what i meant is the more games update the more it gets harder little by little so i didnt suprised because thats how gacha game works lol,NEGATIVE,0.998933732509613,0
anikun_ i am also not surprised but like genshin is very different with their spiral abyss th floor difficulty thats literally the one and only thing that they make it total bullshit and hard meanwhile the entire game story archon quests everything that you need to do to complete the games content beside the abyss can be easily beaten with any character including klee honkai star rail meanwhile already started its insane difficulty spike when that boss that came with ruan mei was launched every update a new boss comes that will be so difficult that the single character they launch in that version will be needed to pass trough it unless they make casual mode even more casual as i heard that they made this casual mode so ppl can pass trough the story,NEGATIVE,0.9987384676933289,0
silverstar the problem is the whale will whine again or meta slave savers goldfish spender or mihoyo wants some cash its no in between i dont know whats their cooking but all games have recently hard for me as fp they burning the kitchen if this thing continues which is definitely are and about klee you cant beat the last spiral abyss and now because the given health on boss and elite enemies are insane also the infuriating part that only natlan characters can benefit on the buff last time spiral abyss so in the end they are definitely the same spiking there and that also zz the last event i didnt even beat it its like mihoyo wants u to be whale or fish for some reason,NEGATIVE,0.9992290735244751,0
anikun_ again you repeated the same thing that i said we shouldnt focus on when comparing the powercreep between hsr and genshin you are indeed correct with everything you said but i am trying to point out how hsr is being way worse with it than genshin abyss and moc have the same problem but what differentiate between genshin powercreep and hsr powercreep is the story bosses the last boss we saw can be defeated by any character or any team will struggle more than the optimal team yeah ppl will but its way easier than how much someone with only characters fight last story boss on hsr so much so hsr had to make casual mode but genshin has nothing like that,NEGATIVE,0.924922525882721,0
silverstar i said the problem is the whale is gonna whine again or mihoyo wants a spare cash to grab in thats why theres many space between it because its different sentence it means that hoyo listen on the whale or people that wants the game harder this common trend before the spikes i can solo the moc only one character on moc is there no real end game for hsr this the most i always see the thing is community ask for this then regret later,NEGATIVE,0.9985874891281128,0
silverstar and false also the thing is that spiral abyss is time dependant only one stage are health dependant which means that if you need to be good on this and wise pulling but other than that its already presence on the surface area of genshin you just didnt notice you will not get the primo if you dont have the meta in spiral abyss and if theres a new character releases automatically the buff on spiral abyss will align on that character or whatever character on that banner only x has buffs on spiral abyss that is so specific unlike before so argue with me if they arent milking both games including zz using difficulty spike and character gimmick lock stage,NEGATIVE,0.9966802597045898,0

pillowhead and there is the problem just cause you think its okay doesnt mean it is okay its still a problem and you just ignored the point of what it means for the potential future if you cant actually acknowledge the broader situation then let me out it like this if you are a new player good luck if you are a returning player too bad your characters are outdated and unless you have the relics given to you by the hand of god best of luck and with global passives its gonna get to the point where unless you have a specific character you are always gonna be at an immediate disadvantage and with the constant meta changing the awful hp inflation the so called class roles being completely irrelevant now it doesnt set a good example and using the excuse of well others games its bad and they have pvp is literally a terrible scapegoat excuse cause its still a problem so trying to deflect just shows you are aware of it and just dont want to acknowledge if what you say is true then why is the star rail community actually uniting and saying this isnt a good thing and they really need to rethink this over and not been happy with her current state of the game recently,NEGATIVE,0.9993508458137512,0
