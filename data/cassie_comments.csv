"they clearly felt the cold water, during beta anaxa had a global passive that gave like +3 lvls to basic attacks to EVERYONE but after people complained they removed that one and left cas'"
"After playing the story, I still think the global passive didn’t have to exist. 

While Castorice does go through her arc to understand the value of life & death and save the TB. That’s it. She even says it’s a one time exception for our TB. So having a revive as an in-game global passive is still a weird choice. It could been really funny if it only worked for TB."
"It is broken, as the reason most showcases achieve 0 cycle in Moc will likely be due to the global passive saving their sustain less team.."
Being self-aware that you sound like a hoyo shill doesn't stop you from sounding like a hoyo shill
"I don't really mind the passives even if they are global, if I can't pull the character I'm not going to bankrupt myself just to get the character. Anything that can help my skill issue or survivability is a welcomed addition, but I can see why other players see this as a bad thing, some people have poor financial thinking and try to get them anyway."
"I'm not having Castorice and paying more attention to situations where her passive whould have saved my run, happens frequently
I play sustainless a lot, there are teams which lack for example exact one additional turn, or there are a lot of healing machanics in apoc now, so her passive really influences overall account results, I'm pretty sure people with castorice on acc have overall better results couse it is really much more doable to play sustainless with her, I'm already feeling the diff between me and Castorice havers, and what if it worsens with the other global passives?"
Hoyocuck CC
The furthest it should go is affecting the opposite half in endgame 2party modes only if castorice is deployed in one
"i don't think they will do it again, most than anything because they didnt label it as global, if they wanted to make it a thing they would've labeled it properly"
Hoyo is a business and the game is easy enough to clear without global passives. It's weird to complain about this in a single player game. Just pull on the characters you like and you'll still be fine.
"ok this comment section is really starting to bug me. no matter what you say a single revive a battle will never be op, if you need it you are likely to weak to do the end game any way even with the passive."
I was wondering what a globle passive was. So if it's just a char can do things while not on the team then I don't think that's bad. Meta wise it's broken but this game has no PVP. So it's not really breaking anything. BUT. this game has terrible balancing of new enemies and constantly add new mechanics that older players or none meta players aren't going to have fun. The whiplash I got when I got silverwolf who was deem broken just to come back now to find out I'll need every new buffer or some sort of follow up something to do enough damage just to beat some multiplying bug or scorpion thing and watch my units fail to even do half the dps these new ones do will always mind boggle me.
Global passive is good as long as they don’t balance enemies with them in mind. This should just be a nice little bonus to players who have characters with a passive and not as an excuse to make bump up the powercreep even further
"Here is my take:
- I cannot finish my current MoC 12 with Adventurine or Fu Xuan on the team, I got blown up and my tank are both E0S1.
- You can say that I do not a good build, but I counter it that the timing of this global passive and definitely suspicious.
- Nothing... NOTHING, aside from profit, stopping from Hoyoverse giving us Castorice for free.
- I too am looking forward other characters, especially 4 star character with global passive.  Now, how long do we need to wait?  Are they as strong as 5 star global passive?"
"Passive is good, people need to leave the game if they don't agree."
"EVERYONE knew that Castorice would be ridiculously powerful, the global passive seems like Hoyoverse's self fulfilling prophecy. Wouldn't be surprised if they pull a ""Castorice's banner was successful, so this means players are ok with global passives"" out of their ass. A global passive is inherently scummy, I'm surprised you're defending it."
"I didnt really follow anythign about castorice so im surprised this was a thing but also man, I just want dragon but probably not gonna get bc I just mydei e1"
"Revives are bad because they take up power budget on something that shouldn't even come up. When trying to ride the line of lategame damage pushing, having a free ""you don't need to budget for this revive you just get it"" is dramatic and I think this is going to be looked at as the moment HSR's powercreep became exponential."
"The way the devs are treating Castorice is kinda making me dislike her, and it really isn't the character's fault."
"I agree with you and i expect that this is a one thing with Castorice or that if other characters have a global passive is a small one (Like more money at the end of the battle, or the enemy does'nt detect you in the overworld) and does'nt break the game, but if i see that a new character comes out and have a really game changing passive (more atk, crit, spd, etc) i will be the first one to truly be mad about it, and yes i know that according to the leaks phainon supossesdly will have a global passive but lets not forget that leaks are not always right, straight up lies or just ideas that came up during the creation phase of a character that ends up being eliminated (lets not forget that we had leaks of screwllum being playabel since 1.X, and it not in the game yet), but i do think that we should raise or voice and say loud and clearly that we just want this to be a one time thing or that the passive will be small and does'nt really affect combat in a significant way

Besides i think that the backlash that the game is recieving will tell Hoyo that we don't want this global passives or that if ends up being included then all the characters need to have global passives (example: all destruction characters have +5% break effect, all hunt +5% crit rate, etc) and you can only active a small amount at the same time(like 3 or 5 at the same time)

For the moment i will be kepping a close eye in what Hoyo wants to do and acting accordingly"
"Even with Castorice's revive, you'd still be death in MoC 12. Both sides attack very frequently and she rezz you back with 1 HP or 1% HP."
"You are under the assumption I never cleared it, and I did eventually.  I do need to figure out how to clear the second half, and it's annoying now I need to try more times than usual

I also cleared it on Beta too, with Castorice and possibly Mydei separately.  I either use Mydei + tribe, or Anaxa + Castorice, but not all 4.

Hoyoverse is not dumb, they don't release characters with useless global passive, especially 5 star.

We used to talk about how 5 star is optional, and I bet you can still make this argument too.  Because SOMEWHERE someone can still clear it using only 4 star, not me and I don't have this much time."
"I think the problem with this passive is, for me personally, is that it's just another giant thing on the pileup of things that make me feel like Hoyoverse doesn't respect me as a player.  It's not even just HSR, my view towards Hoyo has soured so significantly through their choices with Genshin, and now it feels like it's been happening a lot in HSR... it's just.. I'm tired man!  I don't even want to play ZZZ because even though currently there's nothing really wrong with it I just don't trust Hoyo anymore.  And Castorice's passive is just like.. man they got so much feedback about how it's great when she's on the team but don't make it global and they just once again ignored everything.  I feel very slighted and I no longer wish to play their games.  Which sucks!!  Because I DO still think they're the best when it comes to character visual design and music.  I'm not qutting HSR yet... but I'm truly on the fringe now.  It's the last Hoyo game I still actually play and honestly I don't know how much longer I will enjoy it for"
"not the end of the world- YET. they designed the UI and mechanics, they will probably release more. they're testing the waters, and given hoyo's track record, it will continue regardless of feedback if it ends up being good for profit. even if the worst for this doesn't happen, there's still so many other issues that have yet to be resolved, and they do not communicate that they intend to solve any of them. i love this game, but it's so hard to play and enjoy"
Global passive is not stupid. You will understand after playing the story...
"I’m afraid they will remove the third condition to perfect clear MoC with: clear it with less than 28 cycles remaining 

Because technically by introducing this, if you have castorice and a healer, it’s almost impossible to die."
"people are so caught up with bs that everyone is losing focus on the things that really MATTER

1) doesn't matter if HSR or any game in existence is MOBA, PVE, PVP, SIngle player, or what-fucking-ever; matter of fact is that every game has rules and mechanisms that differentiate it from other games and maintains the structure and enjoyment of a game. HSR HAS BROKEN ITS OWN RULES OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU TAKE IT, HOYO HAS FUNDEMENTALLY BROKEN HSR'S MECHANIC WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION OR REASON. Again, it doesn't matter if you're okay with or not or you're a hoyo-hater or a shil. Objectively, in an equation, HSR's formula has received changes and now it is unbalanced. It is fundamentally flawed now and yes that's a bad thing. If you're okay with it, good for you. But if there's a problem, it should be addressed despite who feels like what about it.

TL;DR if you're not happy with HSR, it's fine, if you're not happy, that's also fine. Because the real matter at hand is that Hoyo has altered the rules of game unjustly and that's the real issue (weakness break, weakness implant, global passive). Not how we feel or think


2) It isn't really the fact that global passives alone are an issue (even though they should be), the real issue is that Hoyo has been dragging HSR down for months now. We've lost so much faith and have been fed so much shit that we can't help but feel like the game will just get worse even though that has yet to happen. I don't like to be pessimistic just for the sake of it but I can't look back at Hoyo's track record and back them up. And it shows in the community. Yes people are going bonkers over the global passive even though they shouldn't (at least not yet) but the fact of the matter is that most people are frustrated and just hope for the worst every time a change is implemented. I'm not talking about doomers or baiters but just genuine normal players.

TL;DR people's outrage is justified since Hoyo has been giving us nothing bad changes for almost a year now and people are just acting out naturally. There's really nothing to complain here because that's just how people would react if all they are getting are bad news; they'll exaggerate the issue and brace for impact.


3)All this doesn't matter. Because Hoyo will get away with it. Unless people collectively move over to next big thing after gacha or something just take Hoyo by storm or something drastic and unforeseen happens, there will always be people who'll take whatever Hoyo gives. Doesn't matter who these people are and why they do it but the majority will always take it. I myself am playing the game so I'm no one different. So unless the world becomes a perfect system, we're going to get whatever Hoyo will serve.

TL;DR Hoyo will do whatever they want and we'll take it. Unless something overtakes Hoyo, we'll be just subjected to this."
i was never so quick to look away when the animations appeared)
"1:35 Correction, your unit will not die again. While your units are under the effect of her passive, they are immune to death until healed, shielded, or the auto-death two turns later. So many people overlook this fact and is why her passive is actually pretty op and is a problem to be global (among the other problems of it being global).

Also, need I remind people of the clip where Hoolay 0-cycled a full team? You can't do anything in that situation. Having Castorice there means you don't get 0-cycled and get another chance to actually win, espeically when the revived characters are immune to death for two turns. She's going to become essential so that things like that just don't happen."
2:26 because they're greedy. Its that fucking simple
"I honestly dont have an issue with it

My team is focused around tanking, surviving and such, i use Gepard, Natasha, Firefly and preservation TB, but im also building up Bailiu currently

This global passive fits right into what im aiming for for my 
Team

Shields

And just being really hard to kill lmao"
It’s not the end of the world but I probably is the beginning of the end
"Finally, someone who isn’t acting like it isn’t the end of the world and knows the sense behind it"
"Yours is genuinely the only normal response to this I've seen. Like I get it. I get that hyv probably doesn't have a good track record in people's eyes. But the hypotheticals are getting annoying. They previously stated they liked making the anniversary characters super strong or something like that. It may never exist in another character, or if they do I doubt they will mess with stats because people speed tune etc their characters in this game and that would affect too much. I also agree that Mydei's forced auto is way more of a problem since it fully affects the way the player actually plays (ahem, or can't play) the game.

I saw many claim that Mydei being uncontrollable ""makes sense"" because of (spoiler for 3.1) gaining the power he did. I think this is a poor argument because throughout the end of the quest, he remains entirely reasonable and in control. He only implies a future loss of control and only ever alludes to this intense fury when in Phainon's version of the trial and Nikador is egging him on. (even in his own for the trailer he got, he didn't actually look out of control ever...)

(Also, Jingliu and Bladie should also be uncontrollable retroactively then!) 

Castorice's ability implies that during this patch she very well might get the coreflame of death, which would mean she lowkey controls who lives or dies. If we really go deep into the lore you can think of it like

Castorice is a kind person, and wouldn't want us or our friends to die. But because balance is required for life and death, she can only revive to 1hp and if they're ""meant"" to stay alive, preservation or abundance will protect/heal them. Otherwise they still die and the balance of death continues. I say this because even if she's kind, I think she very well understands that people and things do need to die eventually. 

It seems that starting with Mydei, they really wanted to go for ""lore abilities"" for their kits to a new level. I mean, everyone complained about Mydei's auto feature before he was released and even after; every post related to him was full of comments to remove it before release. Especially because they only avoided mentioning it in the English stream! Honestly I think this decision is worse for him because at E6 you can only control his ult, which is a bummer for people like me who never play on auto. It's such an odd choice when we already had characters this would apply to and they don't have anything like this. It's interesting from a design choice but poor from player experience perspective. It's a glorified followup attack (godslayer be god specifically) that isn't treated as one.

Anyway for Castorice too, I think it's interesting from a design perspective, but even though I personally do not mind it because this is a single player PvE game, the largely negative reaction shows that from the player perspective, it's a poor choice. My real question is why don't the others (Aglaea, Tribbie, Anaxa) have something in their kit that is like this? A possible drawback / something related to their lore that impacts the way their kit works. I guess they might be harder to think of stuff for but still, that part seems imbalanced to me.

I'm not gonna get on my high horse about ""it sets a bad precedent"" because it's their game and they can do what they want. ""They'll think they're allowed to do this again!"" It's their game. ""What if they put an insane GP on a character you hate"" I will never pull for a character I do not like. They may never do another GP again, and fearmongering for the hypothetical future GPs being ""required"" when we don't know where else this may take us is a bit much for me. I get why people are worried about this hypothetical, but even Castorice's doesn't look required, so idk why people are saying not having these characters will brick their accounts. The lack of 4*s with good kits is bricking the game way more than this imo, because you have few to no alternatives for the abundance of limited 5*."
"If you are one of those ""slippery slope"" people who genuinely believes that Castorice's global passive means we are getting Crit/ATK% global passives in the future. Just quit now; you will save yourself time and money in the long run."
"Its not the end of the world, its the start of the end of the word"
"It's literally just a revive. 99% of the times your healers / shielders will be able to outheal / outshield most damage, unless you aren't a late game player. The issues will come when they release global passives that are actually useful"
"I agree with you, I played GI since 1.0 and spent about $250 on that game, but I stopped because I didn't have time to play and the story wasn't good anymore

Don't force yourself to play a game you don't like, no matter how much money you spend, because there is something more valuable than money, which is your time, spend your time doing what you like, time will never come back"
Tbh her passive is not tahtbgood anyways but i am more worried that they might give crit or other buffs in future charas which i hope they dont. Otherwise i think its quite good. I wont mind if they keep it limited to anniversaey cahras but still i hope they dont since powercreep is already bad. And ngl people will pull even i wanna just cuz she is crazy cool asf. Dragon purple psychthe 😭😭😭
Seeing feixiao miss so many crits in the background gameplay hurts
The people on the live stream talking calmly as if they not gonna do worse it pmo
"Ngl, if HSR want to really sell a character that isnt overpowered they can.. by incorporating proper characterization to the character (refined face animations during dialogue, high quality model, impactful and memorable part in the story etc), I don't know if Hoyo is just blind and deaf but most people will whale if the character have interesting traits rather than their kit being broken. 

But what do players expect, Hoyoverse being Hoyoslop they are pushing this extreme laziness that they had and induce FOMO in a global passive instead (literally generating money through wall of text instead of putting effort to actual story content). If Castorice sells well,  this just sets a precedent to Hoyo that being lazy is okay, and they can milk their players whenever they want.

And saying that it would be a problem once they added combat related global passive is just not it. Do people not realize how Silver Wolf sets a precedence to characters applying weakness break whenever they want, or Acheron having broken multipliers that DPS units after her became absurdly broken as well. Why do people still think that this won't be a problem if they already did it the second time? What... the saying ""fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice, shame on you"" is not enough, people still want Hoyo to fool them thrice, holi Hoyo players are sadistic af."
"This definitely isn't true, cause I just did AS and had a character die against the bugboss, get revived, and then die immediately afterwards by another minion bug rofl."
"@marksmanmax1158  Yeah, Hoyo chose very poor wording with the description. It suggests they wont die, but thats not the reality."
"Yes, global passive is not game breaking right now. It will be a problem later down the line.

However, dont let that distract you from the very real problems right now. Story presentation is still bad, powercreep is still running rampant, and why do we have to wait til 3.4 for the buffs?"
"It was never about the revive thingy, or other additional stats it gives. The main problem was the idea of global passive itself. Most player think that's its alright, since the effect it gives is minimal, w/c is true but it's shouldn't be look based on Castorice herself. It should be look collectively. This gives the precedent to release units w global passives. It's wouldn't be done consecutively, but slowly. Hoyo isn't dumb, they're testing waters"
It's bad practice lol
its weaker than the su rez  blessing its really not that big nor never meant more than a safety net for sacking a crap ton of hp for the hp units they made. dont wanna get players to spend their money on a risky playstyle and not have them like it due to the requirment per atk esp if they cant keep up early on. Image needing this buff outside of hp draining teams thats when you gotta look at your shitty team and ask why did i die in the 1st place.
"Personally I disagree with a few points. 

Even if the devs are going to be making future global passive buffs but they're miniscule like say a very minor stat buff of 5% attack increase, these can all stack and the devs will factor all of these global buffs into their endgame content and possibly even future characters kits and balance it around them. Which of course makes the HP inflation and powercreeping even worse than it is.

To also tell players that feel they have been disrespected by the game to just quit is terrible advice. Because that is not going to change the game for the better or make it improve. This is only good advice to those that feel HSR has crossed a line and they can't continue with it anymore, and you should have phrased that better. 

Additionally saying that Hoyo could have ruined the game at any point by adding  predatory pay to win mechanics because they know can get away with it and saying the passive ""worth stressing over"" is incredibly short sighted and not providing any solutions to the powercreep situation. 

Not to mention, considering Hoyo is seen to be the top mobile gacha company that every other gacha game is striving to take even a 10% of their profits, whose to say this wouldn't trickle down to future gacha games and become a trend? And before anyone says that those games would be EoS'd... After Genshin's release, there started having an influx of copycat games with the similar concepts and copy pasting the relic system with its shitty layers of rng which many players complained to be a shitty mechanic but now its a trend. 

Last of all, what if those global passives introduces some unbalanced mechanic unrelated to stat increases but still affecting combat gameplay? Its definitely possible. Lets assume this: ""When insert _ is in the team, increase hits on every ally's ultimate attacks by 2"". Meaning Acheron's ult for example would be doing 6 attacks on her ult instead of her usual 4. Its still a terrible precedent to set because it opens up way too many bad mechanics that can break even more of HSR's rules."
"Ya,it could open the door for hoyo to implement a game defining global passive,but have they done it yet?will they do it?Then complain after they show signs of it being taken."
"the thing is not the passive effect.Its the global passive in general. Do we have the urgency that we really need this?No we dont. So with this in mind,hoyo need to balance powercreep,hp inflation and possible global buff.Good luck hoyo.And for the casuals defending this,make sure you guys dont rage quit for the difficulty spike because the spike will happen and not just end game content.Expect the same for story too.And good luck on teambuilding too.This buff alone kinda breaks the team composition and value of sustains.Who need sustain when you have this passive?And for the accounts that dont have castorice,well sucks to be you..."
"It's like Myrtle from Arknights, the game changes so much because of her. But the main difference is, she's a 4 star.

If hoyo in the future release a Global Passive 5 star with broken effect that changed the game, then that's a problem, unless it's a free 4 star."
"Looking forward to Phainon's 10% accountwide free crit rate and everyone with Castorice on their accounts getting hypocritically mad about it, after telling Hoyo that global passives are OK.
If they do that, you can only blame yourself and you better not complain."
"The thing that worries me is that HSR's gameplay is very simple. As they release more global passives, it will be hard to avoid either.
-Actual buff that improve a team's performance by a decent amount (they could always thread the needle but it's fucking Hoyo soooo)
- Synergy between seemingly innocuous global passives that then makes them much more powerful when you own a certain combination of characters (say Hyacine's passive gives a party wide heal whenever someone dies, which allows a character  revived by Cas passive to not die again even if you don't have a sustain).

Either way, it's introducing more potential problems when devs should be focusing on fixing existing problems. If Hoyo had accrued a good reputation when it comes to managing things that can introduce FOMO and treated players fairly overall, I would not be overly worried about this, but again, it's Hoyo. Mark my words, we'll soon see a boss that can oneshot a party member without fail unless you interact with a very annoying mechanic of said boss, and you'll watch every Cas owner just shrug it off regardless of the team they play while the others will scramble to deal with it or have to use fucking Bailu."
"Brooo having Castorice on the account will always save you from losing one star due to fallen character in MoC

It affects late game performance + associated rewards, thereby solidifying her as a must pull 

You pull or you lose has never been more true. The crazy part is that it works even when shes not on any of your MoC teams 😂"
Civil discussion Lesgoo 🗣️
"It's a global buff because she's the wife. Just kidding, I agree that she'd be perfect with just the on-field version of the same skill."
"""Blown over proportion""
It's just a horse armor
it's just skin
it's just loot boxes
it's just battlepasses
It's just 100$ for a character
it's just 500$ for a skin.

You don't understand other issues are character flaws that makes eidolon more desirable.
THIS IS MAKING CHARACTERS MUST HAVE
Because sometimes getting 1 extra turn alive means victory for weaker players and stronger players can abuse this more easily.

Castorice will suffer because of this. Because if she didn't have a global effect, she would get a lot more. This is hoyoverse they have no self control."
"I mean, it's really not out of our hands technically... that makes it just sound like you have little faith in the HSR community, which is kinda valid considering how Hoyolab is rn but atill pessemistic. 


Also, can someone save this video and send it back to him when he gets proven wrong? This video will age like milk, I am certain."
There's nothing thematic in a character based around the concept to death to revive. It is literally the complete opposite
"I would pull ONLY because of passive. She ugly and want same team as Herta, so... point like ""devs could ruin game any time"" doesnt work... them trying to ruin it right now."
"While I agree with 90% of what you said, EVERYBODY HERE is missing one crucial detail. 
The western community makes up the vast minority of the playerbase, with the vast MAJORITY of the complaints. 

If you look at the things that did get addressed and changed, it were all things that CN players complained about. Portrayel of story enhanced through animations, ""hard"" MoC (nikador mechanics are so abusable I'm sorry 😭) tackled by reducing total HP in the next one, buffs to older characters to balance out powercreep, etc.

We are not the target audience, as stupid of an arguement as it may sound. The CN players love their exclusive stuff, and if you go look at their comments about our reactions, they are mostly making fun of us xd
Their reaction to the global was also rather positive, of course with some concerned for the future, but nothing close to the wide spread hopeless doomposting we are experiencing here. 
There is obviously the big evil ""what if"" hanging in the air, and I totally understand that, but who here is actually stupid enough to think they would do that, when Madam Herta's and Acheron's techniques have more total value to your account than this global passive and some entire character kits COMBINED. And I saw NO complaints about those. If they wanted to add this into the game, or market future characters more efficiently, they got a ton of other way less controversial methods of doing that. 

The passsive is so ridiculously useless due to needing a heal otherwise you automatically die on the next turn, it's only there for flaire. 

The reason I am commenting so negatively over something so seemingly ""reasonable"" is because it's becoming really exhausting to see all this doomposting and negativity achieve literally nothing, but ruin the enjoyment of others. Trust the devs a little more, Hoyo is not a multi billion dollar corporation for nothing. And if you can't trust them because ""there is nothing to trust them for"", then don't interact with their products and quit the game, it's that easy."
"I think what's important to notice at is the way they are testing the waters by ""masking"" the passive under tons of layers. As you're saying, it's just a tiny thing in her kit, that is already so hyped, she is a highly anticipated waifu, and with some of the best animations in the game.

And I think this is Hoyo's strategy - testing the waters by attaching a passive under many, many layers of possible playerbase's defenses. ""It's a very insignificant effect, no big deal"", ""It's because of lore"", ""How dare you criticize my waifu"" - if they tested the waters by giving global passive to a character that's not desirable, people would raise pitchforks.

On top of that, it's anniversary, and they are giving lots of other things, like giving freebies, 2 free 5-stars, everything to shift the focus away from the passive. And it's clearly working.

Of course, this is a pessimistic look, but I don't know if we can trust that Hoyo won't follow through on this, to open the floodgates with Castorice where people will even defend it, and then start selling less hyped characters just on their passives.

Another reason why I'm pessimistic is that this reminds me a ton about another situation that already happened in Star Rail, that we are suffering from right now. Ruan Mei was stupidly busted even on release, raising the damage floor of pretty much all teams in the game. If you complained about her power back then, you'd be shunned - ""it's no big deal"", ""it's only the first limited harmony unit so she has to be strong"", ""it makes sense lore-wise"", ""how dare you criticize a woman that virtually touched me"", ""shut up, we're getting free 5* Ratio"". And then, suddenly HP creep happens, making not using RM feel like shit. And then Acheron happens. And then Robin, Firefly, Feixiao, Herta, waves of HP inflation... oh, and now we're complaining about powercreep? 

Powercreep wasn't a big deal either when Ruan Mei released, according to some people. Of course, does the global passive situation have to follow the same course? Not necessarily. But it can go downhill easily if they decide to, and they are clearly pushing the boundaries with this one."
"Let's play a game. Complete the phrase:

when dan heng was released, a lot of people had concerns for powercreep. What was the cope?
right, ""Oh, they won't make it worse, it's a one-off thing, or will be very rare"".

when triple banners became a thing, when it had like a BiS team. What was the cope?
right, ""Oh, they won't make it worse, it's a one-off thing, or will be very rare"".

when global passives became a thing, a lot of people had concerns. What was the cope?
.........

I stopped paying them money long ago, but I guess, instead of trying to win me over, they decided to go the very opposite way of trying to squeeze these dollars outta me. Unfortunately for them, I have self respect. Fuck this game and anything hoyo does. I have no idea how can anyone be willing to be a legit paying pig with how abhorrent this monetisation is. Little to no reinvestment into this game. They even stall the fucking multiplier buff to old characters for 3 more months, as if it's so hard. Probably right when fate collab drops, and HP meta goes out of scope so that buffed blade would be ass. Nice one hoyo, fuck you."
"You might not be a shill but you'd be a moron to think this isn't a problem. Better make a video saying you were wrong when they start adding more of these global passives. Her revive is still a literal problem. It could potentially change the way you play. Example: You find yourself in a situation where the character your controlling could die, and the safe bet would be to use SP and kill the remaining mob, but you see the potential in doing a basic to bank more SP. Thus, you basic and get the SP and die. The person with Castorice on their account has the option to snag that SP and let the character die, even if it cost SP later to get them alive it's still banking it for a time that better suits them. The person without Castorice doesn't has a bigger gamble on their hands."
"the problem isn't that the account wide passive res isn't that powerful in the current meta. yes, if you have a fully leveled and built team, then if they die in endgame content you're doing something wrong or got unlucky. the problem is if and when endgame changes to reflect the global passives (we already see this happening with the AoE meta hamstringing Hunt characters). now, you have to have the passive revive buff because there's a mechanic where the boss oneshots you, or the boss dmg numbers are so high your sustain can't keep up with it (and i mean premium sustains like aventurine and lingsha). i was and am much more worried about the global passive than something like Mydei's autobattle because his autobattle didn't actually affect his viability as a DPS in the content he's intended for at E0.

the worst part is I don't even think this will change how much money they get. the vast majority of people will still pull for the same amount of characters, but now they're forced to choose between pulling for a meta character they don't like because if they don't they won't clear endgame, or pulling for a character they loved and falling behind."
This is what I keep telling people who are doomposting over it. They won't add offensive or flat stat global passives. They are a profit company and they should know that adding those would be too greedy. They're trying to limit test to see how much they can get away with. And with recent backlash they know that global passives are not it. People are blowing it out of proportion.
"I'm a simple gacha gamer. i see unit i like, i get. i see unit i dont like, i don't get. 

But on serious note if they're gonna increase the HP at least increase the cycles or make universal gameplay mechanic's."
"I agree 100%
If global passives start to explode the powercrep even more, then its a sign that the game is over, and to turn in the towel."
yes but isnt other guy getting one as well
"yeah not the end of the world meanwhile 4 new datamined characters have global passives, oh boy oh boy sure can't wait for a global passive in between hoyo games"
Her passive is the beginning of the end
"i think makes a lot of sense, they don't even have a way to verify if worked or not in Castorice case, her banner sales would only reflect coolness of her kit and her waifu value, since a lot of people already think of her as the main waifu of the patch like they did with Firefly.

You can't test waters if this characters has an impossible rate of failure because she's the greatest waifu from Amphoreus (this is until Elsya came out).

Had they put this in someone like Anaxa, i would believe more that is a test of waters"
"Thank you, I think this ""hot take"" is way more reasonable than everyone fearmongering over a ""must-pull"" meta that hasn't even happened yet. Here's my hot take: those claiming that this will kill HSR are killing the game faster than global buffs ever will."
Its not the end of the world yet.
"No, this is exactly the beginning of the end. Don't you dare to sugar coat it by saying it's not. They, in their ENOURMOUS GREED, really said: ""How can we make more money? OH, I KNOW! LET'S DO A GENSHIN! Will this decission piss off players? WE DON'T CARE, WE WANT MONEY!"". They had 7 chances to say, ""Maybe it's not a great idea to implement this type of mechanic into a game already filled with powercreep that makes any mmo tremble"", but no. They dove head first into this decision toghether with every Castorice simp and people who don't understand that this change is beyond bad. This game already has A HUGE ISSUE with the powercreep: Units that do everything like it's a normal Tuesday, bosses with almost 10 MILLION HP by now, and no viable 4-star options besides March and Gallagher. It's so bad that they are forced yet again to bait these brainless and spinless players with a free 5-star now AND ANOTHER IN THE FUTURE! Are all of you who are defending this thing by saying, ""Oh, it's just pve, get over it"" really that idiotic? If yes, I hate to break it to you: YOU ARE IDIOTS! I just hope the EU enforces those laws against predatory monetization and knocks these types of companies down a few meters into the mud to stop. I will really want to see who is gonna spend in these games anymore when you see the prices of the pulls."
"For me, well I've already taken a long break from the game, on account of the lack of English voice acting. That said, the issue with powercreep and this global passive is incredibly worrying. I've invested so much time (and money) into this game and it's a shame to see it go down a route that seems incredibly predatory. I'm hoping you're right, and this ends up not being that big of a deal. It's just that it seems like yet another step in the wrong direction."
just make her free ez
"I strongly agree. I think it's dumb but it's whatever, it certainly won't kill the game. Much less when they've announced a LOT of very good positive changes as well that people don't focus on as much as this. They just love drama. The amount of times I've heard something was gonna kill this or that game and I was able to keep playing with no difference... Complaints are fine, I submit feedback too and devs proved they do listen. They're gonna try hard to sell you the new units? Sure, just like always. This is a business, people, but the game is far from dead. That's just clickbait."
Stop the cap
"Basically you're saying you're ok with them if they don't give you damage? I guess you're just naive thinking this is not coming. The whole time you're treating it as a theoretical. It's not a theoretical, it's innevitable. I can already see your future surprised Pikachu face when it's coming. You can keep walking the tight rope that has a big tear in the middle of it. Eventually it will snap and you will fall along with all the other shills. Better wear a big smile on your way down"
Yeah no I’m out of here
"Idk if anyone will read my comment or not, but I'm going to say it anyway.

Where HSR may go is probably the same track with HI3rd. Where powercreep is at its worst and old S ranks (5 star equivalent) characters are not only unusable but literally forgotten to the point hoyo gives them for free. It has already started with Ruan Mei and Luocha, and they will probably continue. 

For me, Global buffs are definitely broken and maybe should not be in the game and I will agree if it is the case for a game with pvp feature. The thing is, HSR is a single player game and there's literally no need for competitiveness to enjoy it. So Global buffs meant nothing but having an easier time clearing endgame contents. If you're worried about not getting every jades from MOC, APOC and PF, then get what you can and strategize your pull. No one's forcing you to pull every characters, no one's forcing you to top up, and no one's forcing you to clear every endgame content. So just do your own thing in it ans if you don't enjoy it anymore just leave it.

If you ask me, ""What if in the future hoyo releass a global buff to increase crit/spd/atk/etc? Will I pull for all of them?"" Then my answer is NO, I will not pull all of them. I will still pull only the characters I want and like. Like I said, no one's forcing you to have meta characters and you don't have to clear every endgame content. I will keep enjoy it in my own way.

I literally don't understand this drama cause why are you all worrying when you don't even need to be competitive in this game and Castorice will probably get powercreep again in the future. This is a gacha game with Honkai in its title. If you don't play HI3 then just know that the powercreep is gonna get worse. So be prepared and do your math for your pulls. Because I do, I am mostly f2p except for getting monthly once every a few couple of months so I have to calculate my pulls and truly think which character I want to prioritize. 

There's no such thing as ""A must pull character"", only a collectively agreed overpowered character that meta slave player use to compare their accounts with other to make themselves feel better for having the character. Once again, you don't need to clear endgame content. There's no rule or prerequisites that mention such thing. If you're worried about not getting enough jades, strategize your pull. It's as simple as that."
It's the beginning of the end.
People who are stupid mostly are people who get easily manipulated by blatant practices and have zero foresight ability
"Idk, this video seems kinda naive to me."
"I generally agree with this sentiment, it was an inevitability that they'd try this at some point if that was their intention, Castorice just happened to be the one they tried it on and it's not like they need to see how players will respond considering the company we're talking about. But I can't help but think if it's true they did this because it thematically fits the character, couldn't they have given this global passive as a reward for clearing the 3.2 story, like a 'Castorice's blessing' key item. That or give the character for free for those who are playing the patch to allow a more equal playing field. Tying it to if you gamble and either get lucky or invest enough to guarantee a pull sets a pretty sketchy precedent. I hope, in the event they include more global passives like this one, they're very minor things that don't provide too strong an advantage, but I doubt it."
Finally I've found someone who just don't hate hate like it ain't a big deal nor game breaking
I think there shouldn't be global effects. you either have them on the team or not. I however am not going to rage over it. have more important things to do in life.
Be careful into making videos on topics like these. I dont want the usual suspects trying to harass you over a gacha game...
"if you guys think this ""global passive"" is going o break the game what about acheron technique? or getting the herta that can make ur SU/DU experience much easier, or ruan mei that can make you recive broken rewards from her occurences those are not global buffs?, or Fei xiao that makes adventure domains free rewards without any effort?"
"I perused through the comments and it feels like 80% of the people are commenting based on the title alone. So many bring up points that were already addressed in the video. We all understand the precedent this sets, there's no need to make a comment separately pointing it out. 

The point of this is that at this very moment, the global passive is inconsequential. As this video points out, Hoyo could ruin the game even more than they already have at any point in time. These gacha devs are not benevolent saints, they do not care about player satisfaction beyond the bare minimum required to keep them hooked. If the game is no longer enjoyable for whatever reason, I urge people to quit.

At the end of the day this is a luxury entertainment product. This game is not a contractual obligation. Anyone can uninstall the game within seconds and never touch it again, and that's why I agree with this video that endlessly worrying about what could be is just needlessly exhausting. 

3:19 in the video states ""but if a new character comes out with a damage buff global passive, I'd draw the line there"" and I am in agreement. Even the most minuscule damage or stat buff, whether it be ATK%, CRIT, RES PEN or even Break Effect or Effect RES and THAT is where I'd firmly draw the line of it being unacceptable. No matter how small, a direct stat buff would be completely unacceptable and I would forever quit the game. I love min-maxing with relics and stats in this game, so the idea of a direct global stat buff from a character disgusts me.

And yes, I know about the rumors of several upcoming characters having said stat buffs as their global passives. I will be keeping an eye on leaks to see if that ends up being the case."
"To cry babies 
Cry some more about the global passives 
It makes me feel good 😊💯"
"""It's nothing special."" Yeah, about that. I thought about this for a while, and I've come to the conclusion that Hoyo can use this G. Passive to justify implementing more enemies that can 1-shot you. That might not sound bad at first, but remember, not everyone has enough money to ""guarantee"" a 5-star. That's a possible 170 pulls after all. So not having Castorice means you won't be able to complete MoC from here out, not until you get a character that can bypass BS 1-shot kill mechanics. Which they're already implementing with the new dead dragon boss, I might add. And this is going to be the new route Hoyo can take going forward. Need to make the game harder without increasing HP? Just create more global passives and reasons why you need them. Drop the copium."
"these are the kind of videos i subbed for, even if i didnt click on the video agreeing with it initially, glad ur still making vids"
❤
"yea man i need to get phainon because he gives the whole team a 50% ATK buff while not in the team or the future break support that lets you deal additional Super Break dmg.

or when a new 5* March appears her passive makes enemys freeze every 3 turns"
Global passives will not be good for new players who want to play in the future. Their account will be at a huge disadvantage compared to accounts that have 5+ global passives stack on their account
Thank you. Finally someone understands the situation clearly. Thank you for explaining this matter as simply as possible
"saw this in HI3. seeing this in HSR.
co incidence? i think not!"
"I don't think anybody was complaining about the revive itself, it's just that the games meta will become solely dependent on global passives. I am of the belief that if something happens once, it will happen again. So I don't think Hoyo is never going to this again even if the ENTIRE player base are severely against it."
No this is 100% about revenue and not at all about lore. The devs are definitely thinking if HI3 can get away with it then why not HSR? Unfortunately CN doesn't seem to mind the way that global does and therefore I see them pushing this further in the future. The game has honestly been on a nose dive trajectory for a while now and if they don't make an effort to turn it around soon I might just quit. I've already decided I'm going f2p because of the Castorice situation. Not that they'll miss my $5 per month but hopefully there are enough quitters and sudden f2p's to make them notice.
"See Gacha smack already talked about this brother. It's not a matter of ""oh it's just a revive and it'll leave you on 1hp so it's not that strong"", it's a matter of if you accept and allow them to push this bull through, next time it can be something actually more game breaking; for example, we could be getting ""implant same-type weakness on all enemies when one enemy has a weakness implanted"", ""follow-up attacks deal X% more damage"", ""when allies consume hp with their skills, consume X%/X flat amount of hp once more"", ""when skill points are consumed, increase damage dealt by X%"", or something like ""increase crit rate by 20%"", as global passives. Power creep will get even worse than it already is, which is saying a lot."
"I'm with you on this one. I'll wait for the real reason to quit this game. I mean people complained during Acheron's banner that it could have a bad precedent, but even at 3.X she's still the only one with a mob killing skill. If they ever introduce a game-breaking global passive that would ruin the game for me, then yeah I''ll easily drop this game, but for now I'm still enjoying the game."
"My main reason for not liking global passive is the fact that it feels like an insult to previous emanators 🥹. Like, there is no lore reason why those 2 shouldn't get a global passive if Castorice is getting one. 

It feels super 🫠 especially since the lack of lore reason allows Hoyo to spam global passive if they so wish... which sucks 💀

For emanators, it is very likely that we'll get them based on paths without emanators currently (since they heavily really on same path characters right?) so that's one level of safety. Combine this with the fact that they are... THE MOST GIFTED PEOPLE IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE second only to Aeon, like they'll be rare for sure, and no one would question why an emanator is so game breaking cus they always are anyways.

Tbh there isn't even that big of a reason to release Herta on 3.0(?) apart from the fact that she needs to be there before Tribbie and Anaxa, idk. Couldn't they have changed thigs up 🥹. I'll be more accepting if it makes sense why a character is OP and not just ""oh we like this waifu and we want to push her to be the center of attention""

I like Castorice's design but the way they did her kit makes it feel like they want to desperately shove her into peoples face without any based reason... Like Blade also has a part of an Abundance emanator... you definitely gonna give him Castorice's global passive when buffing him right, dev 😊

Anyways, nice vid! Sorry for being a Hoyo hater 😅"
Yep. People are just exposing themselves for not paying attention to the video and getting rewarded because this community wants to fearmonger people for choosing to look at this situation with nuance and not complete negativity
E R E C T
It should just be unusable in end game mods
"It would be great if they implemented an option to use or not use the global passives, so you can decide which ones do you prefer or if you don't want to play with those passives"
ALL i can say is hoyo likes cas ass
people are just freaking out its nothing surprising. hsr players are hypocrites for not wanting powercreep but then doomposts when one is too weak
I bet 1 Bladillion dollars that this video won't age well
This community is always blowing things out of proportion. I'm just gonna play the game and keep it moving.
"Don’t underestimate star rail players. They’ll somehow see one slippery slope fallacy and dismiss the amazing things we’re getting for 3.2 as cover ups, because they can’t enjoy anything.

Regardless though, great take. Enjoy the good, deal with the bad when it’s actually here."
Glad i quit when Fugue came out so i don't have to be a part of this circus called Hoyoverse
that not the problem it's the door for more of those global passives later that could be worse
This idiot thinks he’s above the rest 😂😂😂
"""It should be a one time thing for Castorice and it was added for lore reason""

Even if this was true ( which I highly doubt it ), they didn't need it to make it a global passive, or they didn't need it to make it active in the end game content.

Also, about future characters  not having global passive, sorry but yeah this is just wishful thinking.

Spoiler leaks





- Saber for the Collab and Phainon, where leak to have a global passive"
"Never understood why y'all are hating on this. ""Oh but it's predatory"" The game still has to make money. You're still gonna play it, and if you're not, why not stfu. It's just an arguably dumb debate. If you really hate it, just quit. Go to a more generous game like Limbus company"
"this is not just about her passive, never was"
"Bro summed up my whole opinions on this in 6 mins, for u to be that mad abt a passive being in the game, u either are doing this as ur job, or u rlly don't have much going on in ur life"
"Next Global Passive will be 1% and ""worthless"" until you get used to the idea of global passives and then incrementally end up at 5% or 6% and by then the argument will be ""if you've been playing HSR for this long you should already have enough of a cumulative global passive that surpasses 5% so it's really not that big a deal. Plus, it's only 5%"". 

So yeah, it's a big deal. They'll just keep incrementally cranking the heat like they always do. Agreed with the message of the video. Just quit if you want. Sunk cost fallacy is NOT worth it"
"honestly a welcomed passive cuz when fighting the weekly feixiao boss with aventurine or gallagar on auto, somehow a character will die every 2 runs"
But it's the start of the doom
"It's weird that any people who are not responding to it as badly are praised and being said as reasonable. Always a big logical fallacy in the gacha community.

People are responding to it badly because of hoyo themselves, treating the players as bad, which wouldn't happen if they treat us better. And it's not about Castorice's passive, but it's about how rule-breaking it is while not being necessary at all. What else are trying to do with it? Squeeze people's money, they're not even trying to improve gameplay or create another strategy, this mechanic is pure braindead. 

If you don't trust me just play the game and see it for yourself in the long run."
I felt better after this
"The reason why global passive is so problematic is that it requires no skill in this supposed strategy game, and HSR is already very limited in strategy. It will become a collect and buy game, removes all sense of strategy and make the game unbalanced. In the long run, the game will just become strictly a character check game.

Global passives are also flexible enough so the devs can break any rules they want to fit their predatory marketing."
"I find it hilarious that whenever the devs of Mihoyo do something that is clearly will cause problems in an objective viewpoint, the “community” will bend over backwards trying to defend it.

We’ve seen time and time again in Genshin, and some of the players ran to HSR because of it, and now the very same players are ok with this? 

Because “Genshin Could Never” effect?

HSR is on its way to become possibly worse than Genshin now because of the potential pitfalls of global passives.

And soon, ZZZ will be on the next chopping block."
"The thing is that power creep is getting very very bad in hsr and while this may not be an issue, the future characters are gonna make it even worse(since this has just become a contest between chars on who can do the most outrageous and stupidly op thing)"
"I feel like this is one of the few responses to this whole debacle that's been measured and reasonable.

While everyone is panicking for no reason."
"Nah dude, it's bad no matter what you say."
You have very narrow minded Thinking if you're only thinking about Castorice's global passive instead of looking at the Big picture.
"It's not the fact that Castorice's Global passive is not the end of the world, it's the fact that Global passive now exist in the game and In future, there will more Global passive characters, now Imagine in the future, Buffs are getting stacked over each other from multiple characters."
"I wish these doom poster can just quit the game and shut up, Genshin constantly get backlash but after 5 year still top 5 revenue every month, their opinion is useless, they start to sound like those dumb SJW on X, maybe they are the same ppl lol"
I would accept global passive if every character including released ones get one and they dont have significant impact on gaming. But i don't think this is the direction we are going toward.
"Buddy, they made a unique icon and everything for it. They are 100% going to add more in the future. Best to just call it out now instead of later when its too late. It may be too late already, TBO."
"Honestly I'd argue global passives are less predatory than existing gacha mechanics, because they let you boost your account without pulling for powercreep characters."
I'm not mad about the revive it's honestly a nice touch to tie into her divine authority as the chrysos heir of thanstos BUT!!!...Why. Tf. Is. It. Global???? Why
"I do agree that her global passive isn't really a big gameplay issue, but why did they give one to her in the first place since it doesn't even match her thematically to have it imo (i haven't finished the 3.1 story yet so i may be wrong)"
But why was it global????? That's what bugs me... what's the ooint of it working when she's not on the team???????
This is weird why do you hate Castorice global passive if Castorice wasn't in the party when bailou do the exact same thing revive one downed character automatically once per battle and that passive isn't working if bailou is not in the line up
If theres a global passives that increase base stats and talent lv increase then that will be the serious problem.
"i immediately right click on your video and click the ""Don't Recommend The Channel"""
"Not The End of The World, yet"
"Is this the end of HSR? No. My guess is that the next patch will make sales skyrocket.
Also, I don't think that people are exagerating.

HSR is a game that have DEV's killing their own game systems. The game have an elemental system that with the release of SW they tried to kill that system and since Acheron the system became dead.
Acheron started the saga of self suficient DPS units that could ignore the elemental/break bar system and after her a lot more units like that followed.
With Castorice's will be the same. The precedent is there and we, players of HSR or even Mihoyo's game, know really well the company, or at leasts should. The fact that there are leaks of a global passive new UI already says what they intend to do. 
Also, with Castorice they are going to kill the base of team building in HSR because now the teams are not 4 units anymore. The teams will be 4 units + all global passives avaliable. Also they are taking away from the player the choice of choosing what units to pull."
It is what it is.
"They deliberately chose to give Castorice the global passive because they they know she's a desirable unit. That way they can justify putting more global passives by saying ""Well, Castorice was profitable"", KNOWING but IGNORING the fact that she sold well because people love her, not the passive.

IMO, Star rail's gameplay was doomed from the start, it's too simplistic compared to other turn-based games. So they have to think of more new mechanics to set characters apart, breaking the rules too much and causing powercreep."
"I think it's a bad sign just as Acheron was that sets precedence for worse powercreep.
I don't blame people for quitting"
Global passives are unacceptable.
"This is a micro step to a disaster ( many new char will have global passive)
And ofc they will first not have a broken passive as they want us to get used to it"
disagree. it's not dumb at all
Let's all work hard giving bad reviews and telling Hoyo to remove the existence of Global Passives in the game.
"Let's say that you're completely right on this, why should anyone be ok with global passives? What do we gain from not being hostile towards the devs for adding this? If anything, overreacting helps us more than anything else."
"Not the end of the world because this is just them testing the water, in the future what can we get as guarantee that they won't add ""Cyrene auto delete 20% enemies hp when you start the battle, affect all endgame"" or ""March 9 action advance the whole team for 10% when you start the battle, affect all endgame"" ? Endgame will be balanced around the newest characters, Hoyo have made it clear on that in the past year, if this passive go through and players just went ""meh not the end of the world"" then the next year we can try to balance our account around 10 global passive that add up a bunch of QoL in endgame content, which is the primary source of income in this game, including SU/DU (which is only once a week and every 2 patches, yes, but even SU/DU is replacing events now), you will feel how miserable it is to clear those if you don't have the shilled characters, because you have to pull for 3 others for their global passive. 
 
Of course we can hope that this is just a one time thing, a Castorice unique and special effect, but even Acheron, their Mei, got all the special parts of her kit distributed around later characters. Nothing is unique in this game, you either go with their meta or you play for the story/collect characters for your dollhouse.  I don't think Castorice passive is the end of the world, it's the Pandora box that it will open. Frankly, every characters need their LC and maybe E1/ support now, if I have to pull for characters that previously I might get to skip just because of the passive later on then I'd rather quit and enjoy my time elsewhere. This is greed and they are showing you just how much greedier they can get, believe them before the sunk cost fallacy get to you."
"She doesn't need it, they just wanted to break another record."
im just glad this is finally here. I am so sick of this conversation no matter how it played out. until the day comes where hsr releases something COMPLETELY BONKERS. then and only then. but for now its tiring. its just a freakn revive. but hoyo isnt dumb. i highly doubt they will release a bonkers global passive.
"3:18 in noway this isn't a test, yes people are pulling Cas regardless but it also signifies that it's OK to add more global passives in the future, because unlike beta testers or people who read leaks, the ones that don't (which are most of the playerbase) don't really care about the game's balance, most of them don't even play endgame.

4:44 oh you clearly don't how Hoyo works, just like Genshin, their games are always at its best in the first 1-2 years, while slowly pushing the boundary along the way. And the moment they realize that players are hooked and won't stop playing no matter what, god forbid whatever scummy moves they'll throw at us to push the revenue.

I'd say the critisism is justified, it's not that they're worried of something that hasn't happended yet, that ""something"" has already happended, a mediocre global passive is still a global passive regardless. I played this game since 1.0 and already spent a bit, saw how seriously they were willing to take feedback and thought this time it'll be different, this'll be better than how they treat their Genshin players. Guess in the end it's still a Hoyo's game afterall, and I don't think ZZZ will be any different in a year."
"Maybe the reall issue is that no one wants to quit. Everyone is too far deep, so they want the game to get better. But when things like this happen they cant just leave and return, they take it out on community members

My two cents is to remember you wont „waste your money“ if you decide to stop, and as a f2p you havent „wasted your time“ gacha games are just games, leave and come back when you want too, or never, you arent going to die if you miss out"
Nah I'd quit
"Sure, this specific passive is not the end of the world but it's opening doors to worse things."
"future timeline: global passives giving damage boosts, etc, will massively increase powercreep -> eventual hp inflation, hoyo finally sees the issue and caps global passive to x amount selectable to be active, its a quick fix that still leaves players disgruntled but at least the game would still be playable for endgame"
End Game Content Like Simulated Universe Or Memories Chaos 😊😊😊Please Add In your Team
"It will trigger something even worse in the  future. I know not many people using Bailu unless they have no healer other than her, but with this global passive her existense is irrelevant. Might as well just delete her from the game at this point. And yes, more in the future. The powercreep already bad as it is, and yet they add one more checkboxes for it"
I appreciate that you are a rational and reasonable thinker.
"When it'll be too late all we will see is ""surprised Pikachu face""."
"Look. Adding a global passive, makes the concept and system behind them a feature in the game. 

If the charackter goes live like this, there will be more and you can definetly be sure its not just gonna be a bunch of revival passives. 

At first, a Revive, next More energy Regen, then a little bit of attack and soon enough all your charackters might be 20% stronger simply because you ""posess"" all the right units on your account.

This is not pandoras box, the box is opened as soon as it goes live. 

I"
""" guarantee that they won't add"" no you won't, never had and won't even if this would be removed, even won't from any other company either. This is the biggest reason why worrying about this is less than pointless. The reality is that it is ALWAYS a possibility and anything is possible if you play a game of ""if's"""
It’s the beginning of the end
who actually here is stupid enough to think they'd do that xd if they wanted to sell you a character they could do a lot more effective things than that
@ Like?
If I die even once during castorice update because of bosses being op for us to force to get castorice... Hoyo is getting sued
"@ If you know, you know is all i'll say. It's not good."
"As they said, the door has always been open, we just never entered it. They could've made tribbie e1 global, but they didnt, thankfully. They could make GP exist even from version 1.0, nothing was stopping them"
" @Liyern  if you play the game, you know those leaks are fake af (a speed global passive would brick your account for example, so there's no way they'd release a unit with one unless they want to lose a ton of money)"
" @27Ganon  Leaks say otherwise, thats why I said if you know, you know."
" @Liyern  as I said, those leaks are fake, which is obvious if you actually play the game

They'd never release a unit with a spd passive, that unit would brick your account if you pulled them - your intentionally slow units would be bricked and you'd have to redo the speed tuning for all your teams."
@27Ganon  Ok.
​@27Ganon This is hoyo that we are talking about. They are not to be trusted with this power because they are proven to not listen to their community and push  things to get more money. Look what happens to genshin with their own version of powercept. It is going to be worse because I don't believe hoyo would not take that step forward.
"@soullesssky33  why would Hoyo intentionally want to make players skip their unit and lose out on millions of dollars?

This would cause them to LOSE a ton of money due to people skipping an account bricking unit"
" @27Ganon  Because this is a gacha game. They going to start off slow and try to get people used to this before striking  to get as much money as possible. This is how the powercept will start, trust me. They are going to brick people accounts in the future   even if you don't see it right away."
" @soullesssky33  I don't think you get what I'm saying

I'm saying the leaks make no sense because one of the passives would brick your account, it's an incentive to NOT pull the unit and NOT spend money

Since again, a spd buff would brick your intentionally slow units and spd tuning

If you pulled the unit on accident, your account would be bricked, so you can't even build pity

If you otherwise wanted to pull the unit due to design/meta, etc., you can't anymore since again the spd passive would brick your account 

All I'm saying is that these leaks are obvious fake, because Hoyo wants to make money, not lose it

Hoyo is known to be greedy, why would they brick your account if you decided to spend money to pull?"
" @27Ganon  it doesn't matter what leak say or don't say. Hoyo  did powercept genshin so why wouldn't they do the same here. There will be a powercept so painful that many will stop playing. Look at how they treat their other games, they don't care at all about us so they will try this because they are that greedy and dumb to think it will work."
It shouldn’t be global. It’s totally stupid. Only when she’s on the team. Saying it’s a slippery slope is valid criticism. I don’t think this is getting overblown.
"OK, here me out, if they HAD to make a character with a Global Passive that buffs Damage and Crit, they should do a 4-Star and put them in a Permanent Event where everyone can get them for Free, that way, people won’t need to pull for a limited 5-Star they might not want just for a Global Passive they need, and with everyone having a Global Damage Buff, this could potentially allow people to use older Characters who’s Damage is lacking compared to newer Characters."
Hoyoshill
The buff to Blade is that he gets a global passive that allows everyone to deal a Bladillion damage
"Your devil's advocate line doesn't work with the fact that this is a global passive and it doesn't relate to how just getting this character does this to your account. This isn't something ""cool"" or ""thematic"" if so it'd be something easily added as a normal passive instead.  If this isn't them testing the waters I don't know what is; I feel that this is a bad test though given people will pull this character regardless."
"Its not about castorice global passive, alot of people already said its was not that op, the problem is its open a pandora box, that can and will slippery slop, did you really think hoyo who cant manage powercreep and hp inflation can manage global passive, oh look there a new char that will not sell well what we have to do?, lets add global passive so that people will be pressured to pull, it always start wit small thing like this."
"They def do be thinking that the death ability of Castorice will be ""Killing it"" especially the games' life expectancy."
"Hoyoshills gotta shill eh?
Can't wait to see excuses from John Hoyo's bootlickers like you when even worse passives are gonna be introduced"
"the issue about presedent isnt really that they ""can"" do it, obivously they can do anything, it's that it shows how they are now willing to do it. really the only way this could have possibly went down well is if they assured that global passives would only be small gimmicky things like this and saved for special occasions.

does seem like my choice to competlely skip hsr has been repeatedly vindicated over the years. though i do hope they don't remain the only hoyo game to buff old units and move old limiteds to standard."
"i largely agree with your points in the vid! definitely not a fan of the whole global passive concept unless it’s something benign like how in genshin some characters mark items on the minimap or reduce currency costs when leveling weapons… 

in the grand scheme though i dont think her revive will have a significant impact on combat-focused content so i hope nobody feels pressured/forced to pull her! 
but hopefully this is just a one-off since Castorice is the ✨big✨ anniversary character that’s been hyped up since her debut and so the devs just wanted to give her the extra special treatment"
"Okey so I think It depends, mainly whether endgame is going to be balanced around It or not. If It becomes hard to the point it's a necessity to have these passives then yeah, trash addition, but if it's balanced as usual then I think It could be okay because of reasons like giving a nudge to teams using older characters to keep up, as well as being a powercreep countermeasure. Imagine if in the future Castorice becomes super powercreeped, she would still have her usefulness because of this revive even if you dont use her. These are the kind of things that could happen if they dont balance endgame around these passives. The other extreme would be that if they release too many passives and still dont balance endgame around It, players could snowball through endgame, making It a breeze, depending on how game changing they are. All in all, It would be better if they didnt add them, but if they do, they should be few and far in between"
this precedent is unnacceptable to be set regardless of whether or not it's game-breaking on it's own or not because since this is now a thing that they are willing to do. there will be more
castorice's revive doesnt bother me because the people who feel like they NEED to pull her because of it probably should just get or upgrade their current sustain options.
"I think it's very easy to be dismissive of these until they end up stacking like a dozen different effects. ""It's just the revive"" ""It's just +5 speed"" ""It's just 10 CD"" ""It's just some attack"" until not whaling all of them means you're essentially playing with 5/6 relics."
"Castorice's global passive isn't dumb, it will only be dumb if most characters have it, making them very mandatory if you want to win endgame"
"If a free character that everyone gets FOR FREE has a global passive that majorly affects the battle, it's fine. If the character is locked behind a banner and has the same global passive, we have a problem"
"It won't be a bit issue because you'll almost never encounter it bar MHY making more one-shot bosses or you running sustainless, but the issue comes in the form of the future and what this opens up for MHY. 

But there's an easy fix: 

1) make it not work w/o Cast Iron Rice on the team
2) make it not work in MoC/PF/AS

It's that simple. You just made a bullshit passive w/ ambiguous implementation going forward into something perfectly fine and unique to a character, a la Acheron's overworld insta-kill. But this is HSR MHY we're talking about. They're not exactly known for being consumer friendly or not taking a mile when given an inch lmao"
im fine with the global passive but only because i hope they listen to us and take it out and give us compensation jades
good opinion
HoYoshills are OUT OF THEIR MIND!!!!!!! The COPE is INSANE! DUDE PLS SEEK HELP!!!!
Global nerf passive?
So 20k?
Can't wait for my FeiXiao to do 10k DMG on Ult!
The global passive makes that healing kills all destruction character
He just wants to justify pulling Castorice lol
"What??? 
OF COURSE it will be balanced around all the new units with more and more overpowered passives - HSR's whole endgame exists to FORCE player to pull new characters yet you still coping that these won't be important at all LMAO
No wonders game is in the worst possible state - toxic positivity and delusional fans destroyed it."
" @marcuskane1040  dude, Im not even pulling for Castorice, if end game gets too hard then I say fuck it and just play the story, which is what Im here for. I genuinely dont think anyone started playing honkai because they of their thirst for MoC or PF and if you can´t beat it then so be it, just be a casual, you will appreciate it in the long run and hoyoverse will have a smaller consistent playerbase and less people willing to spend because it wont matter in the long run if characters are going to be powercrept. It's on them, not on me, the delusional player who actually thinks of all the possibilities rather than assume the outcome"
"Maybe play Limbus Company, then?"
"The are already planning to make must pull globals.  I think Saber is going to have damage buffing capabilities based on the current leaks.  If it was simply them doing this to one character and that's it, the backlash wouldn't have been as thunderous.  However, we know they are planning 3 others and they are all stat buffs.  They are small rn, but they will absolutely increase them judging how different Anaxa is to Silver Wolf.  Its not that people see one thing and freaked out.  Its that they saw what they are doing now, what they are planning, and knew there was a pretty good chance that they would continue on the path they already started.  So it was a last ditch effort to stop them from starting down this path and signaling to other companies that they can do with their games as well considering Hoyoverse is considered the most successful gacha company currently."
Honkai star rail named Arlan’s skill “shackle breaker” and “swift harvest” so Im honestly not surprised they’re ignoring criticism
"Now that its confirmed, I'm now expecting to see characters w/ global passives that'll give your account bonus stats (Crit.Rate/DMG, ATK, DEF, HP, RES. PEN, ignore DEF, etc) on future updates

And I also have a feeling that they're going to inflate the enemies' HP even more in order to adjust to these permanent buffs"
"I think something should be said about ""blowing it out of proportion."" Not to disagree with that notion as it is easily the hottest topic out of the upcoming patch with many opinions, but there are a lot of reasons as to why it's exploded to this degree. A considerable part of the community (or at least a very vocal part of it), is unhappy with the game's current direction in various places, namely toward feelings of powercreep, lack of events or content, etc. The passive was the icing on the cake and I guarantee it wouldn't have garnered this level of disdain if the other aspects of the game were meeting player satisfaction expectations.

Concerning the video, I do agree with the notion that it's very much being exploded about. People are quitting and stuff over it, but the passive is better considered to be a death knell for the commitment of those players, assisted with a BUILDUP of the aforementioned unsatisfactory game factors.

The thing is, this passive never had to be globally applicable, neither did it need a persistent UI to let you know it's active. I would argue that yes, the passive was thematically and artistically inspired, but corporately tampered with. The negative press generated by this passive and its severity I would say is just to press an extreme reaction so that Hoyoverse would never go as far as to consider more drastic applications. To that end, if people are genuinely and severely outraging over it, then yeah it's not worth all of that; just leave the game behind. However, in my eyes there's nothing wrong with an extreme reaction towards a company that makes games with some of the most severe monetary strategies as a core mechanic. I mean, you can see it in the events itself; there's an entire whaling event. With that, I think it's much easier to assume that the passive was more corporately tampered with to this degree rather than the passive just being something cool.

Finally, while it's true they could've broken the game's balance instantly with an insane passive, that's just something they wouldn't do (for now). There's a reason why the ""foot-in-the-door"" argument is thrown around a lot concerning the passive. Many would rather have the door shut right now, with as much heated discourse as it takes, to prevent its potential future prominence in gameplay."
"You don't get it, the problem isn't Cast Iron Rice's revive itself (which is absolutely not a small thing at all since it procs for each party member), it's the fact that if she sells well which she definitely will because most Hoyo players are brain dead gambling addicts who only care about seeing numbers go up, then it means that we will get more global passives and you know for a fact that they will add some really broken ones."
"Nah. If this shit was in Genshin, you guys would be flipping out and saying it's the worst thing in the world. HSR players are hypocrites."
"Hoyoverse is what every company looks towards for a successful gacha game. If people let this slide, expect global passives in a bunch of other games in the coming years."
"I just hope that when they testing the water, they will give you a survey, so that I can still pull for her and against the global passive"
"The problem is that people defending this are showing a complete lack of ability to conceptualize second or third order effects, it doesn't end with Castorices passive, they'll be rewarded for this because she'll make money, because they can get away with it. They will do it again and worse."
Hmm I wanna if there will be vid after the dragon boss moc fight / 90% dmg reduction puts u at 1 hp bypasses shield  only way to pop bubble is to drain ur hp
Honestly this is exactly how I felt about Mydei’s auto battle lmao
5:12 minor misspelling mistake (Dragon ball Z text)
Hoyo greediness strikes again🙄🙄
"4:20 I think it is still a test just because its the FIRST of it’s kind. That’s why it looks like an overreaction to you, cause everyone is worried that if we don’t protest they‘ll use this to justify it being alright"
"I think the character that gets the most consitent out of her global passive is Fu Xuan. The only thing she can't tank is a Nikador without breaking his pillars, the global revive allows her to do that now, provided you save your ult because halving your HP consumes all charges."
"Instead of focusing on a nothing burger of a passive that barely does anything, because of some perceived hypothetical future character with a global passive that provides buffs/stats, how about we focus on real issues that actually exist in the game right now:

-Endgame modes are and have been a literal ad for the new banner unit every rotation for the past year.
-Lightcone banner is still not 100% rate-up even though most LCs are extremely niche and only work on their respective unit.
-MOZE was the last 4* they released. He came out 5 patches ago. Wtf?
-SU/DU expansions have been the same ""pick the right cards and beat the big boss"" formula since Swarm Disaster. I haven't felt like grinding that shit since GnG, which came out almost 2 years ago, and I'm sure most people agree. (I don't mean to shit on SU/DU enjoyers, keep doing your thing).
-There's still no relic loadouts. Wuwa got echo loadouts when 95% of characters in that game slap on one build and never have to take it off again. HSR has specific speed thresholds and tuning, and supports have to change builds as they change teams.
-Where the fuck are the skins? It's been 2 years hoyo. And no that m7 skin doesn't count.
-The housing system sucks. It gets 0 updates and the longer this goes on the more that 3 hour event feels like a waste of time.
-Each patch is 10% gameplay, 90% daily login to spend stamina and logout. Because of this, every patch since (imo) 1.6, which had GnG, felt like a filler patch with nothing to do except attempt infinite 0 cycles or whatever people do when they run out of content.
-The only good flagship event since release was the Jarilo-6 Pokemon event. Everything since has felt like mindless chores to complete for jades/resin/free LCs."
"I agree. I don't like Castorice's global buff, but honestly, I don't see it as much different from any other strategy Hoyo (and developers of gacha in general) use to ""nudge"" for pulling one character or another. End-game contents and buffs tailor-made for new units? New support that is better than the previous ones? New shiny DPS that outperforms the others? Hoyo is CONSTANTLY telling you what to pull. This is just another strategy. Players shall keep in mind that they will ALWAYS be able to skip units with global buffs for the very same reasons they can skip any other new character. It won't be the end of the world"
I love how literally EVERY 3.x DPS has had controversy
"1:09 also the revived character will die without taking any dmg from enemies if you dont heal/shield them before their next turn, castorice will basically kill them again om


her passive is rlly meh yeah, let's just see if the next ones(they'll definitely make more) will also be just quality of life and not straight up dmg increase(cope)"
"It's generally a good rule of thumb to expect this. It's also a good rule of thumb to remember a company doesn't care about its customers, only profit. But I guess most that play this game haven't been through enough school or are generally naive."
are you actually stupid enough to believe that xd
" @Wedo49  I agree that companies don’t care about their players. However, if a company actively screws over their players enough, they won’t have any customers anymore. That’s why I’m surprised, I feel like they’re creeping closer to losing their playerbase."
"1000% person. In the YT and Insta comments the Genshin could never resurfaced agains just cuz they treated them with one free 5 star that will be outclassed soon anyway. Also, sure, get more Seele cons but she'll still be subpar even at E6. Not to mention the lack of 4 stars."
"Dying in genshin is much easier, though, most teams don't use a healer"
"I havent seen anyone say „dont pull castorice“

If anything the kit leaks made more people want to get her. But they were still mad about this

I hope you have great pulls and castorice stays relevant for long enough"
What was The Herta’s controversy?
@ She’s the cieling breaking DPS that introduced more powercreep. Same as Acheron before her.
 @xman7566  ahhh k
" @xman7566  People have issues with every single character that release because ""this character does this!!!"" with Castorice's global passive being the only legitimate complaint.
The issue isn't that these characters do high damage, the issue is that Hoyo keeps buffing enemy HP so older and older characters feel weaker and weaker.
People will complain that ""Robin is better than Ruan Mei on FuA"" and ""Tribbie is better than Ruan Mei in AoE teams"" while ignoring that neither of them compare to Ruan Mei on Break teams because ""Break isn't meta anymore"" when it is still going strong lol

Not saying the complaints to Castorice aren't valid, just that there is controversy over every character for existing lol"
" @chadachi3970  True, heck while Castorice was the first global battle passive, she wasn't the first gameplay passive.  Put Acheron on the team and she kills small mobs in every area and you won't exactly run of TP snacks anytime soon.

Is the global passive a greedy precedent? Yes, but I also see the 4 old character buffs coming in a few months as non greedy, heck the last post launch Hoyo buff was Zhongli from Genshin and that was ages ago. Now they are doing four all at once.

The easiest message to send for those that want to send a message, is to just not roll and/or not use money during her banner.  It will be on repeat eventually and that lack of income during this period will speak.  I'm not going to uninstall the game at a few greedy misteps, but if people are okay with uninstalling, hey, that helps spread the message further."
"Yea it just kinda feels like they're getting significantly more greedy.
Aglaea and many other units seeing a pretty big performance drop without Sunday, their sig LCs having an unusually large gap between their best accessible option compared to previous ones, and now a global revive passive. Probably will only get worse from here."
"​ @chadachi3970 that's literally what I fear, these enemies gonna have hinger ho and also insane damage within only a few patches"
"​ @sweetillusions5495 honestly that's kinda a skill issue because sunday is great but not required. Sparkle exist, bronya exist. And about the energy, er orb exist"
" @Ilikeajaw  Tried comparing my Sparkle vs my Sunday for my Mydei and using her takes double the amount of cycles to clear while her gear was also significantly more difficult to farm for due to speed requirements. And then there's Jing Yuan who is just borderline unplayable without Sunday in modern content and Aglaea is decent at a baseline but a completely different unit with him in the team. That isn't normal.

The gap between LCs is also becoming a problem lately with how Mydei is very signature or bust, as having a near 40% damage difference between your best f2p option is an obscene gap and the worst one to date as most past signature LCs are like half that or less."
"@ tbf Sparkle is just a bad character, she is the closest 5* Harmony to being a 4* in terms of power because her main gimmick only really does anything for a single character. She doesn't even excel at anything, in most cases she is a worse Bronya because at e1+Sunday LC Bronya is SP Neutral while needing to roll for a LC and Bronya herself is free at e1 if you get her on starter banner.

E2 Bronya is just that much better, because its 100% AA + 29-31 Spd boost lol

Sparkle is just bad, she's made for mono quantum (which is... not viable lol) and DHIL, the latter Sunday with s1 is actually better for thanks to ult giving energy lol"
"Wow, a CC with an actual brain... 😁 Refreshing!😅"
"the problem is not how powerful castorice's global passive is. the problem is that it sets a precedent for more global buffs, which could eventually lead to ones that are incredibly powerful and downright mandatory for endgame."
So many gacha tourists don't even realise that many gachas have global account buffs. And this Castorice passive is nothing compared to those. Time to filter.
"re: no persistent threat of allies dying, I argue it opens up room for more enemy damage powercreep and one-shots akin to high-conundrum SU/DU since they can expect most people will have this free revive. Again, speculation, but it is a risk.

re: thematic/coolness > gameplay, Mydei’s autoplay doesn’t even make thematic/story sense. jfc I hate this argument with Mydei in particular. His story is about agency and learning that he can make his own choices, no matter what anyone says, so long as he’s willing to take the consequences of his own choices. Removing player agency takes away from this. Why are we able to play w/ other characters that have high agency or high political power but not him? THerta, Acheron, and Argenti answer to nobody. The Trailblaze is literally entirely about paving your own path like Mydei. Boothill is notoriously rebellious. Mydei’s autoplay makes no sense thematically. At least Feixiao’s arguably does, but it gives you a greater sense of control ON TOP OF being cool instead of taking it away. Even if it’s a false sense, it’s not equivalent to w/e tf they did to Mydei. I argue that anyone who insists the autoplay was for lore reasons doesn’t understand or didn’t pay attention to Mydei’s story

lastly they literally could’ve just made it a normal passive instead of a global one. It’s been established in story that her curse is proximity-based, so why should it work when she’s off the team?? This is our first revive passive on an e0 limited character, which is already quite special, even more so cause she’s a DPS.

It won’t be the end cause casuals won’t care, and some will pull for other reasons bc this particular passive “isn’t that bad” (tbf in a vacuum it is fine). I love Castorice’s character and the Amphoreus story enough to stay and pull a little, but Hoyo has lost a lot of my trust and probably a lot of others’ too. The fact that they apparently ignored such negative feedback for both Cas and Mydei and kept these mechanics indicates that they will not be so receptive to player/tester feedback in this department moving forward. They can always do whatever they want, you’re right about that, but if they want to keep good reviews and a strong playerbase, they need to maintain goodwill with the players and this isn’t how they do it. Keep it up and more WILL leave or make their dissatisfaction heard"
"I'll agree with what you've present, those are good points, but I still have some issues with what these global passives might represent. Something they could do (and probably won't) is give these passives to more than one character, if not all of them, including the ones that already exist. 
I saw global passives working on games where we get all character just by farming the game, and they give a small amount of base and special stats, good enough to have, but still not game changer."
"My take is that as long as they keep to 1 golbal passive active only, its not that big a deal. I'd much prefer them to do F2P alternatives like some kind of gadget and just reuse the UI elements from the scepters things in  SU.
But if you can Global Passive buff stack, I'm 100% leaving."
"I am really ready to quit this game, I can't stand the idea that Castorice is the test subject for Hoyo to add global passive to the game. Like we asked buffs for old characters we like to play, not this thing. The worst part is casual player who doesn't engage or not have enough knowledge about the implications of Castorice's future impact on the game is saddening for me. I am really tired of this game. I was originally going to quit after getting Phainon but... I don't know I just feel defeated for some reason, I like this game but I don't think devs respect me as player/customer."
"Hoyo has technically played with global passives before in genshin, but they were limited to just resources. 
If you owned certain characters, then forging certain weapons or enhancing certain weapons would cost less money, but they didn’t directly influence combat in any way. 
A passive that influences COMBAT when a character isn’t in the team feel weird though. If they make more passives like this, I feel that they should add a selector on which one is active, in order to prevent character stacking powercreep"
"here's the thing... like. this particular buff is nothing. but it's literally pandora's box. people have BEEN complaining abt it since beta and they refuse to do anything abt it. if they don't get enough backlash then they will continue to make more characters with a  global passive and they will very very likely stack. and not be as useless as castorice's. they set a precedent, people have been saying this for a reason goddamit.  this  video is incredibly shortsighted."
"I find it very intriguing how hoyo finds new ways to monetize a new Waifu, what will be the next ? "" While x character is on the field, all enemies cant target it only  by target by aoe? """
I think this is just an anniversary character thing tbh. Just cool utility stuff not affecting the dmg of your characters. Acheron had one shot ability and Castorice has a revive.
"The way I see it, it's about parity and equity. Global passive breaks a fundamental rule of the game: only active characters can affect battle.

The more they break their own rules, the more disenfranchised players will get.
Baked in weakness implants like Firefly and Boothill was already a major rule breaking moment. We didn't need another one already on just the 2nd anniversary."
We already have leaks of the other passives of upcoming characters... And they are actually VERY useful
"Shouldn't having her make our run easier? Why people hate a QoL?
In Genshin there's global passive such as double crafting (Sucrose Ayaka), double cooking (Diona Jean), reduce gold spent (Raiden Wanderer), easier local special farming (Klee Tignari), and etc etc."
"Of course you short-sighted people might not see this as a major issue. A global passive system is fine if it's obtainable solely through in-game currency, not by swiping your card.
People may not recognize the problem immediately because it's a long-term concern. Knowing how HoYo operates, they definitely won't stop here with Castorice.
It's your choice whether to continue supporting the game or not. But choose wisely, you might end up wasting your time and money on a game that could be dead in the near future."
"They make a new baseline to promote character in the way of totally powercreep other character in the past. This new baseline is beyond comprehend and I think for turn based game, its ridiculous."
2:40 bro this has got to be some of the most brain dead cope take I’ve heard….no the only reason they are doing it is to take away the power of deciding what characters to pull from the players to hoyos hands. They don’t care about the character only what can they do increase revenue from the player.
"Just letting everyone know that if you quit Genshin Starrail or zzz for 15 days, and then come back, you will get a return event.
Yes, I know it, but the daily grinding is exhausted😅"
"game quality went down a long time ago and people are still hoping??????????????????????????
 3.0  story was badly presented and Hp inflation has been happening a long time ago and don't forget at the rate the old units are being power creeped. what more do you need to see that the game is going down hill?"
"another thing is that CN servers get 2.4 million visual artbooks for free, while global servers doesn’t get any thing"
Soooo just pull the freaking character… It ain’t that deep bro… Plus endgame is not something you HAVE to do… it’s not mandatory…
"I have read this comment about a 100 times now, and it's getting frustrating because nothing like that is gonna happen"
​ @kaelr82  Are you sure about that ?
 @kaelr82  Nobody can predict the future. So it is true that we can not for sure say that something bad WILL happen. But by the same token you can not say that it WON'T happen. And unfortunately the very nature of gacha games (almost always) means that players will (should?) assume that the publisher is not on their side and expect the worse possible outcome.
 @kaelr82  Then read it a thousand times then remember to go back to that comment when it inevitably happens lol.
Like? closest thing is divine key in Honkai impact which is among several gacha I played and everyone agrees it's a p2w system
Examples for mainstream Gacha games like that?
Idk man FGO and GBF never had global buffs despite being grindier and having harder content
"That sounds like a really decent idea, but we are talking about Hoyo here so definitely not happening. Stacking global passives is the only way that you can beat the new release 50 million hp boss"
Acheron's techninque has more value than this shit xd
"Yeah I also think like that, imagine having 5+ or 10+ active passive at the same time ☠️"
The worst the passives got was like nahida blocking off the thought dialogue if you didn’t have her
don't look chinese reaction to the passive you will smile
"The point is that the ""precedent"" was and is NEVER needed to begin with... Legit at any point they could make something give a 50% dmg increase but only if you pull this thing. Anything is possible if you start playing the game of ""IF's"" after all."
"dawg i think you just described yan qing, the undisputed title holder for the worst 5 star in the game."
"I think the way they designed break, it pretty much HAD to be done for the break damage dealers to work. These also don't reduce the enemies' resistance to the element. But even then, you could argue that's just bad game design and I'd be inclined to agree.

The ones I do find problematic are Silver Wolf, Acheron and Feixiao. Silver Wolf isn't a big problem now because of her kit's inherent issues, but Acheron has no business dealing colourless toughness damage while also having res pen, and the same can be said about Feixiao's toughness damage.

And also, what the hell is the point of Anaxa being able to implant every single weakness to all enemies at once? They don't even lose the resistances, and it's not a gimmic to enable an archetype. I'm completely baffled."
"​@crashsparrow6943 yup, pretty much agree. Acheron reducing toughness through toughness protection status is probably the worst offender.

I disagree that it was necessary for break though. Without fire implant, Firefly would've been great DPS for only fire enemies. Which was part of the original balancing reason for elements to begin with. But they wanted to make her *universally * good.

And I say this criticism as someone with an E6 Firefly, lol."
​ @xanaviii  I disagree if firefly is only good for fire enemies that will limit her too much you might as well just pull a crit unit or any damage type
"​ @xanaviii I don't think that Firefly would be ok without colourless toughness break. Problem with break carries is that they don't do any dmg if the enemy isn't broken. Crit carry will deal less dmg, but not by that much (unless you are trying to kill an enemy with 60% res against your carry's element)."
" @blueknight2983  I think this limitation would be better for the game, but hoyo just enabled this perspective after and because of acheron. The lack of respect to their own type system is what makes firefly more appealing by having fire implant, while also making balance worse. Hoyo is saying ""instead of pulling for a specific damage types just pull those characters who can do anything"" which makes elemental system obsolete. And i'm not even talking about damage powercreep, it's a powercreep of systems."
Rules are made to be broken!
Weakness implant is ok
"I guarantee that if Firefly or Boothill couldn't do weakness implant people would have been screaming about how Hoyo was being vewwy vewwy mean and punishing players who didn't pull Silver Wolf. I mean, they did the same screaming when Aglaea dropped and it turned out that really letting her off the chain more or less required Sunday.

I'm not here to defend global passives, but comparing it to the Super Break team design is a bit spurious."
"""They break their own rules""??? Really? 
First of all point me pls - where it was written this ""rule""?
2nd try Honkai Impact 3rd that has global passives for a long time. They change almost NOTHING."
"It's only been two years, I can't imagine how they will break the rules even more on the next anniversary"
The game is 100% going to be dead in the future though every game ends.  Most people aren't here trying to play future rail though they just want to enjoy the game now and most likely won't even be playing by the time it ends anyway.
A hoyo game ever reaching eos is highly unlikely seeing how fgo has existed for a decade now😭
"​ @solardxgamer1692   What I love about FGO is the fact that all rarity are being loved by the community and have their own dedicated fans. Be it one star, two star and so on. Plus, newer units doesn't always end up better which are good thing to me since I'm F2P in that game. But seeing HSR, it's pain since they keep pumping out 5 stars while our last 4 star is Moze which came out a year ago..."
"Not to be rude, but I dont think you realise the full effect this could have. If this is successful, which it most likely will be, they will definitely keep pushing it towards global dmg, crit, spd buffs etc, and then other gacha games will see it's success and copy it.

Me personally, I'm sticking until the Fate Collab and if the global passives are starting to/have become a real problem I will drop HSR."
"Yeah, I don't have the energy to get as angry as everyone else. There are other things to do in life that saps my energy and other games that entertain me."
"I'd be happy to lose this 50/50 because I don't really care for the meta and would rather tackle endgame without relying on the so-called ""power-creeping"" or this new global passive."
"""It's just horse armor""
""it's just skins""
""it's just loot boxes""
""it's just battlepasses""
""it's just $600 for C1 Furina"""
"It would actually suck balls if sticking a global passive on a hero is hoyo's idea of making them more meta viable/stronger. 
I dont think it even should be in a tryhard grindy game like this at all, no matter how strong or weak it is. 
Like they got the idea that they can do this and that in itself is scary because there is no telling what future characters will do. I think that fear of what can be done is one of the main forces. Nothing could happen, but the thought of something happening is not a pleasant one"
"I am personally not too bothered by this situation and you sum up my feelings quite well.

I play a game because i enjoy it, and if enough internal or external factors change that perspective i move on.

The relative power of characters or the difficulty of the end game content have never been issues for me, even before i could 3* MoC it was only 60 jade i lost out on.

I get the feeling some people just care way too much about their relative performance in the game, you aren't really competing against anyone.

That said, if this is what debacle is what makes you quit, I don't blame you and fully support that decision."
"So funnily i think the controversy is a symptom of something else

Frustration at the General Direction HSR is Heading

Yknow at least with Genshin theres the Aurgument that its a game that caters to a Casual Audience 

But even it is experiencing a similar debate as even the Casual Elements are falling into Typical Gacha trappings 

Hoyo Games are just becoming more Gacha. Aspects that they usual bunk are becoming more present

Yknow the benifits there adding for Whales is just the Black Card or Exclusives from other Gacha 

Buffs aren't new to Gacha but even the most significant buffs dont matter when Powercreep out paces it 

I think the anger is that people have found themselves liking Gacha.

Games have an upfront fee in terms of time and money. Where Gacha are burst of times spread out with the option to pay

Full games ask 40 to 100 hour upfront and 70 to 100 dollar's 

If your somebody who enjoyed HSR whats the alternative and i mean in terms of polish 

So people are frustrated"
"if you have bad account, single revive wont help
if you have mid account, its easy to sustain
if you have good account, you still 0cycle without her"
"Always appreciate the curious, neutral outlook you have as opposed to the highly negative views or toxic positivity we find too often (also adorable Castorice thumbnail)"
"(Not in response to the video, but the situation)

The issue I see is the fact that HoYo sets the precedent.

Meaning every game will eventually do this. 

Making the gacha genre even more predatory, which only hurts the players."
"Wish that passive didn’t become global. There was so much hate, yet hoyo did nothing"
"This problem is being taken so out of proportion. People is talking like this pasive is goint to one shoot the bose that was killing your whole team already, not just one character, or like they weren't going to pull ever again for a new character, you can wait of one that you like. The powercreep in the game is out of control but the problem is not here but in the ridiculous hp inflation. We don't know if we are ever going to get another universal pasive (Anaxa doesn't have one) but we know that hp keeps going up and that old units are getting buffed. I don't know how things are going to end, but there are far more relevant things to talk about that this."
"I absolutly do not care about any global passives or powercreep in HSR because in my eyes it is a game about lore and story with some gameplay attached to it for appearances. I will play it as long as the story is good. in games like genshin or ZZZ such things would be inexcusable, but it is a game you leave on auto for most of the playtime, why would i care"
"Ok here is my Hoyo shill take. Healing is just worse than shielding and with HP scaling characters they can no longer use Max HP boosts in healers kits to make them more similar to shields. They know everyone will get Castorice because she is a popular character that they have been pushing. They give her a global passive allowing you to revive IF you have a way to heal in order to counterbalance shielding being stronger. Now how much you heal matters more because you’re healing all the way from 0. 

But they could’ve done this differently still and I’d rather they didn’t do this"
these comments just do not understand that this very likely could be a one time unique thing.if hoyo really wanted global passives on just any character they wouldve done it in genshin atp but it wouldnt make sense lore wise so they havent. im like 95% sure this is one time thing that we wont see again unless its on another anniversry character which again theyd have make it fit the lore of the character and not just slap it on even if it doesnt work with the story.
"To be honest, I don't think the whole playerbase would be outraged by this. The real majority of the playerbase, the real casuals who do not engage with the online community of HSR or any gacha in general will not care about this. We're in the smallest minority so I doubt the outrage for the global passive will amount to anything in the grand scheme of things. But we'll see."
should've been a normal passive for her current team only smh...
wkwkkwkwkw
hmm
"I was at a con recently many HSR cosplayer to love for the game despite Castorice.
To even Clara's VA being there"
It's funny how they're even doing a top-up event to make more bucks to push this global passive even more in HSR
⁠​⁠ @izzme5204 all hoyo games have always gotten 1st time top up resets for their anniversaries to incentivize spending so i doubt they’re resetting the top up in HSR specifically to push the global passive concept
"I am rather certain hoyo wouldn't push global stat buffs as a mechanic in future kits. The simple reason being HSR devs aren't stupid enough to kill the balance of a game over a very very marginal amount of extra money in the short term.

You might think ""Well HSR Devs don't care about balance at all"". 

To which I would say, if they really didn't care about fundamental game balance, why would they ever restrict Sunday's skill to only non-harmony units? If they really didn't care about game balance, they would've forgone all restrictions and let the game run wild with infinite energy exploits and infinite turn loops.

If the Devs really want to push global passives, how come neither Anaxa, Hyacine, nor Cipher have been leaked with any in their kit? That would surely make more money right?

The cold hard truth is, the reason why Reddit and Twitter have been parroting this global stat buff paranoia is because none of them are businessmen, actuaries, or game developers who know how to maximise profit. They think global stat buffs will make hoyo more money but if anything, they will lose money in the long run. 

""How would they lose money? Global passives incentivise and create FOMO!""

It's exactly because it creates FOMO that they will lose money. Imagine five units come out with no global passives and then one comes out after with a passive. Would anyone really spend money on any of those five units if they know that another higher value unit with a global passive would be coming? Probably not. If people collectively feel this FOMO and stop pulling for a few patches, most f2p would have enough pulls to E2S1 the new unit anyway so hoyo wouldn't even be able to suck the low spenders dry."
"I think it only happen for special character like Phainon, IPC high member, Emanator.."
"@ You get stuff for spending money, wow big shocker. Obviously they want you to spend a lot, but to get the good stuff it's like a single $100 + $50 pack and it lasts until 3.4? Obviously not everyone can afford that, but if they can't then why are they bothered by it? It's a gacha game, you spend you get more, that's how the game works. Is it predatory? Of course it is, but it's up to you to choose whether you're able to spend and if you spend while not being able to afford due to ""fomo"" that doesn't exist, you're just dumb lol"
they won't xd
"And in all these cases you can make an argument on why they can be good addition to the game


Except horse armor and 600 dollar furina, that is just a scam and lack of self controll"
​ @ibrahim5463 horse armour is just skins for your horse's
"Pfft only c1?
Nah add a couple more hundreds you atleast need c2 lol"
Ok there's literally no way you dont get C1 Furina before getting anywhere near 600 dollars unless you are blowing it on Standard banner for star glitter for the limited banner. Also ironically enough Genshin is the only game where not spending money is ALLOWED. People really don't know how spoiled they are because Genshin is babies first gacha where they don't realize how unprecedented it is for LAUNCH UNITS to still be used and actually be meta. C0S0 Furina is more than fine when every other game copying the Genshin gacha almost always requires a copy and signature weapon to function on any meaningful level.
"I remember the days where players used to say characters felt complete at e0s0 or that eidolons weren't that important since they're weak. Global passives will for sure not follow the same trend, right?"
"The problem is, you don't NEED any of these. Stop being an idiot."
Hoyoshill coping mechanism in a nutshell
The issue with this is you don't NEED any of these.
"It's just a ""faker"" skin"
​ @Stormvanguard-bz8ow  it's a reference to a real life case...
"If you understand what $600 means, then you're just like me: chronically online."
What does the horse armour reference?
​ @kaizenx5  Elder Scrolls stuff. Horse armor is apparently one of the first ever known instances of microtransaction.

" @mesacomplains3404  fair, i typed first, then i watched"
"And a worse thing that comes out of it, is that HoYo didn't listen, meaning that they also probably won't in the future."
"(Leaks) + response to video 




They already are planning more that DO change stats of characters. 

This is and will be the precedent probably, and will be a very dark space.

Especially when so many of the wanted characters will have these passives, meaning it's known well that people won't vote with their wallets as a community.

Showing that change won't come. 

We can already see what will and is happening."
 @therealestsparkle  As far as I've seen there has not been any more passives stated to come in the future. I'm not sure where you're getting this info
 @tyran8165  Phanion is apparently supposed to have crit related passive
 @therealestsparkle  You don't have proof of this
" @solomoncounts6676  My link got deleted.

Just search ""HSR Phanion Global Passive Leak"" if you wanna see it."
"Not to be disrespectful but this is why hoyo games will never listen to criticism or just improve in a meaningful way, because the majority just don't care."
"@amirmahdi9373  yes and no. I don't deny that it is about players voting with their wallets, but on the other hand, we have ZZZ. Zzz devs try to listen to what players want and have made a lot of significant changes (like removing TVs). So its not like they don't want to listen because people will pay anyway and more like trying out the waters on what is the most effective strategies for their future projects are (can they get away with powercreep, how stingy/generous can they get with the currency, etc). So while even in this case player opinion probably metters for thier future peojects, i don't think it will have a big impact on HSR. Obviously, its just a lot of speculatuion without proves, but at least it is how i see the stuation"
"Now consider this:
Have you ever played Honkai Star Rail in your life
In what world did you get the fact Shields > Healing 💀💀💀 They both have their downsides"
@kin4244shields are much better than healing because you can survive 1 shots more reliably.
"Phainon is currently in testing also has a global passive for Crit stats ^^ 

And another thing the teams for all games are like... very different in both managerial position as well as like actual devs"
There are already leaks saying Phainon will have a global passive.
 @MegaMeister123  how do you know? stop looking at leaks lmao its all fake
 @sora6969 bwe knew the global passives was coming because of leaks?
@ those are closed beta footage. not leaks. leaks are the ones that some random unc said on telegram
"The thing is apparently CN players repeatedly voices their concerns about this since the first beta but they ignored them. So yeah, as I said in another comment, casuals are the reasons why hoyo games will never live up to their potential and allow them to do whatever they want because: ""I don't care I play for the story"" or ""I don't do endgame."""
 @amirmahdi9373 cuz they arent free all day to grind the game and has an actual life?
 @amirmahdi9373  Were those players actually beta testers or just following leaks? cause if it was leaks then no shit they ignored them as would any company even the ones you would think least likely to.
 @minecraftliker3  no no I'm pretty sure they were beta testers because I heard people share their experiences. And I mean when beta starts the kit info gets out so yeah.
" @amirmahdi9373  so they weren't cause actual beta testers are under NDA...
and no the kit info is not public when the beta starts either..."
 @minecraftliker3 oh I didn't know that because I follow leaks I forgot how that works.
"Hoyo shill. Not the end sure, but its a start for something bad, not only for HSR, but for the gatcha games in general. Hoyo just set a precedent and other companies are gonna react accordingly."
"honestly you sum up my feelings on the matter really well, it sucks but at this point in time we can't really do anything, just be tentative with the whole idea of global passives and hope this doesn't turn out as bad as many expected and won't actually affect the enjoyment from the game for many people

I'm still really excited for the next patch cause of all the changes coming in and I am 100% pulling for Anaxa. I'm hesitant on Castorice cause I love dragon and she has a cool dragon but that's kinda all I like about her other than her animations? so idk if it'd be worth pulling just for those two things when her kit and gameplay themselves don't really call to me"
It sets a dangerous precedent
"It can bloom into something worse. But I think the same thought process can be applied to just ""nothing could happen"". Its not enough for me to quit, personally, and I personally think generic stat ups will be practically useless. With how bloated (unfortunately) harmonies are, I don't think extra crit or atk or dmg% will really matter much in the long run."
i hope it's toggleable
"You're not supposed to make sense in this community man, only complain about the devs every turn. How will the drama agenda get farmed otherwise? smh my head"
"Rthis wont work on sustainless teams btw, bc the characcer needs to be healed or shielded"
"If they want it to be lore accurate mechanic they could just make it inside Amphoreus and in non-endgame
But they have to do this bitter taste to our mouth
The next passive is where I decide for keeping in the game or not"
"Honestly, it's likely that it's really not gonna work on end-game driven content. It's prob gonna be a SU/Normal Mode novelty, while staying completely out of any higher difficulty content by just disabling it there."
"TL;DR ; Global passives are longterm effects that will enhance powercreep even more

shorter text for those that dont want to read more ;  
THIS is testing the waters, this is either them ignoring feedback for a mundane detail or deliberately trying out global passives -- Global passives are a LONG TERM ISSUE and will affect EVERYONE who doesnt have every character --  The timeline of beta testing cas and anaxa to them adding global passive to one and buffing them while nerfing the more hyped one is another issue in itself -- ""vote with wallet"" is not effective because the community is literally playing a game about gambling for digital characters that will be worthless sooner or later -- powercreep still getting ignored for the majority while releasing global passives that WILL influence the decisions for endgame content SUCK



Most people who are criticizing it arent doing it BECAUSE of the revive

Its the criticism of Hoyo painstakingly testing the waters on global passive approval, the issues at hand with powercreep not getting adressed in any way for most older units BUT instead introducing another thing that will be taken into consideration for new endgame fights. 

AND the worst part of it all is what WILL come next if the community isnt loud and clear about this. 

We dont NEED nor want global passives in general, but even moreso the ones that have stat manipulations like adding literal Crit Dmg like what apparently Phainon gets tested on right now or similiar mechanics.

THAT is the isuse because this game already doesnt struggle with making characters indocue FOMO upon us all, this will make that FOMO 90% worse. 



Some people are also not happy about the blatant favoritism for Cas in the upcoming patch. 
Character test leaks come out < People are more hyped for Anaxa < buff cas < people still want anaxa < nerf Anaxa < people still want Anaxa < Test global passives and nerf Anaxa even more into the ground while buffing cas

THAT entire timeline feels very scummy and that paired with the feeling of them ignoring powercreep  while making a new mechanic which will guaranteed speed up the process is making people rightfully upset.

Personally I will stop playing this game alltogehter once the characters actually release and Cas having a global passive. I dont want to support this predatory marketing either monetary wise, which I did do in the past I am a shark level spender consistently, or even number wise on their playercounts. 

I find the discussions especially in the hoyolab very... distgusting in how people try to defend the practices done. Them taking microsteps each patch pushing more FOMO onto each character and each time people say ""but this isnt actually that bad"" while ignoring every criticism point.




Points I disagree on
 
2:00 
Yes they can buff the shit out of damage on enemies. That will make a difference and that WILL happen either be it when the next shielding sustain comes into play or the near fututure. 


3:20
Thats literally testing the waters. They will see how many people are already fine with having global passives. That is LITERALLY testing the waters in every way possible

4:20 And that is an issue no doubt. People are not good at actual boycotts especially when it comes to the gaming scene. I mean hell have you considered that gacha is literally gambling with no monetary return and instead characters that will become worse and worse every patch?

5:00 That is the issue with global passives. This will never happen. You will always be on the brink between ""this is kinda a must pull because of the passive"" vs ""ah its just a small thing it doesnt matter"" thats why the entire global passive thing is such an issue. The players dont realize how much it will stack overtime and especially in 2-3 years if they were to continue that way of releasing characters with the ""new"" mechanic more than twice a year.

Global passives arent immediate issues, they are becoming ones that will wreck the place very hard

And yes the devs could just ruin the game at any moment and honestly the fact they got so much feedback AGAINST global passives is in no way enough but it for sure is an indicator that they are willing to either put the smallest detail above critcism of not just any part of the community but the literal beta playtesters  
OR 
they are willing to introduce the mechanic despite the negative feedback."
Castorice opened a new era with her existence bringing innovation to the game.
I wish it was passive not global passive
"I dont like how the passive works when Castorice isnt on the team. It doesnt make sense. Funny enough, the lore would show that Castorice needs to be nearby you for her power to be effective against you. Since she is not on the team and the passive still works, this also doesnt make lore sense lol"
"ngl, but the passive makes me wanna pull her even more, but I 1000% see the issue with having it work without her in the team"
I really hope it's just a one time way to fit with castorice's lore and not the next big idea their trying to push
Hello.
"Without getting into any of the discussion about if it's good or bad, this is absolutely not the first gacha game to have global passives. It isn't even the first Hoyo game to have global passives."
"Thats exactly what so many dont get. Ya, this global passive is whatever, but its not the ability that is bad, its the idea in one of the biggest gachas doing it and many defending it."
​ @jadetarem Its the first time a mainstream very popular gacha game from hoyo does that which will influence others in the scene as well
 @MegaMeister123  Genshin already had global passives to though those talent material refunds you get for having a character on your account were already big buffs that can save you hundred of resin every month at the very least this don't even include stuff like discounts on prices of weapon ascension for pulling Raiden.
" @jadetarem  
Yes, this isn't the first time a gacha game introduces a global passives mechanic. The difference being that other gacha games make the global passives part of the base system, so both F2Ps AND P2Ws have equal standing grounds. They don't lock the global passive behind a gacha character.

HI3rd does have global passives as well in the form of Divine Keys, which is still terrible, but the main difference is that most of them have craftable alternatives released some time after the Divine Key's release. HSR, as we know so far, is only releasing these global passives on limited characters, the most egregious one being the Fate collab characters, because they're only gonna be run once and probably will never be re-run ever again, just like the EVA collab in HI3rd."
except when they release 2 characters that are Crit buffing and thus giving you either 2 highroll crit rolls each so you can build your characters easier OR enhance them more
"​ @MegaMeister123  Stat buff global passives are like pissing in an ocean. Most accounts will get better relic quality over time, especially with the custom resins. The passive buff would need to be a complete new modifier since all the traditional stats like DMG%, Crit Stats, and ATK are oversaturated with our current Harmony units. If we start getting passive Vulnerability, Defense Ignore/Shred, Res Pen--that's when the worry should set in."
" @megidolaon384  We are fearing about Vul, Def ignore/shred, res pen like global passive in the future, We can't guarantee that they won't do these, and We do have concern that they will do it because Hoyoverse is a gacha game company and When something becomes a Precedent, they never let it go and keep milking it over and over again."
"BLOOM??
When two elements love eachother very much.."
"it sure as hell is enough to make me quit, fuck this game"
yea cuz guide makers  who get castorice are gonna be slightly skewed. even moreso if future global passives have more proper buffs
"@seaberrysvideodump9602  i genuinely think only anniversary units will have weak global passives if anyone gets it after castorice 
since her passive is technically useless without a healer/shielder and even with one if you don't have an ult that heals/shields you are screwed since after that unit's extra turn after revive they are downed again, your sustain wouldn't immediately have a turn if they weren't drowned as well which most likely wouldn't happen since sustains are the tankiest of any team
also wouldn't want cas revive to trigger first (before revive) in Du cuz it actually can revive the whole team if they were all knocked out simultaneously while the blessing only revives one character so it must trigger first"
@  let's hope so...
You’re not supposed to complain when the devs make a new way to be even more predatory that allows them to balance the game where you need a character you don’t even want just for their global passive. You shouldn’t complain when the devs release a character with a passive stronger than Castorice’s. Smh my head
" @s2wuolf508  Try to comment on it when you understand the subject please. You're afraid of the unknown and flailing, just make it known instead so you don't have anything to worry about. The video talks about this, wait and see."
" @ch1dd   Applying that kind of “brave the unknown” logic when you know that 1.) the company is infamously greedy, 2.) they have a powercreep issue and 3.) its a gacha game is so ignorant of the situation.

Going again to the metaphor you gave, you’re not going to see a hole that’s completely dark and jump into it when you know its going to harm you. BUT you can try to cover the hole and put a sign on it to prevent yourself and others from falling into it. Criticising the devs to try to stop them from going overboard is that sign/barrier"
"@ It's not ""brave the unknown"", it's ""learn what you're talking about"". You're fighting ghosts! a passive that you don't know if it will ever return, or how it will be implemented if it does, or what it will do. Stop schizoposting and learn what's in the dark hole. You're looking at a puddle, for the record."
"Uh... hate to break it to ya, but it works EVERYWHERE."
"It's gonna work, but it's still irrelevant to 99.9% of the community. If someone is dying in 2025 they have worse problems or it's a one-off thing like the video mentions, and sustainless teams only get to survive a little longer because you still have to heal or shield to come back from death's door. Completely overblown non-issue, and anything that has to do with what it will bring in the future is straight up baseless doomposting this early in time."
 @ch1dd gacha really rotted your brain when you consider it baseless that its from an already infamously greedy gacha company
"@ I think it rotted yours because you have extreme paranoia over it. I am fortunate enough to know how this works, so it doesn't bother me in the slightest. I'm skipping castorice as I have no use for her, and it's not a global passive that will make me pull any unit ever because I'm not at FOMO's mercy, I'm actually of sound mind."
 @ch1dd  “paranoia” when its a notoriously greedy gacha company with power creep issues. At the very least as long as people are angry over it they don’t go overboard with global passives in the future
"@ All the people that are angry in the entire world don't amount to anything, you're so out of depth it's insane. They could all quit at once and nothing would change because it doesn't matter, it's an impossibly small portion of the playerbase. Then, when nothing happens and you're proven wrong things change to ""phew, that was close guys, good thing we got together and said something online or it would have been real bad, we saved it"". Totally haven't seen this a billion times over the years, totally not baseless doomposting."
" @ch1dd    To clarify the doompost isn’t that the game isn’t going to survive, its genuine concern that the experience is just going to get worse, I wouldn’t call the concern that the game experience can get worse baseless when it is an infamously greedy gacha company.

I also am going to skip Castorice since I built my acct p well already and don’t need her passive.

What do you mean by nothing happens as well? That they don’t release even stronger powercreeping global passives or that they genuinely don’t listen to playerbase anyway.

I genuinely want to know your thought process about this."
​ @ch1dd I think you're intentionally trying not to understand the point they're making at this point.
"@ Concerns are not what you're doing, it's plain doomposting, you're not concerned about the future but afraid it will go bad and arguing in that direction by default. I don't know how you don't realize it reading things yourself.

They listen to the playerbase, but they don't have to do everything they're told, that's not how feedback works. It's the portion of the playerbase that cares about this being minuscule, the amount of people who even open the endgame screen is minimal. From those, the people who know this is a non-issue and the ones who pay too much to care outweight the ones complaining, even if they were all gone nothing would change. And I hope they keep their word and leave because worrying over nothing every patch will only make them unhappy, on top of getting farmed by creators stoking drama.

It's the same thing every time something new gets released since 1.0, a scandal about superbreak, a scandal about full team advance, a scandal about Mydei's auto, no one learns. It's exhauusting."
" @ch1dd  The only part I agree with you is the middle paragraph tbf. Though personally I was not part of the superbreak scandal or mydei scandal since I genuinely think those are non issues hell I didn’t even realise there was a scandal. I ignore pretty much most drama in this community because I genuinely don’t care about it. Though this is one issue that I find to be worth caring about.

We’re afraid because of our concern that the game is going to accelerate to a more predatory experience. Global passives means that even if you don’t like a character you might want to pull for the buff itself. It may not be an issue when it is minor buffs and at the start, but becomes an issue when they keep releasing more and more characters with global passives and it stacks.

But yeah, the options are to keep playing and hope they don’t go overboard or just leave first."
"@ At least we have some common ground to drive the point home. All the things I mentioned were overblown just like this but not in the same scale, and none of them matter, it's all drama. This one you're not concerned about the buff, just the feature, but every single character has a risk of you disliking them but wanting something from their kit. How many people skipped jiaoqiu despite having acheron? skipped tribbie because she's a kid model? people even skip characters for being men. Global passives are no different.

Anaxa is coming out and his kit doesn't have a global passive in it, from what I've seen from others they don't either, it's specific characters only. In fact it would be beneficial for the people who can't clear the game currently to get some help from outside their team, because there's nowhere else they can get help from when they enter a stage. But people would rather freak out about it by default simply because they don't know how to respond to new information. It's no secret that people are resistant to change, but with minimum scrutiny it's easy to tell what is worth worrying about and what isn't."
" @ch1dd    While I agree most people easily freak out over anything and are resistant to change. That happens both against improvement and degeneration. If people are resistant and it turns out its a change that would be bad, its a moment where it makes sense to support while also reminding people to be more analytical first before reacting. If they are resistant to something that would be beneficial is when you can call it out in force. I used to have the same mindset as you so I understand where you’re coming from with it.

Your character kit examples are literally the character’s kit where it requires you to have that character in the team, not a passive that is global so its quite redundant in the situation. 

Regarding worth worrying, people don’t want the experience to get worse which is an understandable worry. Though, the extent a smaller handful of people go overboard dunking in people who just pull castorice is annoying. 

If its a game they actually like and with a company they know does not gaf abt them. Though it feels horrible it is sensible to just accept the situation and choose options such as leaving the game and see if the game experiencd becomes far worse, play but not spend any more money in case the game experiencebecomes far worse and you lessen sunk cost, or just don’t gaf abt the game’s health anymore and have fun while it lasts"
"@ youtube is doing the thing where messages don't show up on the notification tab, I sent it twice and cba to go sort everything by new to see if it posted properly. Hope they showed up there."
"i still believe that if a global passive comes out as broken the CN community will have a word and since hoyo only listen to them it won't happen, but whatever a revive isnt that OP especially considering that you need to heal the chars assap or they stay downed"
" @Rikuhh  Her revive isnt broken yes youre right. 

But the issue is quite literally just one character ahead of us in development. Look at Phainons beta testing leaks"
"leave to anaxa mains to be upset about “oh they nerfed him” “its bias for castorice” and say dumb shit but when tribbie got nerfed everyone online was like “oh haha shes worse than robin om om om”.  characters are nerfed things happen, anaxa isnt even a bad unit but leave it non tcers to be slow n dumb."
" @woahitsfranco5286  Yeah except Trib is like literally the best Support on the game rn with M0R1 tied with Robin. 

Anaxa on release will be subpar and only good on cas BiS not even with that much advantage over other characters in said slot."
im still not sure why nerfing a character people actually like would make more money for them
"​@seaberrysvideodump9602

Worse character means you have more of an incentive to pull for the META in the near future + focus more on the other banner during the patchtime"
"""Tldr"" then proceeds to write a whole paragraph 😭"
Also doesn't she have a team-wide RES PEN buff as well in her base kit? That's already OP for a DPS and then they overload it with this passive. Oh and Hyacine is gonna maker her even stronger.
"yo thanks for this comment, it explains alot for me"
 @Stepperino it’s a fucking thesis
 @MegaMeister123  what’s phainon's global passive?
"Remember, Castorice was the most first hyped character even before released of Amphoreus.. she got the most many fans than all Chrysos Heir cast.. so she is give a special status from maker..❤"
​ @woahitsfranco5286 they was male simper..😅
"Genuine question, since you seem to have come to the conclusion yourself partly: why not just get used to it? We can’t change anything, so it’s better to change our frame of thinking. MOC top floors is for whales, it’s better to enjoy events, have fun by changing from character to character to character every few months. Essentially, have the mindset of a casual. It’s much easier this way and you’ll be much happier instead of fearmongering or complaining about something you can’t change."
"""Tldr"" Words used to mean something 🙏😭"
"Because this game is something enjoyable.

And I think that the global passives that are coming will make not just the entire endgame content overtime worsen, but its just a clear sign that HSR managers dont care about the community and forsaken how they get their money.

This also has a deeper meaning to me because in the last decades consumers stopped boycotting especially for electronic purchases and this will be another big step either for or against the direction its going.
​ @cCO2324 "
This is not a TLDR 😭
 @Vonfafa3  it is when instead of 20 paragraphs I formulate it into one shorter one that takes less than 10s to read
" @cCO2324  Weird my other message didnt send

My issue is with people who are either delusional in the sense that Hoyo cares about user experience more than their money making or even anywhere near equal.

Its not just an issue with Hoyo but with every game that I played (mostly shooters) where the studios slowly turn the game into worse and worse experiences just for the sake of ripping of consumers. Im sure youre familiar with what happened to COD, every new release gets worse than the other and everytime people still cannot boycott the game and instead keep buying skins for whatever reasons. 

This issue of people not being able to boycott games is a tragedy in my eyes and needs to be clear to everyone in our society, be it from any country on any continent that has ever existed."
"I completely agree with your opinion on boycotting games, people really aren't capable of letting go of a few PNGs to get better treatment later (and in gacha games getting better treatment usually also means more resources to get characters, so you really only need to send the message once and then wait for reruns)

I'm one of the people that really liked Castorice, both story and design-wise, but I'm absolutely not pulling for her; I think we're very few people but we'll at least try to send some kind of message (and I hope more people will join)

And let's not even get started on the repercussions that not being able to even boycott a game has on real world events rn, because holy shit do I despise people for some things"
that's a horrible TLDR 😂
 @MegaMeister123  imma need a specific source for that one bc i literally cannot find it at all
" @MegaMeister123  You are just lying here. There is no leaks on Phainon getting one at all. Him being a male makes this 0% because Hoyo just straight up doesn't like husbandos and prefers waifus since they sell more. If you got, just send the link here."
"A passive is something like Ruan Mei's spd buff or Herta's crit buffs

A global passive is when the character just has to be on the account to activate"
The HSR team were definitely high when they thought up the global passive for Castorice. Why make it global and not just in her team
"​ @paulyvii nah they even doubles down and it's definitely not getting changed 
Yes this is either the start of the game's downfall OR the playeebase will basically be cut in half those who Want global passives and those who absolutely despise it (like me)"
​ @paulyvii  maybe bcs she will become Demigod.. kinda like Emanator
 @paulyvii  Favoritsm pretty much
" @manoharalisa5829 we’ve gotten three other playable demigods,and they have nothing like this"
"​ @paulyvii maybe they're planning on releasing a character that has the ability to give massive buffs to resurrected characters 😬
and worse if its once more global lol"
I think it's because she's technically the new death god of amphorius she just omnipresent in that way IG (depending on how the story goes anyways). But even then I feel like the passive should only work when you're in amphorius or on an amphorius stage
"I was at a con recently many HSR cosplayer to love for the game despite Castorice.
To even Clara's VA being there"
"So in game she is actually stronger than in lore, quite a rare sight"
 @Flamelance_Accendo  if this was really about lore than it should be literally impossible to die as long as Blade is on your team
@Danny-mp8dq  That was properly illustrated with people having solo videos of him tbh..
"@ If you're speaking for when she gets her ""other half"", then maybe so. As for it being limited to Amphoreus, idk about that. I think, to be fair, it should be just limited to her being in your team and not out of it."
"she is the godness of death, who should guide the fallen to their forever resting realm.

but her passive ""delay"" death?😂 we all know that is not ""delay"""
​ @Dn1el075  she will ascended as Demigod.. her status got higher later..
"​ @Danny-mp8dq  in lore she win againts Blade .. only Acheron can defeat Castorice.. 
Nihility Emanator vs Death Demigod"
​ @thanh5703  and she actually embrance life in lore.. she not want to bring death ..
" @manoharalisa5829  later? ""Before"" may be? She just a dead ""goddes"" of a dead planet right now."
She's gonna take the Coreflame of Death so
"If you die in endgame and did revive via Castorice passive, it still counts as death, so it's borderline useless in moc, pf, and as. Lol. Before you yap, at least research. Having hate fomo will not heal your skill issues."
" @manoharalisa5829  blud forgot the part where an actual emanator prevents blade from dying, whereas the gods of amphoreus aren't actual cosmic gods, maybe emanators at best"
"It's still use full for PF and As, since to get full star you just need to get a high score, not like MoC where you need to keep everyone alive @drunkvader "
"Its should be that she need to be in the other side of the stage. What i mean is for example is PF, yout first half is a himeko team, and the second half is a castorice team, well both of those teams can get revived, but only on one of them. If your himeko dies, no revive for castorice teammate"
Do people suddenly not die just because Castorice isn't near them? Use your head before you talk about some shit lore take
"The passive making people wanting to pull her more is exactly the problem with global passives, it would be a different thing if she had to be on the team"
"Um... Leaks already show phainon has a global passive, he has a day and night cycle to all modes in the game; i dont remember what the day cycle buff was, but night is a free 10% crit rate"
Only 10%?
​ @Ghosty2098  if it stays like that where the buff stays small then the global buffs aren't that bad
 @callmefried544 10% is a lot
"@callmefried544  yeah, its nit game breaking"
"Welp, i have bad news for you. Because it seems from leaks that the devs are planning to add more global passives, the ones that are basically confirmed it seems are a speed boost and a flat atk boost. The devs are clearly willing to exploit this predatory mechanic as much as possible, so complaints need to be made as soon as possible so this doesn't become a standard."
 @Ghosty2098  wait there is more global passive ? can you hint me another one ?
 @codyhax0995  source?
She kills people in her lore. She doesn't fucking revive them.
 @codyhax0995  no other global passives have been leaked. youre believing fake leaks
" @callmefried544  
1. 10% crit rate is in no means small. Its literalyl 2 highroll critrate rolls for free FOREVER
2. global buffs are over time. When they release 20 characters over the next 3 years and even just half of them have this calibre of passive skills, you will feel it in your account and thus you will feel it if you dont have them. 
And that means the devs will have to take that into consideration for the future. You will have harder fights because of this"
 @Ghosty2098  This just isn't true
@tyran8165  it is tho 💀
​​ @callmefried544 10% crit rate without even being on party for entire team is not really small. When it's almost 1/3 of a Cr piece or 3-4 roll on a single piece. Like people still use fuxuan for 15 Cr so they can run CD piece instead of Cr piece so it actively reduces amount of grind needed for better gear and allow some units to run CD piece and that is assuming it doesn't stack with future passive
" @callmefried544  10% crit rate is still a crit substat that rolled 2 times, it is game changing for everyone that doesn't farm relics like it's a job."
" @callmefried544  
10% isn't small by any means. It's basically 2-3 Crit Rate substats.

It's enough to free up space for other stats like Crit DMG, ATK%, HP%, and BE.

If that's stuck to a global passive, players who have Phainon will have an obvious advantage on building their characters. They'll be able to give their characters an extra 20% Crit DMG and a 10% ATK (more or less). That's not ""small""."
 @Ghosty2098  Where a theses leaks cause i havent seen anything
" @Ghosty2098   proof: I made it up (Seriously, leakers don't have access to leaks above 1-2 patches, and phainon aint coming anytime soon)"
"If the leak is not on hsr leaks reddit, it's not reliable."
I won't believe leaks I've been Burned by that before and if they do start adding more global passives then I'll definitely leave HSR won't be Worth the hassle at that point
 @ChrisFoster-i3t they don’t exist lol it’s just ppl trying to fear monger and doompost . if these were real leaks they would’ve been posted in the leak subreddit
​ @Ghosty2098  phainon was the MC on Amphoreus so he surely gets too
 @callmefried544  10% only seems small but 10% for every single character is massive. Now characters can give up some of the crit rate stat and pushing more into crit dmg or atk
" @Ghosty2098 there was absolutely no leak that suggested Phainon having a global passive, that’s just lying."
 @Ghosty2098  Source: Trust me bro
 @princekili1027  I know they be pissing me off
"​ @Ghosty2098  where are your sources 💀

I've been scouring twitter and reddit for leak bc I really want to know Phainon's full kit but I couldn't find them yet."
​ @Ghosty2098 who leaked it? Is it a reliable leaker or just a Phantylia?
"I don’t get it… Can’t you just play through the story and leave it at that? Whether you spend money or not is completely your choice, even if the game tries to push you into it. Story will never require premium units or signature light cones..."
all gacha games are gona have something people dont like wait for wuthering waves to come out with something im gona laugh my ass off power creep is in every game ive ever played good luck all just play the game you like i mean we all want better for the games we play but that takes a movement in the community and it has to hit hard i mean you are only gonna get so many wins and these companies arent just gonna give away ther best stuff it isnt just hoyo its all games by the way ive played alot of games and i kno exactly where people are coming from its like when a game first come out its good cause thers no power creep and then as time goes by thers hp inflation and characters coming out that can handle that which leaves the old ones in the dust its in all games thers always a better character coming out
"Good i left this game the moment 3.0 started, cuz it felt mid for me :P And powercreep was tiring as hell, few patches ago player do perfectly endgame with some characters and then it seem my best units dont have dmg at all.... Well there is a way to have units ""fresh"" longer. Like get e6 5star event unit and its all work somehow. My friend got kafka e6 on her first banner and when i still played in last patches of 2.X she still did not that badly, but well... for f2p getting e6 is just too hard, work only if u skip few patches :P And now i see global passives... dont have a question, if dialogue walls without skips werent bad enought :P A little late comment, cuz wasnt rly interested in game for quite a bit time but saw this material as it showed up on my recommended ;) Nice material bro"
"This video aged like old milk. Where is the flood of Global Passives in hsr? HSR failed SO hard it made 100k million dollars? They made that on the Castorice banner on MOBILE ALONE! EOS soon?

This video, and many like it, sound like a salty break up letter to their ex."
"Castorice didn't break the game.
Acheron did"
"banner #2 and 2 characters kit leaked after Castorice released, still no other characters with Global Passive...where are the Global Passive that everyone was crying for?"
"Took you people long enough to open your eyes to see Hoyo's greed.

I realized this the moment genshin launches with that sh!tty 0.5% rate and long ass intro + unskippable story before you can pull the 1st gacha, punishing the rerollers. At that moment I decided not to invest any time in Hoyo games, and I guess I made a right decision."
"Y'all playing gacha games? Just play AAA game and its better like rdr 2, cyberpunk, ghost tushima"
"I believe Wuthering Waves will kill Honkai Star Rail, or at least force them to listen and change to a more friendly approach. All thanks to WuWa, it already happened to Genshin."
"""the fall of honkai: star rail""
meanwhile hsr just made over 100million from the Castorice banner lol
and now the fate collab is fully revealed and saber/archer's drip got over 100k likes on JPN twitter"
"It's really a shame, this game was good, people loved it. Now look at where it has come. Still not gonna drop it though."
"Even tho I don't play star rail anymore, its a real shame to see it dying... The Character designs, the animations , the story .. everything were top notch ..  if only it wasn't a turn based game .. not to mention the powercreep tho 😭"
"W, this is player friendly ☝️"
"enjoy ur fking wuwa""s money xD nigs:face-blue-smiling: 24 characters banners XDD"
I just don't care about Castorice at all. I'm skipping her and pulling for Anaxa instead.
It's far from death and the Old Character buffs Look great.
If in the future all new heros get a global it doesnt matter. Its just another passive
"I mean just like implanting your own weakness, it’s something that just completely fucks the weakness system. Silver wolf did it, but it was what made her special, then firefly, who had a sad backstory, fan favorite, and cool mech animations, basically hsr’s new poster girl for a while. And then weakness went downhill with characters like boothill and fugue. Castorice is just firefly all over again, sad story, cool animations, fan favorite, new poster girl, and rule breaking mechanic."
How do people believe this nonsense?😂 Some of the players do this every hoyoverse game when ever their mad about something in the game.
😂
Which is why I avoid these kind of CCs. Everytime their take about hoyo is 100% false.
 @AceVortux  but money suddenly = good quality if wuwa switches place with hsr and earns more than 100m am i right 😂
 @AceVortux  I feel like many people get dismissive of Mihoyo games' success tbh. I think Hoyo games are mid but they are popular for a reason and a lot of people enjoy them.
"​ @AceVortux  You are missunderstangin something here, people leave Hoyoverse game for WuWa not because they don´t listen to feedback, but because of free stuffs. WuWa have been giving tons of free stuffs for players than Hoyoverse while that is a good idea to get players attention it also backfired in WuWa 1st anniversary, on WuWa 1st anniversary players was upset about the free stuff, they wanted more since they already received those as normal free stuffs, the problem escalated so fast that cc who loved WuWa started to make drama videos about WuWa, their discord was flooded of rages and even the game rating was going down in some stores, that´s what happens when you spoiled too much a kid, now imagine what will happen if 2nd anniversary won´t have more free stuff than 1st anniversary.
WuWa is not as good quality game as some people think because:

lots of free stuff ≠ game has good quality

lots of free stuff = how many people want to be spoiled

pd: Im not saying WuWa combat and exploration is not better it´s good but Kuro is spoiling too much their players with too many free stuffs."
w mika pfp
"​ @AceVortux  Lol I can also say those revenue in wuwa is also how much money that Kuro has exploited from players, or saying all the income that any games made exploits the money of players. That's a dented take. 
It's simple, ppl like Castorice then ppl spend on her, plus that with the amount of players in HSR has."
"Ok I’m going to be one of those guys. For the record I just started playing. But, it’s a gotcha so isn’t this kinda thing expected? And 2 isn’t this a single player game? As long as you can keep beating end game content why is a global passive such a big deal? Also I pulled her and the passive has never been a make it or break it thing so far."
I will wait for ethira restart in june cuz the pulls is way generous not like this hoyo greedy dev
"Bro i know that global passive is really bad but why are people ignoring other problems like the horrible dog shit yapfest story,shity boss design,shit endgame. The global passive alone didn't ruin the game the game was already bad"
"It went from ""Genshin could never"" to ""Genshin is better"", WILD"
Tbh i have castorice and the only times her passive activated was in her team so that goes to show it should have just been exclusive to her team alone 😂
"""Castorice Global Passive Breaks The Entire Community, Dead Game""

Me, beating Hoolay to death with a half-assed E0 Lingsha: Say what?"
So for anyone that is looking for an alternative for HSR I would recommend looking into Etheria Restart. It's an HSR style turn based gacha. It also has an equalized PvP mode. Just wanted to let anyone who wants to fight back but loves HSR gameplay know
"I find it funny that He's talking about broken trust when the devs are known to NOT be trustworthly. Glad I never touched that game. Hoyo is a company selling casino. ""Create a problem. Sell the solution"". It's the motto of that company. Genshin, HSR, ZZZ, everytime.

6:05 spineless, coward ppl doing cowardly stuff. No surprise here sadly. The majority of streamers can't control themselves and need to spend/pull for characters. gambling at its worse because it normalize it."
"idk why u even played hsr in the first place lol. it literally doesnt have a combat, its a heartstone wannabe, and all ccs for it are morons"
"Frankly my love for this game dissipated after Belobog anyways, the game was never good after the initial release and I’m thankful I uninstalled halfway through v3.0 as I too enjoy spending my free time on games that are headed upwards not lore-rich exposition dumps that suck my pockets for everything they possibly can."
Arknight Mentioned Yippie
"Dawg every gacha is like this lmao. It all becomes stupid, they can also just make the enemy unkillable too if they wanted"
"I dont care since i already have like 10 top tiers, when am i supposed to die at this point?"
"Shit, its 3.4 now on play store"
"I truly, TRULY hope that Kuro Games will never go down the same route as Hoyoverse. To me, they're like the light at the end of the tunnel, the final bastion of good will, honor, and respect. If they EVER veer off the dark end, I will no longer trust or play any gacha games ever again. Never again, would i be emotionally manipulated to pull for characters, never again would i feel FOMO, never again would i fall for the same trap that I've already fallen for 3 times already because of all the sweet, sweet empty promises they make."
Try arknights it's a shit game too but if you use reading skills and have strategical thinking in tactical map you good
Wuwashills on their way to post their EIGTH video this month dissing on Honkai/Genshin 💀
I was one of the last people that knew of her kit I planned on pulling for castorice because her design so I don't really care about the passive her damage is crazy and she has a pet dragon I'm having fun playing her.
"I got castorice with 1 pull and quit, it was my last one, still I was like: lmao, naaah"
1:22 LIKE WHAT!?
They got backlash when pgr came to global and that made them understand that west people like the game to be f2p
"That aged… not exactly the best. At the end of the day, no company, corporation or game is your friend.  No company is a “final bastion” or “light at the end of the tunnel”, they just want one thing and that’s whatever’s sat in your bank account."
You're just an idiot Hutao simp😂 Hoyo games will become whale only if people like you will keep defending this shit
"Personally, these practices have made me view Hoyo as hyper-predatory. 

But I did attempt to consider a possible solution (that could work specifically in HSR). 

They could update older characters with worthwhile global passives. They could give Gepard either a plus 20% HP, or a 15% damage reduction, or the the first time a character on your team would take lethal they gain a one-time invulnerability/shield (so they don't need reviving). 

But unless the game applies this, or a tower-passive system, as suggested by Tectone, I don't think I'll be playing HSR anytime soon."
"I won’t get my hopes up but it would be a nice thing to see if things can make a turnaround for HSR, because it was really great and I remember when the community was unanimously enjoying everything about it. 

It’s sad to see how divided the community is right now."
"i have been a HSR player since version 1.1, i have been off and on a low spender, but after all this shit, in the anniversary patch foreword i will be going f2p, i pulled Castorice (with saved up pulls, i did not spend money) because i enjoy her character (aside from the global passive), i am still somewhat invested in the story so that is why i won't outright quit the game (yet at least), but i started WuWa 2 weeks ago today for Zani and i will be a low spender in WuWa instead, i am enjoying WuWa despite being mediocre at action games"
"Entire community more like western ones, bro its called gacha for a fcking reason. Theres a limit in playing F2P in Gacha games bro."
Only Kuro can save us i hope that they'll make turn based game like HSR
"Genshin: I'm uninstalling it cuz Mualani is white.
Hsr:"
Man😢😢😢
"Cant wait to see revenue result... Lets see how dead the game really is or is just some cry drama youtube gremlins who care about meta in pve rpg game. 
With my free account i can still beat everything and i dont care shit of 0 cycle or stuff like that."
Star Rail turned me off the moment they brutally killed off the beautiful vixen Tingyun right in our faces...
This is the best passive.  We need more passives
"Thank god we are getting free ruan mei because even if she gets a rerun she is easy at top 3 most pulled units so they don't even get much from her rerun anyway XD This passive beside concept is actaully not that big but if you have more than 12iq you know it will get worse soon. Hsr have so much problems that it's insane. Anniversary has the same amount of pulls as previous patch, gearing characters is disgusting, we have 2 events per version and nothing to do, story telling is terrible, white text on black screens, dialogues are bloated af, buffs to older character are coming in 3 months (nice job multibilion dollar company), new characters kits are locked behind lc way more than before. When people said that acheron needs her lc when she could use gnsw s5 was funny, now look at mydei, casto or hyacine that is coming next patch. I actually think that passive is a cherry on top of the cake, but the cake is made of sh*t XD"
"""the Entire Community"" being few toxic lil shits from EN CC's community, ok bro funny joke KEKW"
guess why pgr and wuwa never fall? cuz its never rise
So many 🍼 😭
"Sure, sure, sure... In a month, it'll be like nothing ever happened, maybe even less. It’s not like this hasn’t happened multiple times already.
People will keep playing, people will keep paying. That won’t change, no matter what you say or think.
Keep this comment in mind for the next HoYo drama, maybe then you’ll think for yourself instead of just going with the flow."
Here is the deal: you either get Castorice global buff and you enjoy it or all enemies in the game get +1000% HP buff.
A Chinese player pulled 88 copies of Castorice to get reroll dice for gear so he has a good built.This game cannot and will not be saved.
"The fact that they made her so broken in hopes of players just being like “f it” but still kept her global passive is disgusting. They’re just like “Yeah, you should pull this super powerful character, and haha, you just gave in to our decision : P”, because they literally made it so you don’t have to do a single thing to reap the benefits of her passive. They’re literally saying “Yeah, just spend money getting her, we don’t give a sht what you do with her tho.” It’s just awful…"
Can you make the rise and fall of the game
Doing my part! Game-wise I'm Hoyoless starting from HSR 3.1. Best decision ever.
$100m 😂😂
More that devs listen and for pgr it's peak right now many free units and dmc collab
"@Sky-8754  pgr is ok, its fun but guess what? wuwa will become what  genshin look like right now after 1 or 2 year..."
@takuto8243  it won't the first anv has like rewards like free limited 5 star and limited weapon selector this is kuro and they know if there players are happy they will spend in the game kuro makes more money from skin in pgr then character as you can get every units plus that we got blue banner reset next patch with a banner that gose up to nanami that will stay for a long time also we are getting a free S ranks back to back
" @Sky-8754  that only the first aniv, i dont have any problem with pgr but do you remember the globle release of pgr? Its was a mess, they are greedy as hell back then, they learn form that bro, if they get more money like hoyo did they will maybe change? Who knows...hoyo used to be great the first any of genshin is great, but what are they now? Everything change"
 @takuto8243  they are getting money that true but the devs learned that if the player base is happy the game will stay alive and people will play it just hoyo has not faced that same thing once they do they might also do that but it might be to late for them
"Changes? Community voice? What do you mean? Hoyo never heard. Hoyo never cared.

So you can't push back. You can't do anything."
"Well i can totaly understand the people that fear that more global passivs come to the game, i wouldnt be so happy about it either, but if i look at how weak the revive from Castorice is, it could be that the upcoming global passivs first sound as big as the one from Castorice, but are just as weak in reality or Hoyo just makes it a 1 time thing and just wanted to make a unique gimmic to their new 5 star Waifu, i dont say i find the letter likely, i just think of what can happen"
Aged really well. Kurogame just silently censoring wuwa
"I would've like for you to highlight, how hoyoverse made every attempt at silencing the community when they tried to pick up this topic.
Whenever players tried to voice their concern about global passives, they got cenzored and their voices snuffed out.
Posted on reddit? - Moved to an unused megathread/banned you for your toxicity.
Sparked a topic on discord? - Banned.
Commented on any youtube video on hsr channel? - Comment deleted.

They hired people, to silence thoose who had concern. They banned freedom of speech. That is just too far gone.

But even then, players still have their two most powerful weapons in their arsenal.
Don't spend.
Don't play.

Cheers for reading. I didn't spend a dime on that accursed patch."
How to kill a game - make it a pay 2 win game
1:29 Dragon Unleashed jumpscare
A global passive that allows you to skip cutscenes WOULD BE INSANE 😂
game is not gonna die. castorice will revive it.
Man😢😢😢😢
"I'll be blunt, I never really liked Gacha Smack. He always came off as somewhat pretentious and rather uninformed about various topics regarding HSR. But I digress. 

It is really disappointing to see all of this drama unfold. I am a day one player and pretty much viewed HSR as my true to form favorite gacha. But, it seems that you really can't trust a gacha company. Shouldn't be surprising, but still. This game gave a lot of great memories and amazing characters to love. Castorice is also a character I care for, but it's a shame that she's the face of all this turmoil. Either way, while I'm not ready to just straight up quit HSR, I at least want to see how bad the game will get in regards to these global passives. Until then, it'll be just passive log ins for stuff and not much engagement as I shift into F2P. Almost all gacha fall into the trappings of power creep eventually, but it seems that Hoyo sort of missed the forest for the trees when it came to this recent chapter. Ironically, for once, it seems that Hoyo somehow dropped the ball in HSR more than Genshin. I can only pray that ZZZ doesn't suffer from this down the line. But only time will tell."
Amazing
"I'm not talking about the game anymore because i refuse to give momentum to this, im playing girls Frontline 2 now and occasionally watch YouTubers who didn't pull for that damned girl"
pgr and wuwa could never
"Yea, HSR wont fall because of a toxic players. Lol. You all think you have so much power here when you have none at all."
"the moment the passive came, the game was too far gone. Good day to any one still playing."
Why are they complaining? They are playing hoyo games…they expect gonna be treated with respect?? Dump faks
"I had to disinstall for 3 months and I had no idea about all this, I came back because I was curious about Amphoreous and R-TB and I wanted Castorice. Yes I was a bit shocked about her passive when I found out but as a day zero player of hsr, I never spent a dollar and I'm still here because I enjoy the story and the general aesthetic of the game."
"It's not that big of an issue tbh, the powercreeps are available in most of the gacha games so I don't find it that bothering to me"
"Lol boycott failed. And goodbye to the garbage ""content creators"""
"Game started going to shit since 2.0 and nothing changed
Nothing will change regardless how people complain"
If everybody knows it is not silently.
"because it was good at one point in time. this take is so stupid it's just like saying ""you move to chicago, you shouldn't be upset that you got mugged and shot last night, it comes with the territory."" like yeah, the association is there but that doesn't fucking make it right, and when Star rail does this bullshit it sets a precedent for other companies to be even more anti-consumer and predatory. don't be a hoyo shill or a corporate dick sucker."
You should at least try to explain the WHOLE skill. Otherwise it's just stupid clickbait.
"why even create drama over a frikin global passive? yes it can potentially lead to future characters having global passive which may pressure players to swipe if they do not have enough pulls. BUT isn't that what happens everytime?? characters powercreep other characters and its just a natural part of the cycle. Furthermore, this ""global passive"" is unlocked at E0, you LITERALLY only have to pull 1 COPY! IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GOING FOR E6! hsr ALSO gives enough funds for players to pull a character every patch, not to mention this patch is an anniversary patch so this might even be a 1 time thing (who KNOWS?? JUST A THEORY I'M PUTTING OUT THERE). But the point is, how bad can 1 SINGLE COPY OF A CHARACTER HURT YOUR WALLET?? 

and lets be real here, HSR is a fckn turn based game. THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH mechanic you can introduce to a turn based game before it starts to become BORING. Y'all should be greatful that they do stuff like this to make things interesting, because if not then y'all would complain that ""the game is too boring"" or ""too repetitive"". :/"
"This is just some naive person talking, The minute you you started paying Genshin Impact 5 years ago you know you are on a  ""Pay to win"" ship.. Its all about money ... Same for every company, You think they make game or product for free ?
If you don't like it stop playing, simple.. Or make video that arouse poeple hate and get more stream and views before quiting. END OF STORY"
I liked how the game once felt like you could built any team. But as when a mmo became pay to win i leave
It sounds like a virus hacking your game data
HSR could never
I just roll castorice and is just very good character :v don't understand why people hate it that much
The hoyocucks just never learns
"I hope this won't aged like a fine wine but back in the day genshin rots while HSR thrives now HSR rots while ZZZ thrives. I hope this is not a domino effect because if this is a pattern, ZZZ is next while they release a new game."
I'm the only one among my friends who seems to care about the global passive and how bad a precedent this will set for insane powercreep and HP inflation/armor stack enemy mechanics.
It’s not even PvP😂  skill issues keep crying lol
Seriously if cipher didn't exist i would have deleted this game its so dead right jow
"When i entered the game, the first thing that i see is nothing but Castorice and an invitation to pull... no man, i know this type of games are predatory in essence, is their business model, but let me go in to the game before you start to shove the cash grab down my throat... not going to uninstall,  but i will not spend more money on it... I want to finish the current story and then we will see where all is and what i will do then. 

I will throw my pulls to Anaxa because i like the guy... but it would be so funny if i don´t get it, like being kicked while already on the floor."
Lol he already back to Honkai Star Rail
"Bro, Pokke video when?"
More like viewers fall off 😂
"Imagine looking toward box for consistency and principles, might as well build a bridge out of wet toilet paper :v"
"It's unfortunate that Gachasmac is the exception regarding showing self-control and self-respect when you're disrespected or blatantly ignored. If that behavior of walking away from such a luxury as a game was standard, companies wouldn't be faqing over their audiences nearly as frequently especially when they have time to course correct with feedback before implementing such a divisive thing."
"There is just a lack of things to do in game, there are only about 2 events each patch now."
I quit playing this game. I'll just wait for Kuro to make a turn based game like HSR.
"It is not about the E0 or the money it is the fomo that it would give players, think if every character would get global passive like this from now on how many EO you would need to collect every single time,people are not afraid of castorise people are afraid of the future of this game, because literally they crossed a line which even hoyoshills can't defend now, thank god I invested in genshin instead of hsr, at least genshin does not have this problem, if genshin does this, I will quit the game then and there."
"one reason more to pull her, got her and her lc today and i had very much much fun"
"Ngl i havent played HSR since the end of Belibog so i have no horse in this race and after watching so many HSR CCs cave or do a 180 on Castorice I now hope her banner breaks records. Simply because itll be a clear signal to Hoyo to open the flood gates on global passives and i want to see just how insane the devs will get with them. Like in 6 mos will there be half a dozen, a dozen maybe even more global passives in the game, and just how broken will future GPs be? 

Imo, in a vacuum Castorices GP isnt that game breaking but what about one that gives every team +20% CR or +35 Speed and if hoyo does go that far with powerful GPs will content be balanced around those GPs to the point where if you dont have most of the characters with GPs will even mid-level content will be a struggle?

Maybe if this was done by another company, one that had a good track record when it comes to balancing monetization and fomo with being f2p friendly and providing an overall good experience for all players id have more faith that GPs wont get out of hand. But this is Hoyo who has pretty much the worst track record out of any of the bigger gacha companies. 

My only fear is that if the GPs are highly successful then other devs will borrow the idea  but i tend to be way more picky about the gacha devs who games i play and the gachas i currently play all have devs who have proven they want to make video games first and keep the monetization reasonable so that theu make more than enough money but they also dont feel the need to squeeze their playerbases for every dime. Also i feel hoyo know that their core player base are mostly children with undeveloped fromtal lobes or lobotomized adults so they can do the most predatory things in their games and their players will still eat up all the slop Hoyo tosses their way."
I played hsr october of 2024 and the only reason i still play is im waiting for the game to keep me hooked like belobog did... And im getting impatient.. devs got lazy 🥲
We hope that the square will realize sooner of what he did. Hoping he will move on
"""the fall of hsr, the fall of genshin, the fall of zzz"" meanwhile each game consistently has over 30m players and revenue still top on the revenue reports
next year: ""why hoyo games are still alive and high revenue and playercounts mean nothing""
the cope is real among hoyo haters lol"
"Gacha gamers are addicts (gambling addicts to be precise).

 And hoyo knows it. 

Would you have faith in a gambler when he says he will quit. 

They can't even if they want to. They need rehabilitation.

To be frank, gacha gamers (gambling addicts) are pushover, and true whales are bigger pushover, and they are the main money source for gacha game (slot machine) to be frank gacha game (slot machine) has to be ban permanently i expect that this gacha gamer (gambling addicts) to resort to crime in the real world wait they already did. And i also i expect the extremity of the crime level to increase. Gambling addicts so as gacha gamers the more they gamble, the more they morale degrade. So expect the worst.

I dont know why guys r surprised"
"No amount of ""look, everyone! We made another SPECIAL waifu!"" is going to save this game. No amount of attention, backstory, and video promotion or animation they put into Castorice would make the rating sympathize with her, damn."
Hoyoverse is in a whole sh*t hole rn and I think we all saw this coming
but... someone still plays hsr today?
The banner also made top 1 in pretty all the Asia regions lol....
"The amounts of doomposting and pessimism i have seen across all HSR platforms in the past month has been ridiculously F---ing stupid and endless.

Like, it's just ONE character. Like her? Roll. 
Don't like her? Skip.
I personally skipped her for Jiaoqiu although i might try getting her.

""But da passive!""

Weren't you guys complaining about HP inflation earlier and ridiculous boss DPS?
Here's your current solution, Casotrica.

""B-but da future implications!""
Lmao it's not that serious. you can STILL perfectly play and enjoy the game without Castorice or future passive characters.

Every game evolves throughout the years that units years ago looks barely recognizable, it's only a natural cycle. We're slowly evolving, of course they're gonna add stuff instead of the usual stuff — anyhow, stop being pessimistic crybabies and enjoy the game.

Edit: i WISH i could stop seeing people saying they deleted the game or will quit or do vids/posts about wanting to quit.

Like, no one cares lil bro"
"Entertaining drama, i got bored of tectone lately"
time to wait for kuro to make  a hsr type game its only a matter of time
"This is so sad man. Legit, the gacha community (to my knowledge) is the only space that actively can’t unite on a common goal. Helldivers 2 and even LEAGUE OF LEGENDS were able to unite and protest against things they didn’t like. It sucks seeing people fighting over some moral high ground that doesn’t really matter instead of uniting and fighting against blatant corporate greed."
"Well, HSR is a gacha game with a terrible company which is very much known now. You just gotta let it go because they don't seem to be stopping at any point and why even play bad games when there are different genres with over 5 millions of games that you might like. All you have to do is try it like how you tried HSR and fell in love with it.

I'll be sharing my favorite games with y'all if you're interested and want to take a break from Gacha genre.

God of War series (1, 2, 3, Ghost of Sparta, Chains of Olympus, Ascension, 2018 and Ragnarok), Ghost of Tsushima, Assassin's Creed (2, Brotherhood, Revelations, 3, Black Flag, Origins), The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, Watch Dogs (1, 2, Legion), Sleeping Dogs, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Kingdom Hearts (I fucking loved 2 because of INSANE COMBAT MECHANICS), Batman Arkham Knight and finally Witcher 3.

Happy gaming, folks!"
"Sadly, it's not the fall of starrail. The game is going to continue, and people will still play it. If castorice makes you unhappy, just quit the game because complaining to Mihoyo won't do anything. They don't give a shit. As long as there are shills, they will continue forth."
The fact that the game now starts with a full screen ad for the new unit and has a top up event tells you all you need to know about the global passive
Glaive will you try black beacon?
"they didnt broke shit the so called Castorice (stupid name, i dont want to be castrated) is still getting pulled by tons of people
hopefully its over for honkai so they work on zzz"
Castorice’s passive effect isn’t that god damn bad I wish people would stop complaining
People still buy EA games so what's your point lmao
the anti hoyo cc and people love to deny statistics and tell you to focus on their opinions instead
​ @weakestBAenjoyer it's a pathetic sight. I don't play hsr anymore but some of these cc are so obnoxious and obsessive.
and a white screen with black text just to piss you off
"Lmao what is this supposed to do? 😂
At least they're doing something to promote the character instead of just putting it there. 

You bunch can't be grateful in any shape or form."
 @Pray2Herta   dude didnt watch the Castorice ads
​ @Pray2Herta  'doing something to promote the character' oh you mean they are so  desperate to sell the character they shove her right on your face when you open the game? Sure... promote indeed...
Why put it in the game if it's so insignificant. Think about it
"​ @rlstrength he said it's not bad. 

Do you have the attention span and comprehension skills of a goldfish lmao?"
It's like blud didn't even watch the video....
Sorry but what is CC mentioned in image 3:26?
I deleted the game after the livestream
"All i play now for gacha is Limbus Company and Wuwa, i dropped everything else especially mihoyo.
I'm playing my backlog of single player games i collected its time to play those and stop wasting my time on game basically will eventually die because company runs it is ruining it."
"still hate myself not dropping this turd in 2.1.  Glad i bailed in 3.0 dog shit writing, terrible powercreep, i had enough plus combat was getting stale they didn't bother adding extra button or mechanics to make combat more interesting."
"I'm scared with amounts of copium people consume with this game. My friend told that power creep is not that bad because she still use follow up fox lady and she is still good, but her banner was less than 7 months ago?
And then I wisited prydwen and the Herta already lost a whole tier. That's pretty much insane"
Did pull castorice and LC hope will get untill end of banner e2 👍
One of the things I hate the most about this is that Castorice’s global passive isn’t even as crazy as I thought in gameplay(if revivals were that good more people would use bailu) but the fact that they even entertained the idea means that they will likely do it again in future. Probably not anytime soon but it will happen again.
"okay boys, time to make black beacon famous so the next hoyo games have a 70 pity banners"
Well you really can’t tell people to not love the game. You know what players could do is by playing a different game and make it popular beating HSR.
Im still having fun playing hsr.
"Hoyo will keep this up, even zzz isn't safe."
hahaha I saw today castorice is a top sales in cn so guess what? hoyo doesn't give a fck about those people who whining about the global passive and they are going to do it again and again because people still spending money 😂
I respect Gacha Smack for quitting. It's a great undertaking for a CC to drop one of the biggest gacha.
"wow fall of HSR, but no.1 on  CN and JP IOS, too much drama farm"
Deserved for playing HSR tbh. Good luck letting the company decide what you pull on now.
"I got some free gems and golden tickets yesterday, never really played this game so i just spent them right away on the cute elf lady. Got her, so I looked up some builds. Apparently in the story she kills everything she touches? Ironic that this character is the one to kill her game."
Hmm i can imagine in the future that dodge parry mechanics will be global passive exclusive or atleast enablers. o7 it was a good run.
More interested in whats happening with March 7th than the world currently on.
not that bad tbh
"Genshin could never 🚫
Genshin should never ✅"
Content creators
"No one cares. 

Really."
genshin be like : not affecting by power creep and doesn't have global passive who destroy the game. The only problem with genshin right now is va drama but only for en 😂
Yeah no Genshin ALSO sucks let's not just forget these facts.
Genshin had fans begging for power creep complaining about how Lord Bennet and other launch 4 stars still dominate the game
 @PossessedbyPhoenix  lol no lmao. They didn't begging for power creep they just ask for another support like bennet so they can have 2 powerful support like him that they can use for both abyss stage. Like how people can use yelan and xingqiu who have similar gameplay
​@wekang1650 we did get a second bennet
" @Sky-8754  you mean iansan? nah she's not good enough actually with how little she heal is and she required a character to moving a lot, so I would not consider she a another bennet"
@wekang1650  same but she dose give the scroll set buff
 @AmirAbdullahShafin  Genshin could never really just became better due to hsr powercreep anyway genshin only has 2 years left so if makes sense that hoyo will not put that much love in that game anymore after which if there is no new game after ZZZ then hoyo might make hsr more f2p or ZZZ so they could stay in the global market hell if the free limited selector and weapon selector in wuwa 1st anv is true then it over for hoyo as they will need to do that to keep the player base or get reviewed boom and even CN players might see this being good and start to leave
​ @wekang1650 genshin went downhill IMO. 5.2 story ruined the game for me completely. And why the hell do they release a random cow instead of Capitano? I will never understand.
" @midnight.blue42  lol capitano still alive. Why they release varesa because varesa already in planned they already leak it long time ago in live stream. Genshin is not went downhill actually because gacha game on decline this year that's one of the reason why. 

You thought genshin went downhill because your favorite character is not playable but that's only your personal opinion. And we talk about power creep right now genshin still can balance it after 4 years that's impressive actually compare to hsr that only 2 years but the power creep keep getting worse."
mass quitting?  more like they'll be making 100m+  this patch
"All these problems wont exist if the age rating of all gacha gamea is M, so no one can blame anyone. Tbh, playing gacha game is basically gambling, like, no one blame casinos for being predatory"
Unninstaled Both Genshin and HSR while ago im just sad that both of these games keep damaging ZZZ too because its from same company
This age like a milk after her banner drop and making big ol revenue 😂
Hsr dead start after 3.0 because you know how was gayshit impact 5.0 same cycle dispointing 90% players 10 just shills who was happy with that. One the first day of 3.0 ik this is gonna happen and i was right here we're i deleted game and sold my account before the anniversary best choice but hsr was my fav hoyo game🥹🥹
"For me, if the gacha game no longer fun despite after spending money into it...
First, stop do any purchase whatsoever and go F2P. No more BP, no more Welkin or similar stuff.
2nd, try to use whatever character you have, to do what can in the game, see if it still do-able on how far the end game content is...
3rd if the game is no longer fun and feel chore to you, in which you keep asking yourself, ""I can play other game much better than this""... stop play and uninstall that game already and go play the game you been thinking about..

I do this on Clash Of Clan, Clash Royale, Raid Shadow Legend and few other gacha game which I already spent money in the game. By completely leave it be. Enough is enough.

From all this game I play and learn, after all this time, each company will do this kind of move. 
Which is 'Making' player the need to purchase something in the game to go through game content easier and faster.
It's just 'When'... and 'How'..

While what happen to HSR is.. sad but for me it's to be expected.
It was good while it last."
Wait till ZZZ fall like HSR. Since it's a Hoyo game. 💩
"This definitely aint the death of star rail lmao. I wouldnt be shocked if this is the highest sales theyve had. The store was even lagging last night lmao. CCs severley overestimate hour much movement they have lol. Gachasmack is not a ""big voice"" in the HSR space 🤣. No one cared he uninstalled, cause he didnt play the game. The mass ""uninstalls"" were again, people who already barely played. The reality of the situation, is that nobody actually gives a shit lol

5:53 these CCs never said ""i wont support this practice"". They just pointed out thst its bad, which is telling their audience to be wary and dont do it if you dont want to. But that doesnt mean they cant. They didnt rally troops. They just said ""yeah this sucks""."
"Those review bombed HSR still play and spend money, there ain’t no point in this shit anymore"
"I dont really get it, i just have one thing to say, people who spend money on the game will continue to do so and those who don't will not (I am an F2P) and as for the ""predatory practise"" then shouldn't all eidolons be considered that as well? (as they incentivise people to spend money on the game)

its just a game, play it if you enjoy it or don't. these are gacha games and this is nothing new. Gacha games are and have been like this from their inception."
"in my eyes, gacha games should just disappear for good!!"
"I personally don't see the problem with Castorice, the revive isn't at full HP so it's pretty easy to die lol"
"HSR has broken my heart. I was hooked since launch and truly felt something special in the game. I enjoyed it so much. (And for the record, did not whale. I was a light spender)

I stopped playing at the end of Penacony because I grew bored and burned out. I thought I would return when 3.0 came around... I'm so glad I didn't so I didn't have to see the slaughter of this game in person. What I see and hear about this game now is genuinely depressing, and it only get worse with time. I thought it was already dead when hearing about the new dps/supports... and then Castorice happened. What a waste of incredible potential... I'm genuinely very sad."
"I still play but now only as a side game, paying only battle pass and monthly pass (was paying as a bigger dolphin)
Wanna experience how it actually feels to not being able to clear MoC12 eventually even as I play daily."
"I quit HSR but I know the game won't lose popularity, players or money. The devs could do anything like you can use a character unless you have them E6S5 and people still will play and love it."
the fact that they added the 800% value packs shit is so sad
"The thing is hsr is a turn base game, it's not a hack and slash game where you can mald yourself until bald to clear the hard stage"
"At this point, Hoyoverse will become EA of gacha games."
It's HoyOver
2.9 in ph
You don't see how a strategy rpg built around having a team gets worse when the team is affected by units not in the team?
" @rlstrength  no i don't its a gacha bro ""strategy"" also includes managaing resources and pulling worthwhile characters.
Also its not like the game is unplayable without the revive."
"​ @RamandeepSingh-ml5kg You don't see the problem, what is stopping them from putting crit passive buffs in the future and the endgame will definitely be balanced around that and then it will be unplayable for the older units."
"@ i've played many gachas and have seen these concern multiple times but it has not stopped any gacha nor have any of such games become unplayable.

and let me reiterate planning your resources/jades is part of the game.

Also why has no one raised these concerns when half of the unit's kit are locked behind their eidolons? 

this is just my thought process on this matter if you dont agree then that's fine i am not here to dispute but just here to share my perspective."
" @RamandeepSingh-ml5kg  I understand your perspective bro, I think it's fine. But you need to accept that pay 2 win is a gradient. The game is unequivocally becoming ""more"" pay2win by introducing this, since there is now stricly more spectrum to invest in (before you were limited to full e6s5 team with perfect relics, now the ceiling will keep growing with passives). Agreed right now it's only slightly higher because who cares about the revive, but the way forward is there. They broke the ""the team is what is in combat"" rule.

You're right, eidolons were already pay2win. But there is even more pay2win now. Some people don't want the game to become even more pay2win. It's as simple as that.
I don't think we disagree, it's just a displacement on the gradient. If hoyo doubles the price for top up by your logic it doesn't change anything because it was already pay2win. But it would change the investment equation (ok maybe bad example, because it would only affect spenders, but I hope you get the point)"
" @RamandeepSingh-ml5kg  eidolons only make that specific character stronger, like any other gacha games out there, it's pretty much normal so nobody bats an eye. Meanwhile, global passive make your whole account stronger just by having the character, which means you'd be a fool for not doing whatever you can to get that if you're planning to play this game for a long time. Now this is Hoyo so surely they will implement new combat mechanics around said global passive, which will make the gameplay experience worse for those who don't have Castorice. Not to the point of unplayable, but worse nonetheless. That's the issue. 

And they won't stop at one."
"Even qiqi does this but if she is in the team, is castorise in the team?"
"If you are still paying for battle pass and monthly pass you are still supporting the game, I would only consider you are against the game now if you become f2p."
EA is like another level of greed.
"And then you also get the  ""but it's still making more money than your game"" or ""you don't even play the game """
Honestly how I felt just yea seeing the shilling for casto and Anaxa is just baggage and lack of events feels yea I want to cope for silvercunny buff but at this point no copium or hopium I’ll play the rest of the patch and if it just the same as 3.0 and 3.1 then yea just gotta accept and move on zzz is my last hoyo game that’s hanging on already quit jenshin years ago and now hsr
"I quit because of the spend money event and whale shop, while f2p little spenders get almost no events, one Ruan Mei dupe and 20 more pulls for anniversary!"
"You pull for Castorpo greed.

I pull for Zani.

We are not the same."
"yeah i couldnt even enjoy my foxian team of Feixiao, Fugue, Tingyun and Yukong for 5 minutes...feels like i pulled them for nothing, thankfully i still have my kitsunes in azur lane to pick me up"
I believe until there is no true competitor for HSR (like wuwa for genshin) the current state of HSR never changes
"What people have to understand, that it's not just Hoyo=bad, but ALL gacha companies are bad, yes even the new golden child Kuro too.
Do not trust them, they are not your friend, or small team of devs. These are corporations using predatory means to get as much money as possible, all ""good will"" is just a calculated facade to make sheeps believe they are the good guys.

Hoyo just became so big, that they don't need to fake it anymore and any other company will do the same, the moment they will get in big leagues."
Wasn’t castorice really good? I have seen her dragon has good animation and gameplay
Getting waterboarded with several new ways to spend MONEY when logging after months of subpar storytelling and powercreep left me feeling insulted...
"The only StarRail to me is on PGR
Nanami I'm coming for you!"
"It's not really the fall of the game. It's just a bunch of CC glazers who are making a big broohaha over nothing. Castorice's global passive doesn't make the game easier or harder. It's just an extra perk. The ""drama"" is just content farm."
This wouldn't be a problem if they approached the global passive mechanic differently instead of releasing it as a new character. I don't hate the concept just the execution
"Then the hoyo knights will keep defending this by mentioning ""free ruan mei or loucha"" or ""you can choose character to lose 50/50 to"".

Brother man, 1 year from now 2 million will be the norms for damage, healers now give 100% dmg shred by existing and support will give 200% res pen. Think!"
"All I wanna say is... 
well... gonna give it to hoyo for being a piece of sh*t that stir community into sh*tshow and bringing out the sh-tiest part of human being onto the surface... no one doing it like hoyo... I give them that."
"Hsr health and balancing of the game has been horrible since Acheron and only getting worse since then, doesn’t matter if the global passive is broken and game breaking bc in a few patches they will power crept it and inflate enemy hp even more so it doesn’t matter, most non-casual player know this and if they didn’t quit months ago this won’t make them and casual players don’t know it exists or don’t know the implications, only the loud minority on twitter and tiktok are saying they’re gonna quit bc of her passive and who knows how many are serious / how many will eventually come back away, hsr will be just fine 💀💀"
this is the first time i heard you calm and not crashing out like crazy  😂
"For me, it's just... i definitely frowned upon them more, tho I somewhat stopped playing because I could careless about Amphoreus since I just don't really care about god this and god that, 3.1 was good tho, I love more human story. It gave me  hope for Amphoreus, but rn I just don't vibe with it at all. On top of, HSR/Hoyo definitely knew that Ricegirl is the perfect seedbed because they're predominantly also Firemoth fanbase, and the ""waifu"" of Amphoreus thus if there's backlash there are waves of people that will defend them blindly or willingly. Perhaps both side exaggerating but nobody knows until few months or another year of HSR. The implication of future global passive just demotivated me more from playing, from just gonna play on weekends do the all the jade grinds, to not at all rn. Im kinda disappointed too since my best girl (Herta) just got upgrade into herself, which I love her simple yet effective design. E2 her (I didn't pull since 2.4) and nuke almost every endgame content easily. Right now, I'm not in a hurry to do the story or maybe I already departed, I still support and happy for those that still play this game, and may they enjoy it till then."
"When old gacha players were sh@ting on 50/50 and dups system in GI new guys called us entitled.
And this plague is in every new gacha now.
With each new wave other problem was sweep under rug.

How you thought that this time will be much different ?"
no more  clowns  youtubers  in game    is beater for  everyone
"new enemy skill: ""when a teammate is revived, ATK+10%"""
Gachas are just legalized gambling after all
"And it supposed to be anniv patch, and some of the event is pay able to enjoy😅😂"
Castorice  being the god of death brought the death of the game is a funny irony lmao
"MC says ""rules are meant to be broken"" so devs says ""our game our rules"". they gonna push this further and it will become norm and just a silent chirps from the past in the near distant future."
I watch this guy's videos then watch them again on Saintontas 😂
"Idfc, i love Castorice"
Castorice broke Tectone's balls
"I feel the drama is too exaggerated because people are mad because of future global passives. When we don’t even know if there will be another global passive character. You shouldn’t be mad at something that has yet to happen. There is zero confirmation of future global passives like speed or Crit damage or anything. Castorice global passive is balanced because people wouldn’t even need it normally. If your team is dying then your team isn’t working anyways.  Castorice passive tend to be only active regularly in her own team, in other teams characters with Aventurine or Lingsha, you wouldn’t die anyways. The drama will die down in a few months if Hoyo just never releases another global passive. And even if they do, they would do things like stats boost outside party because it would break the game and wouldn’t fit the lore."
"We're going to buff old characters, but we're also going to increase powercreep even more with global passives.
Improve the story? Wait 4 patches, in fact, it's better to wait 8 patches, we'll definitely improve it."
"I never gonna play any Hoyo games after what I pass through Genshin, sorry, those devs deserve the worst."
I'm even receiving threats saying Costa Rica could revive me if i don't stop playing.
Can’t wait for “The Fall Of ZZZ” video next year. The inevitable Hoyo cycle won’t be beaten!
"I need more games that are skill and strat based not numbers and percentages. Gacha games are literally just glorified gambling, i regret the twenty dollars i spent on hsr because i coulda bought something better with that money, like food lmao"
"It's a simple tell really
Pushback this sort of BS so that current and future gacha games don't get reeled into doing the same predatory idea

As much as the dumb part of the community that thinks Hoyo started everything yeah
Hoyo ""Innovated"" the 50/50 BS
Hoyo ""Innovated"" Global Passives
Imagine them introducing a char so powerful that because of ""lore"" he could break the 4th wall and for shats and giggles Hoyo decides to add a feature into their kit that they could give you a Skip Button. But the char is paywalled, imagine that.
Also with all the ""Lore"" crap they give Castorice, she's death right? So lore accurate we shouldn't be needing a revive anyways right, we can just slap her in and since ""Lore"" and all she can just kill everything right? Why do we need a revive if she could just kill everything?
Hell I think even a 1~3% chance of instant kill on anything sounds better than a global revive


IF by chance an upcoming game implements this paywalled Global Passive, the Gacha Gaming community will only look at 1 game that started all this BS. 

It's just a matter of time before they dip their fingers on ZZZ"
Only dumb people still religiously give hoyo their money
"Just like you said ""It's about what's come next"". I'm glad that I quit HSR early just like when I did with Genshin before everything turn to shit XD"
"The only thing you can do to punish a gacha company is quit the game. If you can't quit, it's you who have a problem and you are the reason they can get away with bs like that."
"Gacha itself is already a really bad ganre , I don't really care.
I see what I like, I pull.
I see what I don't like, I don't pull.
I like Cas, I pull."
ZZZ player. This is your game future. Its an inescapable fact that all hoyo games gonna be p2w
If this makes people quit the game that's great
bgm name pls?
It did quite the opposite
"​ @CultureAdd1ct No, it quite did kill the game since only whales could even get her. Many rolled failed and quit. Game only really has whales left like Hoyo wanted."
 @Dark.Solaris And by many you mean the few hundred people you saw on reddit and twitter? Cause that’s definitely an accurate representation of 10s of millions of people.
"@ Jeez dude, why so pessimistic? If you wanna play just play. Why do peoples opinions even matter to you?"
​ @Dark.Solaris That's an awful lot of projection you got there. You're a pessimistic downer trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.
" @Dark.Solaris  wuwa has FRACTIONS of the playerbase hsr has wdy,"
​@Dark.Solaris not true I spent no money and pulled her
I spend 5 to 20$ occasionally  for the pass or month summon currency subscription
and that's maybe every 3 or 4 months on the pass
or 3 times a year
​ @Dark.Solaris and probably they will use that money to improve ZZZ more and then player switch to ZZZ and they will make new game and repeat the process just like in genshin.
​ @Dark.Solaris i got her;-;
 @KerryFoxxo  that's the hoyo way
 @Fallen_Oasis  and what did it you cost you?
There is already leaks of 5 characters with global passives tho
 @vani3081  it’s not confirmed tho. You can’t just go off by leaks sometimes.
 @Fallensnowch  yeah we all wanted global passives to not go live and here we are
"Your reasoning about how the passive isn't even useful on teams with sustains like Aventurine is so out of place, the point of the argument is that she revives teammates wether or not she's in the team and that is game breaking enough lorewise or not."
" @tamaki_akira5  it’s not gamebreaking lol, with proper sustain and healers, you often won’t even need to trigger the global passive. The reason why people are mad, isn’t because Castorice’s passive is broken but is instead mad because of the probability that there will be more future global passives that grants things like Crit damage or Speed stats."
 @Fallensnowch  am kinda fine with only castorice only having that passive as long as shes the first and last to have global passive
Doomposters
Thats a good take. I say as long as you’re f2p pull for what you like as even if they know you pulled? They won’t make it much of a factor since you’re not spending money
@Richkero1993  I'm f2p
The start of the downfall of hsr😢
"Of course people would fall for it. Hoyo put that passive on a character that's fan favorite, broken as hell, with a tragic story, with visuals and attack animations we've never seen before in this game. It was the perfect plan to implement global passives."
I Seriously Hope This Game Dies.
"If the theory about Amphoreus is already destroyed and it's just a simulation thing true, then Castorice is a Walking Corpse that can Revive People..."
"just got Castorice, I'll get her LC next.

I'll pull who's i like, play however i want, and stop playing when it stop being fun.

no one opinion matters."
"Everyone complained about powercreep, and then they got account buffs by way of global passives. 
Be careful what you wish for with hoyo"
Mr Pooks' stupid tantrum completely veered the train off course
"To think Hoyo used to be miHoYo with the line ""Tech Otakus Save the World"" and it's bloody ironic that it's Kuro Games who got that mantle or in other word, they already had it in them."
Next year : the death of ZZZ.
meh still playing anyway
"As someone who considered this to be my favourite game at some piont, the moment I saw Castorice's kit leaks I uninstalled the game,, I am so done playing a game where the developers don't give a dime about it's players and just wants money."
"Crazy thing is, I pulled her and now regret it, I could have improved my top 9% Acheron if I got JQ"
"Open the game and get greet with a 2nd anniversary predatory cash grab, I kid you not they are literally put the banner in your face and get you to the whale events."
Man I’m so sad. I still remember when the game came out. Was so excited. I also whaled a bit. But now?.. Man Idk. I quit the game and went to WuWa. They at least care about their players.
"I uninstalled after the maintenance went up for 3.2. I don’t which to be privy to watching the game degrade further…
I stuck around for way too long to see if the game would get better, no more…"
Is today the Anniversary patch? Why's the community so dry?
Nah it’s the same they did with the universal stat sticks weapons in HI3 so ye it’ll keep going till people can’t afford the “content”
I think the game is in a fine state though. They're heading in the right direction. Hoyo fans are getting exactly what they deserve. Pretty entertaining watching the community in shambles trying to defend their multi billion dollar company and their consumer friendly practices
IT DOESN'T MATTER - pokke probably 😂
Dumpster 🔥 Rail o7
well do you suggest that ppl should not pull for her even if they don't care about gp and just want to have her for her fun gameplay ?
"Bruh when I opened the game after updating, they made a special ""Intro"" for her so you could directly go pull for her. Insane"
"And on top of all that, they direct you straight to rolling on her banner like one of those scummy gachas which is distasteful imho."
"​ @vergil9023 no? Because personally, I didn't like how she was attempted to be shoved down the throat. I don't like when a character is marketed in that manner."
More like Corporate Greed Ruin the World as miHoYo.
Now theyre just hypocrites
only WuWa survive!
Only if ZZZ devs should go independent from Hoyo because Hoyo's greed are out of control.
"Nah, next year is gonna be the death of Genshin and Star Rail. And year after that, and again, etc.

CCs need to earn their money farming fake drama."
Please don't speak this into existence 😢
"And in reality, none of them are dead"
"Idk man, ZZZ still standing even after that yao incident. Also just a cool game imo, Might wanna re-install it."
"Content creators farm drama about death of Genshin/HSR, but as of the most recent revenue statistics both games are making about 2-3X ZZZ's revenue"
"Hope not, I REALLY like the game"
Yeah! I hate it...a deliberate act of begging by hoyo
How do i say this.....the event is spending event and the new stuff they add is for whales only. So 30 pull + Ruan Mei/Luocha i guess? Nothing BIG like funny stuff or something....
@hendracs8264  yeah I saw the patch there's like 2 anniversary events and that's it. The only thing worth noting is Castorice with her GP issue and spending event. I even saw some players who show their disdain about the spending event and got bullied out by the community for being poor lmao.
"let's be real.
the braindead hoyoshill will not let castorice fail.
we live in this shitty timeline for a reason and that reason is because most people are too dumb to realize they're doing against their own good both for long term and short term, on so many things on life.

see you in a few years when IP cash grab gacha going to follow this shitty practice (global passive locked by paywall) and then after a few more years, 'newer' gacha players think that it is ""normal"".
similar situation can be observed on 'older' gacha player with their signature; 'BaCK IN mY TimE, There's NO PITY in GacHA'  yada yada coping"
Bro they can’t even give 10 free pulls in mail they are giving events to get that 10 pulls 🤡😐 even tho its there 2nd anniversary
I will come back to this video after hsr absolutely dominates the sales and makes 100 million+ in 3.2
you told me that no need to make video about this lol (beating the dead horse). Still glad you eventually make it anyway...
"The beast has been released, and I'm here for it"
Tectone Staff of Homa all over again
"""Honey, Glaivekiyo posted a new video. Time to wake up""




WOKEGE"
I need to stop watching ccs it's just drama and telling you what to think
"4:10
Double down and give it to the next game."
where are the 2d animations in the background from. Are they in game cut scenes
"ARISE ❌ 
ARICE ✅ 



I THINK HOYO SHOULD CREATE A NECROMANCER 5S CHARACTER 😂"
"I already give up on Hoyoverse …. Stop spending to their game and uninstall when others game like ananta/ark knigt enfield release 

Now i just support whatever TF hoyo pay2win practice …. 

So they can milk their players more"
"Most Hoyo CC's deep inside fck this game it's starting to become more predatroy trash

Hoyo CC's sees their monthly bills. Well I love trash, trash pays my bills, so they'll drag their community into loving trash along with them lmao"
"Only reason some, including myself and some of my friends, are still playing hsr is bcz of the fate collab. After we get EMIYA, Artoria or Berserker? We uninstalling the game. Shi got boring after like, 2.3?"
"It was not the global passives 
It was that the passive came before the old characters buff
The passive came before the skip button
The passive came before the story improvement 
The passive came before hp inflation fix
The passive came with spending events they don't give a f^¢k they simply want the money from the players they don't want to make the game good they want to milk money from the players."
"Leave the game to the fools who are fine being taken advantaged of. Years or months later, when their precious game becomes unplayable, let it be known that when the signs were there they ignored it. Then remind them they have no right to complain, rather than try to save their game, they chose to sit back and watch it die."
"I was having so much fun in the siege alter event (arknights) and i was NEVER expected for this to be the main talk of twt

used to play hsr like a while, and got bored, and probably won't now"
"Imo, their down fall started with changing their company name from mihoyo to hoyoverse(this name sucks, fight me)

The first game from them that I played is Honkai Impact 3rd, Im a year 1 player has just recently quit at the new year Kiana patch(seriously I should quit it when part 2 hit). The game has insane powercreep problem but 2 f2p/light spender(monthly) player can still manage endgame well: abyss at Agony3-RL without much issue(I sometime got to Nirvana and manage to stay there for 2 weeks). Everything changed when part 2 hits tho, the game become something that I and a lot of year 1 player just cant recognize that THIS is Honkai 3rd. The story is extremely boring at the first patch(you know well how shit their writting is), after that? I dont know, I dont trust the people who managed to make me fall asleep while trying to read the story they cooked up that the story will get good after whatever i read through at first. The powercreep is what sealed the deal tho, you need to pull for every new characters since EVERY single one of them is meta, they are both dps and support at the same time and they are stupidly strong too thus HP bloated(for comparison: an SSS boss at MA in part 1.5 is around 14 millions hp, a newest(at least when i quit) SSS boss is like 68 millions hp. This jump is in just one year)
Oh they lower the pity for character banner and the weapon banner are guarante how amazin- as if, now you have to pull for every character and their sig every patch becuz of team building(dude this one is insane, I wont explain it here since it stupidly long and somewhat complicated), a f2p player can get like 15k xtals per patch and you need 42k to guaranteed a patch so F you Mihoyo

Genshin? Quit long ago, the first time I quit it is before the 1st anniversary but has already played for 8 months or so, too boring and took to much time to do anything. I returned to the game before Raiden Shogun came out, played to the end of Kokomi banner? Then i quit the game for good

HSR? Yo this one is insane, the hype I have for this game I nuts. At the time where I still love Honkai 3rd. This came out, I have always love strategy game you see and this is an extension of Honkai 3rd lore? Sign me in. After it came out and played it? my disappointment cant be describe by word, the game turn-based system is fine but like Mihoyo games, it has hp bloated problem and shit. The story? Oh boii, aside from Welt that originally came from Honkai 3rd, there is NO Honkai what so ever in the story so why even put Honkai in the name of the game anymore and the writting is shit like always so after 6 months i quit the game

I never even touched ZZZ so dont have anything to say aside that this game will follow the path that lead to downfall just like every other games of their

The lesson I learned is that to never touch their game again and Im glad that I quit all of them."
"I'll say it again
you finished puzzles, riddles, easter egg and what you get? YES Rewards Chest
but rewards is ridiculous,
purple and blue tier relics???? wtf is that for. no one use those anymore in endgame
i still found it in amphoreus wtf"
"global passive in HSR are truly ruin the game like imagine you don't like spesific character cuz their kits are mostly trash or the design are not your cup of tea, but kinda forced to pull them cuz they have really good global passive and losing that will brick your account 💀 damn"
"true, if they improved their game no one would care"
"1- the buffs are coming. They announced it. 
2-Just read lil bro, no need for skip button.
3-story needs some improvement, yes. But it's already going good and decent despite the flaws
4-HP inflation needs huge revamp yes, but just git gud for the time being. 
5+6 - of course they want money they're a business company, not a charity. Yes there are flaws, they'll eventually fix them. But they're not THAT serious as you guys doompost. Just relax and enjoy the game lmao."
" @Pray2Herta  they announced the buffs ? Can u tell me what they are as u know they were announced in 3.0 and it's already 2 patches and all 
Yeah my fault for not being able to read a 8.5 hours of dogshit story that the devs admitted was bad 
Also my bad nikkador oneshots me should have used my crystal ball to foresee the future and pulled better
Also I have no issue paying for a good game but I have issue when devs are simply motivated by greed and not passion"
" @Manishrana854  
1-They already said they are gonna release them. Just wait. 
2- while I'm not saying the story is particularly top notch or flawless, i don't remember when did they admit it was bad
3- Nikador one shots your team? The passive got added so you can face him.
Use it wisely"
" @Pray2Herta  ok so I am finally be able to use my argenti and dhil
Also they said the story was bad in the radio when they talked about black screen white text 
Also I quit the game gg continue to have fun without me friends my journey was till here only"
"​ @Pray2Herta  ""just read lil bro, no need for skip button.""

Warcraft III, a 2 DECADE old RTS game which arguably contributed to WoW's development (subsequently any MMO for that matter) to it's absolute peak HAS A SKIP BUTTON. It is a very heavy story-centric game, same concept of key characters and NPCs interacting, yet still they provide that option.

HSR and Genshin have no excuse. Other than the skip button covering up what abysmal content they have or keeping ""player retention rates up""."
​ @Pray2Herta just git gud? Current MoC12 is way too hard for the wrong reasons. All this to promote THerta. I had to cheese the f out of it to beat it with my Acheron team
 @TypowyKubini  dude pretty sures a guy on yt beat it with only 4 stars all you gotta do is learn the boss mechanics
​ @Frogking5  Okay so PPL just assume everyone is a tryhard these days? Then why bother pulling meta if you can be Musashi and solo most of the content with trailblazer.
"​ @Pray2Herta  Don't try defending HSR, it's a losing battle and this is just my friendly advice. It's in a horrible place currently and that's facts, pure and simple."
"The problem is: if we don't do anything, this will happen in every other game. Then it will be the norm and gacha games will become unplayable without spending over 200 dollars on the next new character."
"@ I know, that’s the catch 22 here isn’t it. The possibility of other Gachas adopting that disgusting practice. The sad reality is that you can’t save people who don’t want to be saved. Logic, pattern recognition, sheer common sense doesn’t work. All we can do is wash our hands of these games, and let the fallout do its job.

Hoyo doesn’t understand that, that global passive is going to make it impossible for new players to come to the game. After Castorices banner passes, they will have effectively locked their game from receiving new blood.

This is a death sentence, and it’s started the clock on the end of HSR. With no new players, Hoyo is going to be left trying to cater to their current players. Sadly time takes everyone and more people will start dropping the game. Revenue will decrease, and because of the global passives basically locking the game, HSR will Die a slow and painful death.

The fact these Shills don’t understand this goes to show how limited their capacity to think is."
This will never happen. All of this only affects poor people.
"@Zanzecus  i think it will be the opposite actually. I think they will make a massive amount off of the banner and upcoming banners, but your right though. Their game won't be able to grow because of this, and word spreads around faster than one might think.

Overall, It's not just HSR anymore, it's HOYOverse as a whole that is going downhill."
"@kyromaniac7478  yeah, I just don't think that's true at all lmao."
 @CultureAdd1ct  what in particular?
Lil bro thinks he's in an edit 😭
 @Pray2Herta  huh
 @kyromaniac7478  i wasn't talking to you lil bro
@SolariusAureum  ok
Perhaps it's for the best that all gachas become unplayable so we all collectively just stop playing gachas completely.
 @JLawrencium  that would suck tbh
" @JLawrencium  messed up thing is I can't disagree. Gacha is just DLC you're gambling with. I even understand the fear these fans of Gacha are going through. For all intents and purposes, if the devs shut down the game, then the game can no longer be played. 

In Gacha, you don't own the game, you are renting space to play it, and if the devs suddenly want to end it, you can forget playing it again. Now maybe someone will make the game playable, but no more updates means what you get is the final product. 

It's bad, and it's essentially gamers not owning their games."
🔥
"Im going to pull for her for free and if i dont get her im simply uninstalling it. Ill just play Wuwa, TFD and NGS."
"I truly dont care, im having fun anyways"
"honestly, the CC's are the ones that can't pick a side..."
It just hurts because now I know how the community will act if ZZZ falls on its face with something extremely concerning. The exact same way they did with HSR. I'll cut my losses and play other great games that have nothing to do with Hoyoverse
"I’ve stop playing hsr cuz I don’t have the luxury of waiting 10-13mins talking dialog with no skip got me irritated so I quit the game ..the game is good the story idk they put to much nonsense yapping which we don’t rlly needed, it’s like You have to watch the whole story with no skip whatsoever…."
"Just let the game die , stop caring and stop spending. The only way for hoyo to listen is to stop spending money and not show  lnterest . It's just that simple. The sooner you expect that all the time you spent on the game was pointless and you play other games. The sooner you will not care about hoyo games anymore"
"Shit show, I lost, and there's only 30 fucking pulls, hsr is 2.3 from where I'm at, let's make it lower. This game doesn't deserve us. 

AND I AHVE TO WAIT 17 FUCKING DAYS, MAN THIS IS IS SO ASS WHO TF PLAYS THIS GAME ANYMOREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
"No, la verdad no."
If the CN guys is okay with it then its all good.
"Man what happened with HSR between 2.0 and 3.2

And people are saying that ZZZ can't be ruined like this, yeah sure 😂"
Goal : 99 million HSR revenue by end of April 2025
"Nah hoyo wont die, look at genshin now. Just play the game thats is fun."
"i bet if wuwa did smt like this nothing would happen cus ""its not that bad you're just mad cause wuwa ended genshin"" meanwhile I left the genshin community a long time ago and honestly I learned from my mistake when I said acheron would be bad for the game, the game hasn't changed that much at all and this global passives for other chars what if what if is all from unreliable sources and most importantly hyacine a character rumored to have a global passive has been leaked and doesn't have one. maybe next anniversary something like this will happen again because meta slaves never learn"
"I bet castorice banner will be hsr's most successful banner, or atleast top3"
"Box2: ""I admit I am hypocrite for pulling Castorice even though I said I dislike the idea of global passive"" (+respect)

Pokke: ""He’s taken it upon himself to hold back other ccs that want to talk shit and start drama with me, causing him a lot of shit in the background, and nothing of which I’m aware of. While I’m thankful he’s trying to divert these ccs from coming at me, I don’t see why it matters to any of us since we both know all these CCs are irrelevant. Their existence is meaningless to me, let them chase their latest drama slop with my name. None of them will come close to the influence that I’ve shared with tec since before I even quit my full time job. If they want to farm some views because they need it, I’m all for it. Heck they are already farming this as we speak because tec stopped holding them back. Yes this is referring to people like saintontas, no I don’t give a fuck about bro even if he made 100 vids about me, hope he’s happy with the ad rev, I will never engage.

There has been a lot of collateral damage on both parts, and I’m glad that he acknowledged his actions have inadvertently caused me issues, as do I. The c6 arle is a poor example and I apologise, I should’ve used c6 cantarella instead even though the point is exactly the same; no one should be morally held for pulling a gacha unit. You aren’t a hypocrite, you are a player.

He believes in pro consumerism and the customer is always right, but I don’t. He caters to anti hoyo, I cater to people that happens to play hoyo games in this case HSR, it’s just the way it is. While I can see the differences in ideology doesn’t make him my enemy, most people on the internet won’t see that, especially people that have their own agendas to push, viewers and CCs alike. Compared to being called a rapist or pedophile, being called a hypocrite pales in comparison, but it doesn’t make it any less bad because those are his views of me, and I would never have those views of him. I still hold my ground against the people that have these moral compasses in a gacha game, but it’s unfortunate that it’s against tec as well.

I mean this on my soul, when I was rewatching the clips off stream during my time at Austin and SDO with tec, like meeting the first time, going to gym, hugging for the zzz relic roll, I got emotional. Not because we can’t talk about each other anymore in order to appease both our communities and the ideological differences, not because tec was one of my first and closest cc friend and I vibed w him hard, but it’s because I know something like this will never happen again. The next time, if it ever happens, his chat or my chat is probably gonna go kms ew dookie or kms ew dicktone. As much as I’d love to hang out again, we will never see the vibes being recreated unless our communities make a 180 change.

There won’t be a gacha war, at least not between myself and tec. It’s just a sad conclusion to a story, one that no one could’ve prevented as ourselves and our communities both stand for different things. The best part? Instigators and drama ccs looking to farm this will spin the narrative into some even bigger bullshit to push their agendas and go ultra farm mode. 

I know we won’t interact on content anymore, but this isn’t content, this is the end of an era from my POV. Tec you were never my enemy, I never hated you as a person and never will, and I would’ve moved to Austin for a few months after I settled my house, but this is the best ending for everyone in the space because most people online aren’t mature, and cc farmers want to farm."""
"While Mihoyo has becoles far more confident in their predatory practices, they still make some of the most beautiful, handsome and cutest characters, which is the only reason I play their for, still."
once a hoyo game always a hoyo game
Saintontas should react to this then his comment section will once again ask for the oiled up Changli cosplay
Yeah this hurts. Taking a break of the game. May quit fully because we hate all of this honestly. This was our first gacha game and hate to see go down this path.
"Thing is, if they had introduced global passives much earlier and instead of 1 character having a passive, everybody would, things would be okay. For the most part.

I just woke up so the sentencing possibly looks weird."
Don’t put every cc under the same box. They are all individuals who main goals are vastly different from the others
"If ZZZ was pay to play game, that will be no gacha system at all."
"How about trying a different genre of game? I could recommend.....Sleeping Dogs or Watch Dogs 1, 2. I never played either of them but I've been hearing that they are great games that age like fine wine."
@ I definitely need to play sleeping dogs and watch dogs 2. I remember playing a bit of watch dogs 2 some years ago. I should finish it up
" @ilikebeans9380 both are also AAA games that you only need to pay once (outside of possible DLCs), so you can say they have better value than gachas (or any other live service games for that matter)"
And put with a lot of negative reviews to increase Hoyogreed's pressure.
Probably ain't gonna happen Considering Amount of Whales and Hoyoshills this game has
" @goodstuff07  Not just a whale, Poseidon. I saw someone pulls for 100 limited LC for no reason 2 time."
 @FlariousNut  Whatever you say Friend
"I bet /if wuwa/ yeah hypothetical. You're so cooked trying to justify the blatant disregard hoyo has for it's playerbase in a whole that you'd come up with imaginary scenarios just to support your delusional beliefs. Wuwa ended genshin? When lol? Wuwa is just doing better than before due to improvements, that's it. Genshin or any other hoyoverse games won't die cause they have players like you to milk from"
"acheron didnt change the game much? brother they gave her universal break on her ult and it immediately led to firefly, boothill, and now anaxa rendering the elemental system useless for dpses LOL not even mentioning how it warped the power level of dpses going forward. this is an insane level of delusion"
 @lsmsm9  bro she was worse than jingliu by far for a couple patches until jiaoqiu came out..
@ im f2p they make no money off me so like..
" @ARIV4RSAL ”I bet if wuwa” Yes they would actually. Whimpering waste have been criticised to death, People complained about character kits and there are alot of criticism vids if you go searching for it"
Based kirby
It's been a problem since their HI3rd days lmao.
"Well, HexJuice is retiring (I think), so someone has to oil up."
"You know those predatory turn-based cheap cash grabs that boost power level for every character and copy you pull for? Yeah, that's the kind of future players fear of due to her passive."
"Is not only the powercreep it self is also taking you the freedom of choice, why I would pull for a character that doesnt have a global passive?"
Why do you sound femboyish n this one kiyo?
"Its not the fall of anything except the herd mentality of hoyo haters in general. The game is just fine. You guys just don't like the game and that's fine but the game is nowhere near the worst thing in gacha. All this dumb drama did is get all the weird gacha tourist to leave and cause trouble in another gacha inevitably when they remind you that gacha in general are all predatory and scummy. I mean you guys are rly defending another anime casino and playing morality over another gacha is low on the self awareness scale. Just play the game you like and if you don't then move on. Its a vidya game, not real world politics. No need to be all liberal about this. This whole thing is so dumb because you guys think you have any real power or for some reason think CCs and their audiences represent the entire playerbase when most ppl don't give any actual shit about the passive because the only ppl that care are those that are sweaty in the game who are either alrdy satisfied with endgame as they are still able to clear it just fine or find enjoyment in other subjective things in the game besides endgame. Like the devs themselves have the data and know way more than all of you. Most of you CCs aren't even sweaty in the game yourselves let alone play it but somehow care this much about the 1% of the playerbase? The game is insanely casual so I'm extremely curious to why ppl are this butthurt but you can trust the EN side to find reason to not only dislike something but create outrage over the most trivial of things. Like I'm shocked ppl have played games like fgo, gbf, or any gacha pre genshin times and think this is the worst thing ever. Im shocked ppl can look at previous hoyo games with global passives like hi3 that have been alive for over 7 years with global passives and thing otherwise. You guys are weird and playing right into this artificial outrage CCs unnecessarily create for content."
"dont forget there is an incoming spending event to turbosink this game into full p2w, just like its predecessor. truly a genshin could never moment"

"You guys need to understand, HoYo really needs this money."
Hoyo started to filter HSR players. Once they filtered everyone who disagree like in Genshin they will have another loyal army. They aim to trap those whales who spent thousand dollars lmao
"I dont know the law and stuff, but they can't remove/change her global passive anymore because that would be a ""nerf"" since shes already released. So if they want to appease the players, they should stop releasing characters with global passive."
"Lets wait until next Gacha Revenue, I think a lot of people are gonna be pissed.
Idk if they are gonna be HSR fans or Haters but they're gonna be pissed 😂"
"Guys where is the push back against hovo this is not good it's The time to show them global passives as a game design is bad 
But now 1 month later everyone just joking about it 
Help save the game"
"Lets be honest,the hoyoshills are gonna eat this up either way like its a 5 star dish(a dish with undercooked part)"
"People think HSR will die but nah, it won't."
HSR IS DEADDDDD HHAHAAHHAHAHA
"miHoYo listening to Global player? pfff hahaha XD

wait you serious? HAHAHAHAHA ok let me tell one thing about miHoYo ...they look at us the Global player as second class citizen they say we listen but don't give crap about you Global player
and those HSR content creator they say big words like i quit miHoYo game or i uninstall because this thing next day the make another video play the game they quit / uninstall 
HSR content creator are a joke they word that come out from there mouth mean jack shit"
I used to love hoyoverse games cuz of the quality they bring and their Generousity when i was still playing HI3rd. But after some point HI3 has started to ramp up their predatory and so i switch to main genshin and genshin kept being such a petty game. That time HSR got released so i jumped to HSR at first they were generous and people were praising this one CEO(i forgot his name) for being the generous dev that handle HSR but now... I don't even feel like playing hoyoverse games anymore it's like falling into the same loop all over again with no end.
Day one player.... the first warning signs were after Blade and how anti climactic the story was and DHIL... I quit at that very moment.
Oh no..if you think castorice passive is bad ..wait there is 4-5 coming down the line😊
How did hsr die faster than genshin. 😭
"HSR releases a makes Genshin looks like a subpar product 

ZZZ Season 2 releases and makes HSR look like a subpar product 

???? releases and makes ZZZ looks like a subpar product"
Biggest truth in this comment section by far.
"As a Genshin and HSR player, for me Genshin is mostly stagnant. They dont change. Same style, same releases. 
They bring new mechanics for new region. But they are temporary like fontain mechanics which are already useless now.
While in HSR there is elements, team, type of attack, and many more each was getting powercrept after 2 months.
As a day 1 player, by 2.2 i realise something fishy with HSR and uninstalled it.
If Genshin follows same formula like global passives, paid events etc. Yep ill quit that too. 
The most predatory practice they did till now was muavika and citlali banner at same time and the free pulls in 2nd half. I didnt like it."
"​ @mtn6315 
Genshin is basically stagnant GARBAGE that never changes itself in a meaningful way."
"Dude, legit their are hsr players that already spreading the word filter the player base thanks to the Global passive. And i shit you not, they even wanted more Global passives in the future coz they believe it will surely filter more players and the only people who are going to remain are the ones that truly likes hsr. 
These people literally screaming ""DA WEI MILK ME MORE!!"" . Like holy shit"
" @mtn6315  i agree w the citlali banner thing, that was awful"
​@mtn6315 but we do have a global passive if you remember but that's for mora
" @mtn6315  
One of the most PREDATORY GARBAGE that Genshin had released, a double banner with Mavuika and Citlali, with free pulls being AFTER their banners. Genshjn has NO hope."
Good expmle that honkai3rd bunny event for en look how they fvck up en player
Genshin didn't have THIS level of Powercreep 😂
@jaredjosephsongheng372  fair enough
"At this point, we can probably assume Hoyo wants the community to keep fighting on purpose. They want the drama to keep going and help them stay relevant to the market."
The downfall of HSR's player reception has got to be studied
Waiting for a comprehensive takedown of the new atsu o7
"Older units become unusable in hsr, they really forced me to pulls character that I don't like to clear end game content. glad I quit that game"
Did it fall to 2.8 stars last time? Its 4.0 stars when I checked today.
"i've been a huge fan of hsr since the very first beta tests--accepted as one of the galaxy testers and was there for every single beta test. i was a day 1 player since the game came out, logging in just hours after the launch. i have many, many battle passes and monthlies paid for. logged in every single day for almost 2 years straight. didn't miss a single day. i have almost every limited character + sig lc in the game and i seriously loved the game.
ever since the castorice beta was being leaked... i have not pressed the launch button in weeks. they crossed a line that i refuse to follow. really sucks since i really liked her design & personality, too."
"Can't wait for ZZZ Season 2 Powercreep level☠️, remember this my prediction is inevitable."
"Player : you suppose be chosen one to destroy hoyoverse. Not join them
Cc : that not my problem"
was about to download hsr before this vid😭😭
"Nah to me its the stupid story bloat, black screens and stupid same character model after 2 years. Its damn boring."
"​ @Glaivekiyo   hoyo aswhole is in big trouble on multiple raining of problems for them

second they fire mass of their own employees

Besides  Gachasmack 
third  EN VA'S are Rampaging 
on hoyo 
and Cn players are combining With EN players to  Rampage on hoyo devs. 
fourth  Netease is about to sue them plagrisim becuz of copying their music from other game  and use it on natlan"
Whales spend in a game that's popular
coz hoyo could never..that there goal this 2025 and going forward
"Man... it used to be such a nice and comfy game.

PS: I still can't forgive them for not letting me hug Firefly, though."
Does all wuwa cc have nothing to do at all?

Даже графику и мини игры убили...
Про то что они перекрасили волосы Барбаре и продают ее снова.... Я за ре юз и прочие ухищрения, но одно дело собрать мост из забора в poe, и другое михуё....."
"Yea, global passive is like having a Arcanine on your pokemon storage which constantly intimidates every opponent you encounter or Gyarados with its pressure. It doesn't seem unfair, now imagine you got all those debuff pokemon on your storage and suddenly every opponent is weakened by a whole lot. HSR might not be PvP but it tells a lot on how the end game enemies will be adjusted to make you pull for characters with their global passive."
"Btw where r u from. If u r from US, this is just another rasic video."
make castorice shirtless = problem solved :body-blue-raised-arms::body-blue-raised-arms:
I think dawei may cry 6 is gonna release sooner than i though😂
It depends on the region. In Indonesia it's already on its way to 2.7.
In my region it’s rated 4.4 on App Store and 2.3 on playstore
"In Philippines, its 2.8 right now"
You must not forget that many positive reviews in the PlayStore are Botted and MHY has a History to use bots
"Hehe, come to wuwa... 
We have pineapple pizza and walking bath tub.
😂😂"
 @DazBiB Wuwa have been more mystical in the recent patches. When will we be back to black shores I have no clue.
"Wow, that's cool. 

Are you aware that nobody gives a S-?"
"​ @Richkero1993  that's the charm of Kuro games... they drop the most goated story when u didn't know they will😂😂😂

(I talk from experience with pgr😂😂😂)"
It's just a matter of time before this prediction becomes true.
 @zephyrabysstrinity  at least they are addressing the issues of old characters getting buffed... but yeah.
"​ @Syahburei 
They should have made global passive being available for f2p. In any game powercreep is inevitable but they could atleast made it f2p friendly."
It might be a trick after the update 2.0
Lmao your wrong they are already addressing powercreep and saying they will rework old characters to make them work well with new content
"​@Jithu_Chilukuri
Finally my gallaghar will be relevant."
​ @zephyrabysstrinity  ah i am talking about ZZZ idk about hsr 😂😂
ZZZ dev team dropped yesterday Dev Talk video about buffing old characters and ensuring they become more future proof and they wont be just simply changing numbers
"​@Jithu_Chilukuri
Well if they're buffing zzz characters, its still a win for me since it'll give me reason to again play it, my hands were already full by playing genshin hsr and wuwa, really hoping they don't follow their predecessors."
"And they're right, it isn't."
You think the players care? A few thousand people is nothing compared to the tens of millions of active lovers of the game.
@SatireEnjoyer1  like what tect say. When time come and not favorable. Don't complain. There alot players been trap after playing for so long and can't stop playing.  There are ppl love game just don't want support it due some reason. You can't category those stop playing as they don't have love for the game.
@SatireEnjoyer1 the sales are already threw the roof. The CCs grandstanding did nothing lmao
"They're a former HSR & Genshin Impact player, ofc they're gonna talk about it, y'all always say this just to be dismissive to ignore those criticisms or feedbacks that are actually reasonable. People like you always defend a multi billionaire acting like that company is a damn child"
Yes making videos dumbass
​ @Cheetogirboyver  well i play for fun until all the fun gone when i try to defend my favourite game people just calling me hoyod*g or hoyoclown
" @ZER0V5i  Probably because you're defending a multi billionaire company that is ignoring their players  feedbacks and criticism, you can't expect that everyone will agree with you and when the devs are being manipulative. This game committed colorism and mocking cultures, as much I love to play Genshin Impact this game CANNOT & WILL NEVER ESCAPE CRITICISM, it's really not hard to accept it, this game itself asks for players feedback and when the players did a feedback y'all get pissed off. People like you expect everything to be positive about this company and the game itself has no flaws, people call you a hoyodog or a Hoyoclown because you're defending their wrong actions and that's valid for people to complain"
"​ @Cheetogirboyver  i didn't mad until i look at the comments they said Star rail is a sh*t game that when i can't hold my anger they literally call every hoyoverse game is a sh*t game without even playing it, go blame hoyoverse not my favourite game go ask da wei why he never listen to community, no matter what they said i never say anything bad about wuthering waves because i also playing it and it good i said it good not because of the community i said the game bad"
"​ @ZER0V5i  da Wei never listen because he doesn't have to, whatever happen people keep funding the game"
"@ZER0V5i  I understand that you're angryz but you could literally just block and ignore them, if you play the game for fun, people who say that hoyoverse games are shit are probably used to be one of their game's player, also you said ""ask Dawei why he never listens to the community"" ofc he never listens ever since they got popular, you don't even realize that comment is being dismissive itself, players have been asking artifact load outs, what did they do? NOTHING, free 5 star that is actually good? NOTHING, in this current update all they do is add some basic and bare minimum things to add in a game. It took many updates for Hoyoverse to finally add another slot for the expeditions. A type of person like you has that ""if we continue being positive we might get what we want🤓"" although this is a good idea but ALL YOU GOT IS SCRAPS THAT ARE BARE MINIMUM TO ADD. All I gotta say is that WAKE THE FUCK UP HOYOVERSE IS NOT A SMALL COMPANY ANYMORE THEY'RE MULTI-BILLIONAIRE YOU'RE NOT IN 2020 ANYMORE WAKE THE FUCK UP, THIS GAME DOESN'T RESPECT PLAYERS TIME A SIMPLE SKIP BUTTON CAN'T BE EVEN ADDED WHEN THIS GAME ALMOST HALF A DECADE OLD. You do realize why wuwa players talk shit about Genshin Impact because they used to be a former player of Genshin Impact most the things they said about Genshin is true, the devs never listen after many years of begging and asking, bloated dialogues that you can't skip because the devs are really FORCING you to listen to the story. Even myself a genshin player asks directly Dawei HE WILL NOT CARE BECAUSE ALL HE WANTS IS MONEY, HE CAN CRY ALL HE WANTS THAT PLAYERS ARE CRITIZING HIM I'LL NEVER BOW DOWN TO A FUCKING MANIPULATIVE BILLIONAIRE. Those players are human beings if the devs never listen to them for almost half a decade they'll feel unheard and lose hope for them that's just how it works. A player like you has toxic positivity, you guys are scared of criticism and acting in this game can't have flaws once it's called out you guys go crazy"
"Da wei wont listen because players like you will gracefully and PoSitIveLY eat whatever slop they feed you​, and fyi I've played both games you mentioned just in case you try to use that argument @ZER0V5i "
"​ @ZER0V5i  they ain't wrong when they say that hoyo games suck, they are only good until you start comparing them with other games"
​ @saivupu  really all hoyo game suck give a reason
"The plot and lore one and the minigame part is so real... because you can stop playing endgame content and still enjoy the game, kind of, if the lore is good and the events are fun... but the story is so bad that it got me thinking if they fired all of their writers and are creating plots with AI... because neither is genshin, nor even HI3d doing good story wise either. And the events are so meh..."
"@ Yep, i think its really possible"
"Essentially it would be like how Guardian tales or even cookie run kingdom ended up being due to all the `account wide` bonuses that newer players would have to struggle to get thru to hope to catch up with the end game, since most of them even with plenty of changes would require months or even an entire year of playing just to barely catch up at all...

This is why i absolutely abhorred gacha games that either replace units too fast or makes it extremely a pain in the arse to acquire units by either preparing them can take over an entire patch to just work on a single unit or they give effectively no breathing room if you have to play the rerun chasing game or something...

Aka moral of the story: P:GR having gacha pity rates far lower then the `competition` and let you even acquire alot of additional goods thru alternative non-gacha means makes even newer players able to catch up with alot more ease then something like honkai impact 3rd`s crap."
"Wth is a rasic, are you talking about an organization?"
"​ @Cheetogirboyver 
I think he was saying Basic video.
Because well this is literally 99% of Gacha Game CC's content nowadays."
6??? isn't it 2??
" @kenkaneki8396  o yeah i forget , i always imagine him crying in every hoyo disaster news😂"
​ @danzfranz  I think he does but not on camera anymore otherwise shareholders will treat him like 50/50 lose
 @gtx21  🤣🤣 bahahaha 👍
"Hoyo went ahead with the global passive because they 100% know their CCs and community would fold like paper and are just spineless people. If Kuro would did this, they would get mass review bombed, their CCs would riot, the change would then be reverted and then they would give out 400 Astrites as compensation with an accompanying apology tweet. Kuro knows that power is on its players, Hoyo knows its players are slaves trapped in sunk cost fallacy"
People really thought hsr is a good game? Especially when it's made by hoyo? After a month or two i knew it's a shit game.
i dont think it will be the fall of HSR yet but it starting to go there.i bet when the banner come people will drop big bucks for it none of these drama will matter unfortunately
"We were tricked into Belebog, and afterwards it was hoping that the story and game would improve beyond that moment of Wildfire."
Being a koro games enjoyer is like the rich laughing at the homeless (hoyoverse games) in situations like these.
I never played HSR but all this drama is entertaining to me
What's more of it...TB is like a weakling MC
"What a soundtrack my friend, I started to play star rail for the story in 2.6 (because of Robin), but I didn't like what hoyoverse was doing with the game, so I got Robin and stopped playing, maybe I would come back to the game after they release all 3.X story ( I hope that I don't have to spend more than 50 hours seeing black screens...)"
"Welp, this is why I play for fun I guess. I never had a side to choose to begin with regardless of any drama...it's all just been me. And, well...from a black teenage kid that has exaggerated swagger once said: ""Nah, Imma Do My Own Thing!"" So I will. 🗿"
They fell of the day they decided to fumble my glorious queen jingliu
Castorice Global passive can't revive this patch even worse the game itself
Live stream when??
imagine if hsr release a character that has global passive of disabling all global passive of all character that has one and it was given for free. 🤣
"""Fall of a game and the rise of another ratsu"" their words, not mine, idrc"
I saw hsr review bomb its at 2.5 stars at playstore
Il say it again. I will never understand how people believed in this game after Genshin impacts blatant mistreatment. Honkai star rail players really thought they were better than Genshin players and now they are at a worse low then them lmao😂
I wouldnt say the death of honkai yet it really depends on the next future unit and future unit when amphoreus is done
"wow,giving normies gacha really ruined their brains"
Dead coffin game let's go
Akivili is very disappointed now .
well said
There's a good reason why the Hoyoverse fans are hated everywhere
"​ @adriantepes4355 
Well I'd rather them not get hated then.
Who cares if they're spineless, they're the ones losing money in the first place 😂
Why do you care when someone else loses their money?"
"In a nutshell: hoyo-verse has a fk-ton of marketing in place so they can make fantastic use of `losing alot of money & presence in the gacha landscape` to force CCs to not immediately just drop out, but they just kept pushing it without a care in the world even when popular CCs started to leave.

Which since they got a massive pile of games now they could probably give less then a entire fk if one of them collapses if they can just use that drama to promote another game and just continue the cycle to corpse circulate it and likely make far more money in one game to keep the other ones afloat with ease that even if all thar games are garbage, as long as one of them is wildly successful, they can keep the others running to just musicial chair which one to make the most popular and the others to just be fodder to promote ones other then themselves by being bad to make other ones look good.

Kuro-games actually understands regardless of what the stockholders demand, if they dont appease the playerbase, then they cant really make the money the stockholders would get back, if they constantly flip off the playerbase, much less keep the business running

Overall though, stockholders is just a supplement to help with the game`s development, not the mandatory driving factor on the game itself.

Also why when i finally had to replace my honda accord 2006~ finally after having it for nearly 12~15ish years, i decided to pay in full for my next car immediately to not have to deal with any taxes or `liabilities` known as interest.

Because thats what stockholders and catering to the market, instead of the consumers always does, the one who actually consume the media, are the ones that should be your priority, not the ones just using said media as some money laundering `get rich with ease scheme` by just humping a popular product and get more money outta it as it gets popular and the stockholder gets more greedier in the process."
" @jaredjosephsongheng372  nonono u dont understand, hoyoshills get hated because how obnoxious they are. any arguments made for their fav game will never be accepted"
man u have mental problem about prejudice and illusion
 @BladeSerph  mental illness man. get a job
"You could say, Hoyo players are getting screwed by the ""fallacy of no return"""
" @kharismanando9051  
Ok? And so what about that.
If they want to be st(u)pid and just keep spending then just let them do so.
Eventually they'll realize their st(u)pidity, but nope, you guys keep attacking them giving them an incentive to keep playing, to get more unified."
" @jaredjosephsongheng372  Cause it sets a precident one Company pulls it off others will follow Kuro may NOT but others do and soon it's the entire industry look at microtransactions they were a way for F2P Games to earn money for future content and server upkeep now it's in every fullprice Game on the planet why cause people reacted like you just did who cares it's their money that's lost not mine.
Soon it will be yours if every Game ever has global passives and microtransactions and whatever other crap these greedy ass companies can come up with that nobody speaks up about cause it's not my problem it's someone else's haha oh shit nothing to play anymore cause every game is Star Rail now. :("
Fr they cant take any form of criticism ​@adriantepes4355
​ @jaredjosephsongheng372 once enjoyed gi but because of brainless community game never improved so it is necessary to keep roasting these shills and making sure they don't spill into other games
"​@Frankenstein_ Just like how MTX started with the infamous horse armor in Skyrim. Now, MTX has become the norm in video games"
" @jaredjosephsongheng372  No no theyre not hated because of that. Theyre hated because how ignorant and poisonous they are. Most of them never ever played any other game in their life before so their fandom is full of casuals dont know anything about games so they whine about fanservice even on games that isnt made by hoyo plaguing its content without even playing the game. Just check any character in any gacha game and you'll see bunch of clown hoyoshills that says ''umm thats x from insert hoyo game character copy'' why do you think wuwa players hate them so much ? you cant find a single character in wuwa where this clowns wont call a copy... They dont know how to be treated by their company so hoyo does the most scummy addition with minimal complaints, normalizes it and it poisons other gacha games moving forward. Thats why every single gaming fandom hates them.

tldr: Its the biggest, most ignorant, mosty whiny and most poisonous fandom"
"​ @jaredjosephsongheng372  because it encourage the developers to ruin their own game for that same money, which ruins our fun."
"Hoyo only listens to their chinese community. If the chinese community doesn't care, devs wouldn't care also. As for now, the global passive has no significant impact and Castorice overall design has far more popularity than the reception of her global passive. Revive is negligible for old players. To newbies, it's a quality of life."
" @Frankenstein_  
The industry is being fed by THE PLAYERS.
If everyone stops paying then the industry literally stops.
Its not like other live service games in which if they screw up, they can just refuse to fix their game and just take your money.
No, they NEED the players more than the players NEED them.
Just because it happened in the past doesn't mean it's happening now. Gacha games are not full price, they are free, with zero ads as well."
"⁠ @diluc-s7f The chinese community DOES care actually. Theres already tons of videos outside of mrpokke about the reception of the global passive.

Also calling a characters kit that you need to pull a “quality of life” is exacly what hoyo wants. If it were a qol they would’ve given it out for free.

And no its not the gp that castorice has thats the issue, Its the groundwork that has been laid for more powercreep. Especially with the company history of doing that."
"​​​​ @Richkero1993 As long as the global passive remains to be this one we have, i don't think it's enough to ensure enough outrage. Seeing the leaks for, i have yet to still see the next global passive one. Only rumors. I've already seen Cipher and Hyacine and there's none. I'm still waiting for the rumored ""emanators"" in Amphoreus like Phainon and Cyrene and more. There are global passive with them too according to rumors but it's not confirmed. I just wish the global passives will only affect overworld difficulty if hsr develops a more complicated overworld."
​@jaredjosephsongheng372  because it encourages this behavior in ALL upcoming gachas making any other possible game unplayable
" @zamatesenpai8815  
If it's unplayable then don't play it, soon enough they'll be in the red."
"​ @jaredjosephsongheng372 maybe we can stop being complacent and try to prevent it from happening in the first place?

This, ""just don't play""/""just ignore"" mentality is st*pid. We can't let the Hoyo community off the hook, because they fold like paper."
​​ @jaredjosephsongheng372 maybe we can stop being complacent and try to prevent it from happening in the first place? lol
" @_TheStormThatIsApproaching  
What if we let this happen, won't this also lead to more of these greedy Gacha companies to be exposed? And having them be more exposed means we can end up dealing damage to them.
Ubisoft, EA, ActiVision and many others tried prioritizing Profit over actually making good games, and see what has happened to them now?"
 @jaredjosephsongheng372  blud. That's not through complacency that we “expose” anything. You've got it completely confused. Nice try though.
" @_TheStormThatIsApproaching  
Complacency is a risk, but it's a risk we should be willing to make.
I'm saying we should leave the Hoyo community to themselves and we attack anyone else who does this except Hoyo.
Like that shouldn't be too hard, we have many communities here now.
And with games such as Ananta, NtE and all of those other games coming out that probably have Gacha systems similar to WuWa then Hoyo will eventually fade into obscurity won't it????
By attacking them, we are merely making them ignore what's in front of them because someone is attacking a game they really like."
"There is a reason, we call ""Hoyotards"", they slurp anything their master throws at them."
"People are not folding, they just aren't pathetic like you clowns, even f2p player are literally getting 77 free pulls, why are you crying in a false reality that your echo chamber creates?😂"
" @jaredjosephsongheng372  that isn't the reason, its because they are toxic players, hate on everything that isn't Mihoyo, even though Kuro proven they doing it better"
" @jaredjosephsongheng372  wasting your breath you have no clue what you talking about, when toxic community props up CC's, it gives green light to Mihoyo to do shitty practices.  If people will still spend on a shit product of course they will go steam ahead"
just let be hoyotards keep being idiot and playing their game..   at least we left for good
"Ironically, the only comparison I can make now is the following:
Kuro: has terrible launch and other stuff, but after a while enters great redemption arc (both PGR and WuWa);
Hoyo: nice launch and stuff (HSR, ZZZ), but lives long enough to be become a villain."
"Lmao it's not that serious. It's just a character, you guys are a joke 😂"
​ @LittleAngryOwl  to be fair genshin had awfully shit launch if it aint for tje pandemic its just an another gacha game
​ @Pray2Herta  your life is a joke
"@ryiune  yeah, I've heard about it, and that's why I mentioned only those two."
" @_TheStormThatIsApproaching  
My comment got removed so that's great"
" @kyotheman69  
That's like a mere small percentage of the community.
Idk why you guys are so mad about a small percentage of the entire whole."
" @kyotheman69  
No sh(i)t Sherlock I said to stop attacking the players, not the CC's."
 @adriantepes4355  Their behavior on twitter really doesn't help also honestly.
"No. They wouldn't. Kuro is a game made for whales. They will do exactly what they want, like they have been. Your opinion doesn't matter and you know nothing of what they would do."
"​ @arsmariastarlight3567 
I see what you did there."
Belobog era was the best time I spent on a game in while... thinking back about it brings me to tears.
 @citoyenneteavanttout7273  it just easy to read. Not so deep. Extra part of belobog about sell the land to company more depth but hsr player cant read:)). idk why they never talk about wardance and hoolay when he is most great vilian we eveer have
It was improved. Penacony + Amphoreus is already better
" @TypeMoonFanSashi  nah Penacony was a mess of a story where the direction felt like it shifted from patch to patch, and Amphoreus loses several points because the presentation is god awful"
 @XBladeVanitas  Presentation was already improved since 3.1 and I agree to disagree.
"⁠ @XBladeVanitas panacony had better ideas, belobog was like any mid shonen storie"
"@clip9896  better ideas don't mean anything if the execution is terrible.

Penacony was schizophrenic from update to update with cliffhangers that just get hand waved off without any real payoff, and other major events just happening off screen."
"Yeah, the Space China arc was a sheer disappointment given that one of the Astral Express members and one of the Stellaron Hunters shared a deep history with that place...only for it to be skimmed over because ""muh gacha."" What a waste of what could have possibly been the best arc only for it to be the ABSOLUTE WORST."
"​ @XBladeVanitas For real, Penacony arc was mid and much of the new characters were boring in my opinion."
 @TypeMoonFanSashi keep slorbgorbin hoyoverse lol
 @tubadude07  Sorry that I really enjoy the Stories and Not repeat everything a CC Said :)
 @TypeMoonFanSashi  Presentation improved but it's still considered baby steps compared to Genshin which already looks cheap compared to WuWa.
 @bunnysenpai8942  Well that's the Wuwa Community in a nutshell. Getting down to Genshin Tier in Terms of toxic behavior.
The loufu was ok to but after thst zip
​ @TypeMoonFanSashi hoyoturd detected lol
​ @TypeMoonFanSashi People just love to complain lol
"​ @XBladeVanitas no, not really. 

I like Penacony, actually. Yes, there are countless flaws (e.g. moralism and forced moral high ground, unnecessary dialogues in the main quest that makes it unnecessarily overstretched) but the general diversity of characters, the worldbuilding and its visual aesthetics, philosophy and vibes were unmatched. Personally, Aventurine, Sunday and a part of Acheron's stories were my top favorites. (Aventurine at top though) Some of smaller issues was Acheron's involvement in the whole plot and her unnecessary appearance most of the time. Same applies to the Trailblazers, since Sunday had solid philosophical and metaphysical backing to validate him. I wrote a 5.5k letter essay about that and Sunday, but I'll keep it to later. Masked Fools were nice (especially Sampo) but the Hanu adventures and Sparkle 'side' shenanigans were a bit unnecessary"
"@SolariusAureum  nah Penacony was a mess if you actually follow everything that's happening in the plot.

Firefly and Robin get ""killed"" setting up a mystery.
2.1 gets side tracked by Aventurine's entire story till the end where ""Oh! Gallagher is revealed as the one behind the deaths in Penacony!""
2.2 immediately throws all that away because ""Death"" is the only way in the dream to reach the place Gallagher wanted to show everyone, because reasons that aren't clear? Does this mean later on Death stabbed Boothill to get there for the really stupid monkey crap that's the absolute worst thing I have ever seen story wise.
Sunday and the Order just being the surprise villain at the end felt really rushed. The pacing was all over the place and felt like Hoyo couldn't focus on just one thing, along with the fact that no one in Penacony can just speak normally. They all have to speak in the most drawn out cryptic nonsense.

Not even gonna say anything about Sparkle because she really didn't matter in the slightest."
" @XBladeVanitas  some of you said is true. But the rest is just pure babble, Sunday & Order being the actual antagonists wasn't really a surprise if you actually followed up the build-up from earlier and the philosophy dialogue they were presenting. 

But yeah, to me, Acheron's part vs Aventurine and the ones in that range is what felt rushed and horrible to me though."
"​ @TypeMoonFanSashi  well some WuWa players are old Genshin players, so..."
"If you think this is laughing matter wait brother there 3-5 more charectors are coming with ridiculous global passive like crit,speed buff 😂😂😂😂😂... It's pure comedy with hoyo and it's cc, playerbase"
Isn't that just admitting you have a superiority complex?
" @jaredjosephsongheng372  Honestly, the right terminology would be the commoner who has simple enjoyments and consistently has good fortune, shaking thar head at the sight of `rich folks` who brag about being so successful, but they are actually in crippling debt and those `rich folks` keep denying the fact they are literally strapped to a machine pumping blood out of them to pay off said debts.

And really its better to have a positive healthy outlook that simply sees and gets things in life that are just good in general, then having to ignore with `toxic positivity` even when they have nearly 80% or more of the cast they pulled for even years in a game being replaced by a bunch of units that are even more expensive then nearly half of the cast you pulled in those years...

Just like how plenty of people got overly pissed at the insanely expensive `skins` in league of legends including the whole `Faker skin for Ahri`, which even Faker would not use it(since i recall he was the type of person to not use skins in LoL as far as i remember) and it apparently would cost something like high hundreds to acquire said skins and it even resulted in players straight up dodging games soon as anyone used said skin to never wanting to see that whale skin ever in that game.

Point n case though: Too many companies got overly greedy and need to enjoy some restraints being slapped on to reel them back into more reasonable practices, since some straight up made mobile gaming businesses too lucrative of a cash cow due to unrestraint practices."
 @Requiem20  never a speed buff man. It conflict to antifact
" @jaredjosephsongheng372  i mean, why not 🤣

even those upcoming games such as Ananta, Arknights Enfield etc. will also laugh at Hoyoverse for their Donkey brain tactics, and the CCs of Hoyo and playerbase (hoyoshills) of Hoyo are also bunch of Donkeys grouped in a single community at this point


i HAVE LONG SINCE LOST TRUST IN HOYO GAMES and even have hoyo trauma towards other Gacha games"
" @keous5644  
And this kinda thing and attacking Hoyo community always is what really steps back progress for change in Hoyo games ngl.
The more people attack, the more the community will unite, the more the community unites, the less of a chance we will have any form of change occuring."
 @keous5644  My Only Trauma are PvP gacha Games because they are 100% P2W
And this is why I hate the kuro community they think they are better just because they play a different game
"​@Jithu_Chilukuri of course better because kuro know how to treat player not like hoyo who love drain player money with making problem and sell solution into new character.

Don't forget Powercreep makes old characters useless even they give them away for free"
" @Rey-mw3rk  That's why ZZZ and HSR will have character buffs :)
And no.. Nobody is better for enjoying a different game. This elitist mindset of you is the reason why people start to hate the genshin Community in the First place. It's kinda ironic that many wuwa Players adapt this toxic behavior."
"Same Been playing PGR for 3 years now. The moment I saw Kuro was making an open world game, I quit genshin right after that. I just knew they were gonna deliver, and they did😊"
"​TypeMoonFanSashi done yapping? First buffed characters doesn't mean make character overpower, just make it have average dmg like 1-2 patch newest support, and i dont think that buffed character will last long.

Second this elitist doesn't make community get hated because i speak to actual fact that hoyo is greedy and always give mid content or storytelling, make the game is deserve to get alot criticism but they only listen to cn community lmao.

for genshit getting alot hate is because their first anniversary is shit and start bombing 1 star review to any other game/app, that action make genshit is become public enemy, then always compare to any new openworld game to their game and start ""genshin killer"" statement (ig they stop comparing because already lose to wuwa, so cant compare to new openworld like nte, ananta, wangyue, ak enfield, etc) after that, playing victim when their loved game is lose cuz shit quality because their dev is lazy to improve (start saying ""why wuwa always compare to us"", ""comparing waves"" 😂).

Well only ZZZ is last chance, if they do same like gi and hsr its over for hoyo."
"You think enjoying Kuro games makes you some elite ""rich"" gamer? Nah. It’s just a preference, not a status symbol both have their merits, but this ""rich vs. homeless"" analogy? That’s not a hot take; it’s just delusional"
@Jithu_Chilukuri it's an analogy dummy
"​@Jithu_Chilukuri ""rich and homeless"" change that analogy to player and cashcow if u dont get what i mean"
@  yeah right you guys just hate the game because its not giving freebies that's it  f2p players are so entitled
"@  yeah another ""hoyo bad"" guy"
"You can call Hoyoverse:

Hoyoshill
Hoyoshit
Hoyogreed
Hoyotrash
Hoyoturd
Etc."
" @Rey-mw3rk   yall love to talk abt powercreep, genshin has been here since 2020 yet you can beat the whole game with characters up to 1.4"
"​ @__dinho  yea thx to element reaction, but can hsr do the same with old character? Each game has their problem like gi qol locked behind limited character, and hsr is powercreep."
​@Jithu_Chilukuri whatever u said but i regret spending my money for bp in this game
" @Rey-mw3rk  hsr is buffing old characters on the next patch, most of genshin qol works on any character"
It's even better being a PGR player. We just keep WINNING!
@RealFrenchGaming I love  PGR
"I'm glad I quit Honkai: Star Rail the moment Acheron joined the game. I noticed how unfair it was—why can't Seele deal this kind of damage? The game feels completely unbalanced now because new characters deal way more damage than the older ones, making early units feel totally outclassed.

The reason I even started playing HSR was because of a friend. But when I pointed out how broken Acheron was, he just said, “Maybe it’s because of the lore.” I told him we should quit and check out other gacha games instead. When Wuthering Waves was about to drop, I told him we should play that—but he refused, saying he couldn’t handle another gacha game.

Honestly, I think the real reason he can’t quit HSR is because he's stuck in the loop of predatory meta-creep characters, and he's too deep in to see how bad it’s gotten."
"Same here. I never played HSR (Genshit was a lot for me), but glad to see another Hoyoboobs game fall down.
- Not because I hate Hoyboobs, but because I want them to feel threatened.
- I want them to stop playing the deaf & blind and start listening
- I want them to stop releasing childish, silly updates designed for under-5s.
- I want them to go back to the roots, to the true story, God's wars, dark plots, evil organizations, Dragons lurking in the shadows,
- I want more of Dainsleif, the Fatui, the 5 Sinners, the Hexenzirkel, the Abyss Order, the Prémordial Dragons, Niblung, the 4 shining shades, khaenri'ah, Celestia, and the big taboos
Who the F* cares about ""Cowgirl Cena"", Ben 10, Sharkgirl, or a fangus?
We are talking about calamities that wiped out entire nations. Gods Wars and Hoyoboobs want me to hear the cute story of Sandslash pokémon"
I left it after the first area. It got boring really fast to me.
"Same 🤣 I play Wuthering and I'm like ""really is this the shit you play and defend?"""
"December 2024, uninstall, even if they offer 20k stellar jade, I'm good."
Same
"I sell my account 2.6/2.7(Forgot, it was Firefly rerun & Sunday/Fugue banner) include GI and havent regret anything, just enjoy some drama because the community that defend this shlt is looks like a clown which makes it funnier."
I left a little bit after getting Silver Wolf and her light cone. Which was good because she got completely shafted by Hoyo in later updates.
"i wish i never played, mihoyo is awful company got lazy devs 
Hi3 was there only decent game"
" @GameOnline16  hoyboobs wtf is that? most call them Mihoshills, or Hoyoshills"
"​@Emptiness771 we are too, one less clown to see on the community,  oh no I forgot you pretenders are always around dispite your numerous claim on quitting"
I'm glad I quit this game after I finishing penacony main quest.
More interesting than the game sometimes bro like its good but there js almost nothing to do 😅 this is like our pvp content
"I was started playing HSR because I want some turn based strategy game, at first it was like that it was fun you need to build team comp with same weaknesses enemies has but now it’s just bigger DMG no strategy or brain needed to play this game you just boom they’re dead, unbalanced power level that keeps on power creep every patch and every thing go way too fast to the point you need to pull most of the new unit to clear end game witch is 80% of the game without it, this just a dry ass game that you wait an entire month for new story, and so I quit"
Exactly! TB is just a meme generator at this point. Not the main character.
Some people believe that TB is a good MC.
Look I understand calling him a meme generator or irrelevant but weak? MC right now is pretty strong being a demigod and all that stuff
" @Ilikegames804  I guess so but TB is not enough to solo Dan heng by his dragon form, welt casually using a black hole, or even fighting a bug that almost killed him, I just hope he will have some training arc shit as such and he doesn't need to rely on other's to be honest, as the new story of 3.2 the option of saying: Acheron is here and such which is stupid and it means he wanted help like I know it's a joke option but no man you're not sampo"
In HSR you can pull for the characters that you like if and only if you are a tourist
"@adriantepes4355  That's true. I'm not a newbie in the gacha space though, just in my own personal place & pace"
wait thats so real
"i don't think it'll just be the patch, but it summarizes it neatly"
"I have a feeling this wont impact hoyo much, the community will be different but ppls will still eat this up"
"​ @Saberdud  facts 😂 you don't know what is the issue Gentard now is more handful than castorice issue alone 
gets fine for 20 million dollars
they randomly fire alot of their employees
En VA'S are all rampaging 
All CC'S are quiting their games including gentard .
Then Now their mascot VA EN rampaging 
and they will face Plagirism 
in the court soon lol from a certain game company becuz of plagrisim of music lol 😂
now its hoyo's fall down as whole not just  hsr devs alone"
Castorice killed the game
"​@k-BlazeWW30
20 million is like nothing to them.
They fired their localizers, because they s(u)ck.
EN VA's got called out for trying to make a Monopoly and are crashing out over it.
Idk about all CC's since I've seen a couple start to get back into the fold.
Paimon VA started crashing out because she's a b(i)tch.
Weird, it's been so many months now and what happened to that Lawsuit?
Oh right yeah the same company that filed the ""Lawsuit"" for Onmyoji Plagiarism also decided to steal music from Genshin."
"​ @Exoskel2 
Castorice is death after all, so yeah."
WUWA is the BEST GAME
​ @Exoskel2  Castorice will be one of their biggest banners ever. So quite the opposite.
Hold up this writing is fire?
Awaken ratking lvl 999

now jokke defending hsr from a bald guy
it's like a new arc saga"
another ratsu....Mr Pokke :face-blue-wide-eyes:
Oh yes trolling a guy because he gave a different opinion from me
"@Jithu_Chilukuri Opinions can be divided to correct and wrong ones. pokke said one thing, then another, and now he and his community defending hoyo, going against well-being of playerbase. This is example of wrong opinion. 
Tectone said one thing, then repeated, then repeated, then rep... And his community warns others about game getting worse, and tries to take action to prevent the fall using objective facts. This is example of correct opinion."
Trolling a dude cuz he is the one to throw an aoe taunt every evening ​@Jithu_Chilukuri
​@Jithu_Chilukuri exactly. These can't be real people.
"​ @leathermage   no, that's not how opinions work. Also, what is this made up bullshit y'all have crafted? Lmao. And Tectone is a moron. He's not a saint, for taking a stand in a game he doesn't play lmao."
​ @ronron_gaming soon zzz version
he's friends with the rat lord what yall expect 😂
YES LET THAT TRASH GAME ROT IN HELLL
Same will happen with ZZZ. Players think their Dev is god send. But Miyabi's release is already a grim foreshadowing of whats next
 @pikaachoo3888  we'll see at the very least if the dev note hold through till 2nd aniv.
 @zacknothere9982  i already know they will give us hollow zero skill in end game content:)) omg i feel like my value of pull not get powercreep it just increse every patch if they really do that. Somebody will pull old character because a lot of skill set they get from hollow zero. Genius move
"But what’s even worse is they can’t even leave to greener pastures. Given how they’re already barred from WuWa, they’ll have to settle for WVD which I heard has MUCH shittier gacha than the big CN games, so yeah they’re cooked."
"Already seen this coming because I played HI3. Once powercreep in HSR skyrocketed, I knew instantly it's heading down the same path as its predecessor."
"​ @mleong75 
Let me guess, HI3 has just as bad powercreep as HSR?"
"Let me break it down for you, it's cause they're different games 🤯"
​ @pikaachoo3888  moronic comment.
"​ @CultureAdd1ct  Let me break it down for you, it's the same company , same company policies"
"couldn't care less actually, some people are just over concern about meta - they cannot stand if they cannot have the best characters & the best clears... whereas they are others who may not necessarily clear moc or anything, 

but still enjoy the game for it's story & unique take on turn based gameplay 

- upon the issue of meta, this can cause problems yes

but to a carefree chap that enjoys story & aesthetic, they couldn't care less

still people should quit if they want to, that's best for them"
"@whydoyouask7786   First of all, people who care a lot about the meta just pull for the most meta units, that's just another strategy  for gachas to make money. What you're complaining about is most likely the people who complain about powercreep, which is valid, cause it'll start to affect people like us most; people who don't whale on characters or endlessly chase the meta"
​ @rickynguyen5108 it was very bad but not anymore .
" @vergil9023  
I doubt that. Considering that this IS Mihoyo we're talking about, HI3 still has terrible powercreep."
​​​ @rickynguyen5108 not as much as before they somewhat fixed it trust me it's better than hsr and I have been playing Hi3 for more than 3 years now.
" @pikaachoo3888  I only played ZZZ briefly and managed to get both Miyabi and her Engine.

Other characters just don't hit the same, it every sense of the term.

(Forgive me, Ben. It's not you... okay, actually, it kinda is)."
"Relax lil bro it's not that serious 😂, it's just ONE character. Holy Sh, you guys are a joke"
so far w genshin im doing okay and have decent characters but i dont have enough resin to properly build them so theyre kinda bad atm
"​ @Pray2Herta I know right? They will whine ""but the precedent it sets"" when they have nothing but giant leaps in assumptions and guessing to justify their outrage.

They complain that not every update has a massive climactic finale. A bunch of them want a skip button cause they never cared about story at all.

Is the game perfect? No. Has it given me incredible moments and characters? Absolutely."
"and I will never understand the need of people to one up each other over playing video games or insult those people as side watchers, are we really that dumb as a species now that we have to compete about what entertain us? idiots, every single one of you"
i was hopeful as i enjoyed the game but i saw signs coming of this
​ @rickynguyen5108  I'd honestly say it's worse since the weapons and stigmatas (basically like relics/artifacts) are gotten from gachas and only some really weak alternatives can be crafted
"@cosmixhuo 
What, really? So there's nothing F2P that is nearly as good as the gacha weapons and stigmata since only very weak alternatives could be made? I know HI3 was terrible with its powercreep, but to not this extent.

Yeah, HI3 has no hope left in itself. Like every game that Mihoyo has made, the sooner it dies, the better for everyone's sanity."
"@rickynguyen5108  yeah I'm taking a break from playing it because of that despite it having my absolute favorite characters like Elysia and Kiana (the mc) but the lack of f2p options for my characters pmo so bad I just stopped. I never really deleted my account or anything I just stopped playing it. This plus the story is @ss after the mc kinda ""disappeared"". It's a long story too (literally xd).

I'm really sad that hsr is rather quickly descending down the path of its predecessor since at the beginning it had lots of hope and even during Penacony I had a strong feeling that it could be a great game due to the hype it evoked in the community me included. It was truly peak. And then Amphoreus happened and everything went downhill. It's sad and even more so seeing wuwa doing much better though the community there isn't my favorite to be entirely honest. But this is just my take lol"
🤡 its genshin players who think that they are better. Ofcourse you guys were praying on the downfall of star rail. I personally cant stand genshin players. So whiny and elitist 😂 . Yall always bashed every nee game out in hopes of recruiting others into genshin
"@cosmixhuo 
I like Kiana as a main character too. Elysia was written well. Whether she comes back as good as ever remains to be seen, especially with the current story being complete GARBAGE compared to Part 1. The current story leaves a LOT to be desired."
@rickynguyen5108  yeah from what I've seen in the hi3rd official page on insta it's gotten so random I'm genuinely confused and then the random mentions of Kiana like wasn't she on the moon?? And the way the designs feel so...lackluster lately. The same color scheme over and over again. I miss the senti era ngl.
"@cosmixhuo 
Agreed. Mihoyo are nothing more than pathetic lazy losers now. HI3 is basically a weak shell of its former self. Designs are bland, generic, and boring. The sheer randomness in the current story is just pure trash."
"In the next six months or more, there will be no characters with global passives. I wonder what people's reaction will be if nothing happens after that amount of time."
​ @ЯрославПодгорный-х3м  there will be more to come
phainon is confirmed to have a global passive this game is a goner
​ @NotSamaXD  no
"​ @adriantepes4355  it's clear, but I have big doubts that it will happen in the next year and that it will be game-breaking"
People said the same thing during Pennacony... it's just delaying the realization
Exactly they are so entitled
Never going back. Hoyoverse is dead to me. They've proven time and time again that they are anti consumer.
Honkai fumbled so Hard
❤❤❤
I Guess Castorice is not bringing you back 😂
Don't play gatcha games and your soul is free
I'd rather play Arknight or Blue Archive because it's one of those decent gacha games compare to those Hoyogreed games.
Costumers are those who pay not f2p
​ @Snyro arknights and BA 300 pity lmao
"​​ @Certifiedprecog27809 
>I would ratha play Arknighas and blue archive mayne, dey got za best gaytcha gaem system brah

*Same stuff as HSR but indie"
"only you dead, the sales of Castorice is crazy good, better than firefly, wuwuwawa can only kiss hsr feet, not even one percent of hsr sales"
It's your fault playing Gacha games 😂
​@Snyro  bro what...
"I can understand and get behind the idea that you want the game to be better, but at the same time I think youre looking at it wrong if your requirements for it to be better is essentially to be more complex and have all those mechanics you speak of other turn-based RPGs generally have. It is not the design intent they are striving for to make the game as complex as those RPGs. That should be quite clear. Does that mean the game cant improve? No, they can improve and do their interpretation of the genre better, but I dont think the solution to that is by making it more complex."
"You really think it's impractical for most players not to engage with endgame? Endgame is mostly what you see content made around online, but I really do think it's true that most are just there for the story and some surface level engagement with the combat. Between the teenagers enamored with the world and characters more than the gameplay, and older working adults that don't have the time or energy to sink into hardcore gameplay, there are large demographics of people who are totally casual with the game. Heck, my mother plays the game and she cannot stand combat focused content. Simulated Universe is her worst nightmare. They're out there, and in great number. To them, the little side quests, collectables, and hidden jokes ARE the content to go alongside the main story. The minigame events are there for a reason.

Good video by the way. Just thought that particular take was a bit silly."
"Global passive shows they are more interested in selling stuff for your account, and not make interesting team balance"
"Pretty reasonable take. Especially like the 300$ item analogy, it was 100% ON SPOT.
Same thoughts about passive, it ain't something to worry about by itself, it just can have a real bad consequences if the right things fall into wrong hands.
And, yeah, I am also feeling a bit down about state of the game too. I've used to spend on the battle pass AND monthly sub, but now it is just sub and I am thinking about stopping that too... Weird feel, because I like the characters and am still invested into some of 'em, like I am currently hoarding all the currencies I manage to get into Castorice fund, no whaling though, only daily drops and what you can get by playing, buuuut I am just not feeling to spend time inside the game aside of daily activities... Feels bad, man."
"I appreciate your opinion bro, one of the clearest statement video out there about this global passive, nice video i watched it until the end"
"Personally I felt cringe with feixiao being Super Saiyan in her ult, but Im not saying she is bad or horrible or whatever, it's my irrelevant opinion. And also, I came here to see what exactly is going on that makes everyone hate the game so much with Castorice or global passive, as I'm not sure what the problem is. And to be fair, I think Im part of the minority that is completely fine with the game. I have no issues with the story. The only issue I have is the current protests, which is somewhat understandable, AI is trash, but this is kind of being taken over the top a bit. I don't really know much and it must be ignorant of me to not be as educated, but currently people have gotten too comfortable in complaining about every small detail. Every patch people are complaining about it, or are complaining about the same small thing, like a list of who knows what, for what knows who, to be able to whatever the everwhat, much easier. 
Im also just ranting, my brain is scattered too, so i may be more incoherent in what I typed and I apologize for that. Also sorry about the opinions I have, but they're my opinions nonetheless. Thank you for reading this."
OR..OR.. hear me out.. you are tolerating bad and ungrateful devs and you are mostly part of the bigger problem and is why the game is not yet dead but 100% guaranteed heading in that way in its earliest date
"I don't chase Meta, I play endgame and get what I can and if I can't get all 36 stars... I don't care... but that's me."
"I personally don't care about anout the global passive. I just play HSR and enjoy the game. People who made can be mad about it... but they act like children at this point. All these adult are just kids pretending to be adult. Now no player should play a game they don't enjoy, but don't attack those who still enjoy it. And those who enjoy it... don't attack those who hates it. People who say leave, yeah just leave. I don't care if it drops views, etc... this will teach Hoyo to change their game. If you are unhappy... uninstall the game and stopped talking about it... this goes for CC as well."
Can’t wait to drop at least $500 next week 🥰
Lmao. Dislyte now dogshit maximum predatory game...
Bro I advise you stop using big words if you don't know how to pronounce them 😂
"The people saying ""most HSR players don't play or care about end game"" are in fact Mihoyo fake social media accounts spreading propaganda so people don't complain about the companies predatory practice."
I’m far to invested into the game to quit playing now. I actually look at leaks so I knew this global pass was coming. And I properly saved for it.
"Huh I'm like 50/50 with your opinion on people quitting about ""Castorice"" global passive. As someone who has quit before the passive and once I heard the leaks about the passive, it solitifed my ideals to quit, I dont think everyone quit to bandwagon, but I see your point. I think more people should have maid a stink about Arheron and her talent being quality of life locked behind her first so, I understand.

as I am watching the video. I totally agree."
has anyone checked  how china feels  about the current HSR cause by now the devs already know that americans love to complain and in recent years have become  insufferable  ruining gaming companys  and what not but also their core audience is china not america
Classic iyo take lol
"just want to say, the idea that f2p don't matter (something i've seen a lot, including in comments) is actually false. they just matter in a different way. for example, during the genshin boycott, though i was also upset by the situation and felt the disrespect, i knew the majority of players were still going to spend and/or play. in fact it was encouraged to play but not spend because of server costs...???it was never worth getting into this with anyone but i saw legit one person ever mention it: f2p matter from a numbers perspective. literally ""hey investors, hey advertisers, hey sponsors! look at how many ACTIVE players we have"". so technically fully quitting hurts a bit, but not in the way most people think it does. it doesn't hit their bottom line because at the end of the day, any company offering ""free"" games technically has to be able to sustain the game as if no players are spending"
"The problem with HSR is it's only premeditated.

I've said this for a long ass time and the pushback I got was ""ALL JRPGS ARE PREMEDITATED"" 

This is incorrect and if you think that you've not played enough good JRPGs. HSR is about what team you have and what relics they have equipped, after that you can just do a rotation and win. Vast majority of other JRPGs are about the tactics you use within the fight itself.

This is not to say some parts of JRPGs aren't premeditated, there is prep that you can do to make the fights easier, but there is a healthy balance between strategy during the combat and premeditation before it.

HSR has very little strategy within the moment, It attempts to offload that lack of depth in it's boss designs, but it's already losing compared to a JRPG that breath and depth in character actions alongside boss/enemy design.

Ironically a huge problem with Genshin Impact is the pre-meditated nature of it. Beating Abyss is about the team you build, after that you just bash out your rotations. 🤷"
I dont mind the approach to the battle design and having auto fun button. But im missing the ability to use items in battle
mihoyo account
"I do think there are number of people that don’t care about endgame maybe they play it maybe they don’t but they def just care about enjoying the story 

I remember I was watching I creator and they were near the place were you do APOC and they said this mode is for tryhards and that blew my mind someone who has dedicated a relevant portion of their life to this game thinks that one of the few things to actually do and use your characters for us only for the highest percent of players not for ur average player so yes a there is meaningful amount of people that don’t care about endgame who spend money on the game so why would hoyo care"
"I was a day 1 player, and I loved the game   at the beginning. Hell the only reason I even gave it a try was because I sucked at turn based games, and I thought HSR would help me learn how to play them better. 

But by the time 2.5 came out, I didn't like direction it was going so I dropped it. Luckily I stopped playing it without spending too much money on it like i did when i was playing Genshin."
"the only time genshin folded somehow was with the zhongli drama, as for star rail i cant recall anything"
This game is a shit show
"The only way to win the battle it's move on, you can't talk to someone who is ignoring you, thaan i did it, i was waiting for the Collab, but this live make it clear, this company don't care even for the low spender, so if you don't care about me, is natural that you lose me."
"Honestly, I’m at a point where I might be done with Honkai: Star Rail—not because of the game itself, the global passive, or the so-called lack of content. I've played all the content as an F2P since day one and it's fun most of the time, and I’ve actually been more invested in Zenless Zone Zero lately. But what’s really been pushing me away is the community.

It’s become so toxic and entitled at times. I get it—people want content that excites them, and they take the game more seriously than others. That’s fair. But some folks forget this game is going to be what the devs want it to be, and it's not going to be for everybody which is okay. Most players are just here for the story, the characters, and a chill experience.

I think there’s a huge divide between casual and hardcore players, and the hardcore side often comes off as loud and arrogant—acting like their way to play is the only right way, and everyone else is wrong. That attitude is what kills the vibe.

If someone’s unhappy with the game, quitting is totally valid. But the constant negativity and aggression towards the game and community? That’s what makes it unbearable. If I stop playing Star Rail, it’s not because of the devs—it’s because of the community."
Off topic: your room is looking so tidy that my OCD is at peace.
Im gonna take a break from this game for awhile jusg dont have the drive to want to play anymore
"Um, what?
Seriously, characters already do this, but you need them in the team to work. Is the game impossible if you use a Firefly team that doesn’t have an E2 Fu?

This is a Gatcha game. They add character mechanics that make the game easier in new characters. As long as the existing characters can still beat the game, even if a bit more difficult, there really isn’t a problem"
"I know I can’t quit the game since I enjoy it on occasions along with the story. For me, I’m just not gonna summon for Castorice. Anaxa just seems a bit better for my account."
"I quit because the game doesn’t offer anything competitive, no guilds, no leader boards, no PvP. It’s just a anime that you can play with the characters. Turn base game players are competitive"
"Castorice is just another nail in the coffin that is HSR's Death Knell at this point. So much missed opportunity, lack of innovation, lack of meaningful mechanics. Fan favorite characters are no longer viable, or relevant in the story - It's fallen to an unfortunate cycle of catering almost exclusively to the repeat spenders (100+ a patch) because the $15/$25 monthly stuff isn't nearly enough with the character throughput they're going for. And that's fine, ultimately, it's the devs' choice to make it so aggressive to replace old units. I just don't vibe with the current trajectory, or really any of the characters anymore."
"Regarding the argument around 13:35. F2P players actually matter. One of the main reasons whales whale, even if it isn't a conscious thing, is for the bragging rights. ""I have a better account than most people"". If there aren't any f2p players, a big incentive for whales to spend money is gone. This increases with online competitive games, i believe there are some pvp gachas out there or gachas with leaderboards ( hi3rd ). If there aren't f2p players, those whales arent better than anyone, why would they whale for a leaderboard where everybody whales. To some degree this applies to single player gachas. Let's be honest, at some point, everyone of us bragged about how well build a character is or look, i got lucky and got the character and the weapon, or i got 1-2 dupes of this character. Hope I made my argument clear.

tldr: whales subconsciously or consciously whale to be better than the average f2p player. not having f2p players in the ecosystem means whaling is even more pointless than it already is, because they ain't better than anyone. this increases with multiplayer gachas or gachas with leaderboards"
"The way I spend around these gacha games has been maybe i get the daily pass, the battlepasses, and then the first time top ups to guarantee a character or two and that’s based on how I felt playing the game for the previous year. I pull waifu over meta most of the time. It just so happens the waifus I pull (plus Aventurine) are meta or will be much like the cases of Jade and Topaz. There are some sacrifices that need to be made like I can’t pull every waifu so my account lacks characters like Robin and Lingsha. Hard choices have to be made and some endgame cycles are more painful than others.

So yes im pulling castorice"
"I’ve been annoyed with the game for a while now. I never pulled for Acheron (Aventurine was a far more important grab for me). I didn’t pull Yunli as I hate her character and her entire introduction made her seem like a disrespectful brat. And then I didn’t pull Feixiao, Lingsha or Fugue because I wanted other characters. And I was punished for it with how powerful mobs were growing. I have no powerful Wind DPS for instance apart from Black Swan. 

They don’t encourage variety anymore like they did before. 

I usually am annoyed doing SU or DU. They can be fun but they’re tedious to go through just to have save files to begin farming for Planars. A whole other hunk of nonsense to do before you can farm necessary things. 

Looking back there were moments in Penacony where the story felt painful which is how 3.0 felt. I was so burnout from it that I didn’t explore once after the story. 

Then the one character I wanted from Amphoreus is just an autobattler. 

And the Global Passive was the final straw. If you’re reading this please know there are three more at least coming. I don’t care what your cope argument is. This should not be defended whatsoever. 

They will be building this game around assumptions of everyone having these GP characters. The others buff Attack and Skill Levels. You cannot defend this if you have a working brain for any form of forethought. 

I uninstalled after grabbing Mydei and will never look back."
"Tbf, using Cas as an Exit point is both a PR stunt and a good time to exit the game, the two are not in the opposite in the slightest

Is the proverbial last drop

11:00 I mean the one time where they admitted the fuck up was with Zhongli, but to THIS DAY there are units that do not work as intended"
Sigh...another Hoyo game I stop playing.  Please don't do this to ZZZ.
Leave the damn game go play A REAL turn base game
"10:52 -Genshin has too, Zhongli buffs and Neuvilette Bug revert. Both had zero reliance on the global playerbase to occur."
"ive started playing since jingliu's debut, my account has gone through many 50/50 losses but also many lucky pulls (some of them very lucky), most importantly ive spent a hefty bunch on the game. the decisions i made on my pulling choices have led my account to be in quite a good state, so I dont need castorice and ill probably go for the fox guy for my acheron instead, either way, I think the global passive is fine only if it also gets applied to 4 stars; but then again the last 4 star added was Moze and it was like 4 patches ago (cant remember)

whatever the situation may be im never spending money on HSR again, the game i loved is quite literally going downhill extremely fast and i dont see it in a good state in 2 years time with powercreep, hp inflation and now global passives. ill keep playing because i still love the story, enjoy the gameplay and like the game, but i wont hesitate to move on if im not having fun anymore lol"
"Yeah, people's too emotional about this game."
I just rearranged everything too. 😅
 @Iyoverse  Great work! I know is not easy to keep it that way though. Daily activities can get messy. 😂
"I feel the need to add this on. I don’t hate Castorice. She has a beautiful design, awesome animations, stupid damage and a freaking dragon. She was going to sell. 

But that’s exactly why they’re putting this on her. They know what they’re doing. They’ll use her guaranteed sales from people that just like her to push the other planned GP units. And it’s sickening."
And F2P that were planning to pull her anyway don’t care.
This is where you move on to final fantasy 14
I stopped spending my money on hsr for about a month now and at this point im just hanging on until the fate collab and if i see no changes in characters or modes im gonna leave and enjoy the storie through YouTube videos 🫠
"And the Rating of Honkai Star Rail on Google Playstore keeps Nose diving now down to 3.4 which is the lowest of all Hoyoverse games today.

WuWa - 4.7
ZZZ - 4.0
Genshin 3.8
HSR - 3.4

They now technically became the Second Genshin Impact. The Reviews Rained down lots of 1 star rating due to Powercreep, P2W shop and Global Passive."
"i never understood this comment about most players not doing endgame, as if they didn't need to do it to get currency to pull characters? these people think they give enough pulls on events and exploration? most exploration gives 6 pulls at best (each individual map) with annoying puzzles and SU gives tons of pulls but it takes so long to do it that unless you're willing to spend 30 hours farming that, you'll never have enough pulls to get any character

this patch literally had 2 events ""big"" events, and one of these you can finish in 2 hours and the other is just another SU revamp"
"For me, as long as the game has zero PVP, the global passive does not bother me."
"The only time I think Genshin ever folded was the outcry about Zhongli being weak. He got emergency buffed with the quickness. Oh right, and the recent Neuvillette thing where he got nerfed, then they took it back and gave us a free 10 pull because of it. Everyone was hoping they'd do that for Dehya, but nah, lol."
"100% take. I quit several months ago after playing a couple of hours of 3.0. The story honestly started falling off after Belabog.The fact that we don't have a skip button with summary, is crazy. I like story and dialogue, but not when it's bad. I've got better things to do than spam X. HSR was my main and I spent thousands on it, but as soon as my multi eidalon characters started struggling, i'm out.
For me to come back I'll need skippable dialogue with summary, better story and dialogue, make older characters relevant, dont waist my time by putting a mini game on overworld chests."
I'm only playing because I wanted to save enough pulls to get the Fate characters and thats it... After that I'm not sure what I'll do next if the mechanics of the game don't change for the better.
"What you said about people not only quit quitting the game over global passives might be true, but we're not gonna pretend like the passives aren't a massive melon sized cherry on top right???"
6:12 Bro forgot Gepard 😭
"My guy, you're talking about virtual currency that is infinite in quantity that Hoyo controls the value of. Fym ""people who complain about a $300 item are stupid""???? It's literally fake currency.
And the people are not complaining about us getting one for free, I literally didn't see a single person say that, people are (rightfully) complaining about how they added another feature that only helps whales whom majority of don't even need it, when they could have helped reduce the effect of powercreep on light spenders and F2Ps by making one gold ball cost 30 E6+ 4 stars or a number like that that is big enough to not be too friendly and make it limited to one gold ball per month/patch."
What do you mean by playing endgame? Usually just login once a patch complete story try and beat endgame and then just log off. Idk if thats counting “playing endgame” like the number of attempts is in single digits
"I agree with iyo point of view on the global passive, it's not castorice's passive the problem, the problem is in the future and a thing that nakes me mad is how they explained the global passive in the live. They said since castorice is CLOSE to death she wants to delay it's arrival, what the fuck kind of logic is that? If you're close to something you don't want to delay. 
And i also agree that there are a lot of other problems with the game that i would like to see resolved, for example the powercreep is there and we know, so i would like to see either more rewards or the hp inflation needs to slow down. This is a turn-based game you can't use skills like in another games to ""supply"" to the powercreep, zzz also as hp inflation and it's worse than hsr's on the timeline, but you don't feel it that much because you can use your skills to compensate"
"I think a better analogy for the golden ball is instead of ""crack and mcdonalds"" I would actually say ""you gave me 300$ to pay rent for 3.1, but now it's 3.2 and I need another 300$""

A free ruan mei is nice, if you don't need it you can just save the ball and use it on another character when they eventually become available in the rotation, but if they don't give us a reliable way to get this item, 1 free 1.x character isn't going to cut it, especially ruan mei, that is universal, true, but much more geared towards break teams and guess what archetype hasn't gotten much attention (other than DoT) since 3.x began

Other than that, yes, the value of the item might be 300$, you're essencially getting a limited character, but the characters that are going to be in the shop rotation aren't going to be worth the same as new characters. I think this is their way to still be able to ""sell"" older characters that most people will not waste pulls on a rerun, again ruan mei and other harmony characters are the exception, but right now 1.x characters are starting to go on rotation, we probably won't see 2.x characters on rotation until the end of 3.x or the beginning of 4.x, so those characters will most likely, given how things have been developong depriciate a lot in value, other than the harmony characters, robin, sunday, etc. I don't see many 2.x characters being worth pulling for when you have the 4.x hunt dps doing twice as much damage as feixiao (and mind you, feixiao is still pretty good, it's just that since she released no other single target character has, and characters that are AoE, such as therta, reach damage numbers equal if not higher than the single target dps, so what will happen when another single target releases? Yup, feixiao will be eclipsed)

The golden ball is a good start, if they give us 1 every patch, you can either slowly build teams or you could save them and go all in on a character you like when they go on rotation and e6 them (although I doubt that will be possible, they will probably put a limit of 2 characters or something that you can get through this shop), if they give us 1 silver ball per patch, it's less good, but it's the same deal, you can slowly build a team of you can play the long game, it's just that this time it'll take twice as long in a game that is constantly shifting with every single patch. For the golden ball to be worth anything it needs to be a resource like variable dice, rare, but you can get one per patch if you buy the nameless honor or one every other patch if you don't buy nameless honor. Do I like that model? No, I think it should be 1 per patch regardless if you spend or not, but this is hoyo, out of all greedy options, this is the one that benefits most players, especially since nameless honor has been getting more and more value with the introduction of the dice and the new resin"
"This video makes 0 sense to me. How TF is someone leaving the game because of a shitty change ""bull shit."" Everyone has a limit to the amount of schlop they will eat and the passive is a last straw.  Seeing how accepting everyone is of this too, nah we're out it's not a excuse speaking with you money or time."
"There is no harsh reality. The game has had aggressive power creep for a long time now. To the point you need new characters to some extent (usually supports) to clear the content. But no one is truly a must pull. Not having some characters make your account worse, but does not make the game unclearable (unless you skip all supports). The global passive idea could lead to the first true must pull characters. That is a reason to quit compared to before. This company gets no benefit of the doubt, we have every reason to believe they will double down hard on this. 
I agree with the title tho. This is the great filtering, the only people that will continue to play are those willing to deal with the bullshit and burn their wallets. And when they find out just how many people they have wrapped around their fingers, this will likely leak into the other games."
5:30 Iyo I hope you plan on checking out Expedition 33. It looks like its gonna be one of the most interactive Turn Based in a while 🔥🔥🔥
"The HSR team has forgotten the number 1 rule. People pull for characters, if a players favorite character becomes useless even in story mode. That is it."
If you quit this game what will this channel be about? Wuwa?
"Castorice damn, THE character that got all cc, wuwa glazers and hoyotards freaking the f out and bit*hing whining. I NEED her, gonna bring my girl home. I need her and her global passives asap."
"we have almost all patches for 2 events, what's new now?"
"I disagree somewhat with Iyo’s take on the end game. I play it to get jades but I only play it until I can’t clear on my first attempt. It’s not worth my time to get sweaty over those last few stars. 

I think that most people are probably the same they only play the endgame casually which means that, for them MoC, AS, and PF are just like another form of event mini game, not an important part of the game just a way to get a few more jades. 

From that perspective the endgame being 50% of the game is a wild exaggeration because you hardly need to spend any time on it to get most of the rewards that are on offer."
"A cherry on top to what? The game already being bad or like... the final straw? Personally, the global passive isn't what would break my camel's back. It's so insignificant in the grand scheme of the game itself that it doesn't matter if it's there or not. 

But, this is why I expressed my issues with HSR are not the same as everyone else's. People feel differently about this thing & that's their prerogative."
"@ Yeah a cherry on top of the already bad game design throughout HSR. The global passives are that ""cherry."" Either way it goes, I quit HSR last September because the game wasn't fun for me. Never even finish Luofu lol. The global passives just solidified me not returning"
"You might not have seen it, but I've seen plenty of comments & convos from streams at the time of recording this vid, discussing that very thing. There was even confusion about it in my own Discord. 

I, quite literally, don't give a single fuck if the item cost real world dollars or not; it's *valued* at $300, which is what I said in the video. I even used a quote directly from Cinna to help further explain what the sentiment is & why people treat it the way they do. 

F2Ps shouldn't care about something made FOR whales, if that's what the majority believe it's for (again, explained in the vid). If I work in the IT department, I'm not gonna care about what the maintenance crew receives when it doesn't effect me. However, I do absolutely agree with you that they could've done that regarding the Golden Ball, but they didn't. I can't play off of what ifs when discussing why I'm currently bothered by XYZ."
You're just not playing the game at all. You're worst than me at this point if you login once a patch. LOL
Completely understood & agreed with what you're saying here. That analogy would've been better to use too! Wish I would've thought of it during my rant. haha
"This video makes no sense because (I'm assuming since you didn't explain why), you came into the video to argue, not to listen. I clearly explained what my own issue was, then I explained that exact statement you're referring to in depth. That the ""shitty change"" doesn't actually change the game & it's been in a ""bad state"" for patches now. However, I get that you might've believed the game to be in a great state? Only you know that. 

I called it BS because the urge to leave should've already been there & enforced given the countless issues we've been expressing for over half a year now. I'm not calling someone leaving BS cause they choose to. I am, calling it BS if this SINGLE THING is what made me people suddenly hate the game/leave, when there's XYZ issues already present & worse than the infamous global passive."
"Yeah, gatcha games that over-powercreep are stupid. everyone has their older favourite characters, you alienate them all"
A lot of players want their characters to have a long term longevity especially they spend money on it.HSR should follow Genshin's path in term of powercreep so that everyone's favourite characters can be used if they get it.
"I play other gacha games, just haven't put much focus on them for the channel. I'll still fulfill my sponsorships & obligations with HSR (cause that helps pay my $), but I've been exploring more... ""How do I have fun with this game instead of XYZ"" games. Genshin, WuWa, Etheria Restart, Black Beacon, etc. 

Nothing is set in stone yet since I'm also waiting to see what happens with this HSR stuff too. I did geek out over Canterella though. lol She's such a good character."
19:08 Crack analogy was wild 🤣
"100% agree. I quitted a while ago too and the global passive wasnt the main reason (although global passives suck).
The game mechanics suck, the powercreep before global passive sucks, the storytelling sucks, the events are boring."
"Around the 9:15 mark about nobody playing the endgame... Mr.Dookie would like to have a chat with you.. Dont get me wrong, i agree with you about the endgame stuff. He says only 1% of the HSR players, plays endgame. Absolute BS, sure there some who only play for the story but to say 1% of the players ONLY does the endgame... he also used the Prydwen sampling size pool as his proof, but i saw that sampling size.. that sampling size doesnt tell you whether or not the accounts they scanned were dead accounts, if those accs were whales, goldfish, or f2p. The best part... massive reading skill issue for him cuz the way i read Prydwen's sampling size, its around 33% of the sampling size who does the endgame"
"I will prob log on, but not play. Going to get my jades from my daily logins first I think but I'm just losing interest. Penacony part 2 was peak for me. All else has been just above average at best.  I mean, how the heck you mess up Greek and Roman imagery beset by a Pantheon of Godlike beings...only Hojo knows.  But Wuthering Waves? That game cooks.

But the global passive isn't bullshit? You're assuming it's a final reason while completely refusing to address the concerns they have about it and how this is a precent that will be abused. Kind of a weak take."
"Last week they still sit on 4.1 rating on Google Play store, But now it  dropped to 3.4 Rating Now and is the lowest of all Hoyoverse Games with lots of Reviews concerning the new predatory systems, Powercreep and New Global Passive Mechanic."
"I don't wanna say I feel ""vindicated"", because it's not really all that deep, but I do find it funny that people have been having the sentiment that HSR just isn't a very good rpg. The entire reason I was hyped for the game is because a gacha TBRPG sounded great but it was just so mechanically uninteresting that I ended up quitting out of sheer boredom. Think I quit when Jingliu came out, whenever that was."
Speedowagon
"Wuwa 2.2 sets a new bar for what Gacha RPG can be, should be.  Playing HSR afterward felt like Hoyo is scamming me.  Mydei cutscene pisses me off. It's so short and rushed.  He's a limited character and Hoyo spent less effort animating his last-stand battles than what Kuro did for the FREE MC's battle."
"i dont know with you content creators. you treat it is like the end of the world. how can we be sure that you are concerned for the f2p players? or are you all cloutchasing what is happening to the game for your own monetary gain via views? shesss! stupidity.
hoyo dont give a fuck when you content creators quit. the game will continue"
"I'm not quitting right now, but once the greed gets out of control with the global passive that's when I''m out"
"Jokes on you guys, we NA servers are a minority compared to the Chinese servers, so hoyo isn't gonna cry for us. Also, the life culture of Easterner is almost workaholic, and they will gladly spend some cash to have account development rather than spend time they don't have. Because of that, the gacha games have the green light to make those choices."
"Your first point isn't true, because the global pass proves the game will never improve.  Before now people held out hope the game would improve. 

With this going through it's essentially the nail in the coffin.  And you know other games will follow their lead.

Remember when they said they would buff units for 3.2 back in 3.1? Now 2 months later saying to wait 4 more months with no info on the buffs and it's only for 4 characters.  

The powercreep hasn't changed,  they just increased hp again in the leaks. 

Sometimes you just gotta cut your losses. You're yelling at a wall.

Didn't genshin apologize for zhongli before buffing him?"
Dude what the global passive is terrible if it comes to other games including wuthering waves I will also quit those games. If they come to all of them well is what it is and have fun everyone. This mechanic will destroy any challenge in the game even after the disaster the meta was for star rail before this was announced and it will do so for every other game.
11:45 genshin did it with zhongli.
An item that you get for free that you have to pay $300 for more of is literally Crack.
"Just because they put a price on an item doesn't make it its actual value, doesn't matter if you get some for free, it's not worth $300."
"I just found you today and this is a really unique outlook from the typical one, Definitely worth listening and I’m looking forward to your future videos"
"I was a dolphin and didn't think twice to quit  the moment I couldn't skip the Penacony banana garbage story, it drained all the fun I had for the game. Looking at the direction the game is going, I made the right decision."
Looking for a reason to quit <--- Assumption
"The value of the gold ball isn't $300, its $0. It's a digital currency, there is zero scarcity. The only reason it's ""worth"" $300 is because hoyo says it is. They could change their mind and give one out for free if they wanted to, then it would be worth less. But they won't do that because people will spend $300 on a worthless digital currency."
It was the first thing on my mind. lol
The story telling improved in 3.1 though? Are you still stuck in that sentiment just because 3.0?
 @williamsl655  Story was a snooze all the way for me.
"I did too.  The game started to feel aimless.  The 1.0 story that grabbed me was getting ignored.
Though i came back for Firefly since at least Stalleron hunters were getting traction.
But 3.0 feels like a very poorly done SPIN-OFF. lol."
 @alexfrank5331  Acheron almost made me come back because of just how insanely cool her ult anim is but it took me all about 10 seconds to remember that A. I quit after using all my pulls so I'd have to do events/grind and B. I'd just uninstall again the moment the novelty of the new character wore off
did you even watch the video
"NA isn't just a minority to CN, it's most likely a massive minority to the entire world. I say most likely because the bar chart I saw was for Genshin not Honkai but I see no reason to think Honkai is different. USA didn't even make the chart which showed the top 30 countries lol."
"Hoyo fixing Zhongli came from a time when Hoyo were run by people who care about games.
Hoyo today is a blood-sucking enterprise."
@alexfrank5331  or it could be because cn was upset so change comes lol
"Buffing units isn’t something that happens over night just because you want it too. Even less so when it’s likely they never planned to do so unit the players complained about it so…

These games are planned months in advance so they’re not going to move because people like you want them to jump when you order them too. They said buffing older units was coming so it’s coming. Even if they pushed it down a ways cause they had other things to do…

I get it, you’re entitled to your buffs but there’s a system to how these things work and they don’t need to drop everything cause you want something right nao!"
 @michaelpowers6551  that's literally how it works.  ZZZ and GI proves that. So you're just making up excuses 🤷🏻
Hoyo fixing zhong li was due to them not being multi-billon dollar company as yet and still being dependent on the playerbase.
@shonenhikada9254  what are you talking about? They made a billion their first 5 months lmao.
" @alexfrank5331  They literally only buffed Zhongli because Chinese players were upset by the fact that the god of the land representing China was not the strongest character in the game. Mind you, Hoyo makes most of their Genshin billions from the Chinese server so they had to bend the knee to stay alive."
" @crowing3886 This. CN doesn’t care much about the passive (obviously some people do, but not nearly as much over here) [other parts of Asia will also get listened too, but not as much], and since they spend way more they’re going to follow their lead. 

That’s why Nuev and Zhongli both had their issues promptly fixed."
"@JohnDoe-si4eg  yea, i didn't know CN didn't actually care much for the passive.  All hope was lost of them removing it after I found that out."
 @crowing3886  your living in a fantasy…but keep thinking life revolves around you lol…
" @crowing3886  they did not. Nicd try though Mihoyo shill.

When zhong li was released, mihoyo made millions but they hadnt reach billion dollar company as yet."
Sure....
"Mind boggling that they have actually good idea like Rappa.  Fire song for Rappa.
Then they call Rappa delusional, and while the ""real world"" lore is Dr Banana and Greek-planet."
"Bruh I could not continue the story quest and deleted the game, it was way too bad."
"Yeah the story is over convoluted, unnecessary long and it doesnt help the fact that every patch put my main char into the F tier. Every patch I am pressured to pull bc you know no amount of Gamer instinct or reflexes I have would save me when the boss one shot me during his turn."
You play a gacha and make this type of discourse?
Lol​ @KirigayaHayato 
It’s the same thing with primogems/jades or what have you. They don’t exist. Hoyo just put a price on these non-existent things and we go with it.
"Everything is only worth what people agree it’s worth 

Gold is worthless, it’s just pretty metal, but we all agree it is has value so it has value"
"@ ""Gold is worthless, it’s just pretty metal, but we all agree it is has value so it has value"" says alot about education and the lack of it."
"Uninstalled during 3.0 🫡
I was putting less and less effort into the game : I was using Acheron's technique as much as possible to one-hit kill every enemy on the map, I was using auto-mod all the time, even in the endgame...
What kept me going was the lore... but towards the end of Penacony with the fireworks, then Hoolay and Feixiao's story, not to mention Fugue who comes and goes, and that's it...
I was already disgusted with the game, but I held on, hoping for a good lore with 3.0...
I did it, IMO it was even worse, both the storytelling and the lore. I stopped and told myself I'd wait until the end of 3.x to come back, and the global passive arrived. No, I'm out, I'm still playing ZZZ because I love the game, but I'm so scared for its future...😢"
"Now that Castorice's global passive is confirmed. I'm commenting based on this current character.

I just failed to see how broken her global passive is. It might be helpful towards the newer players who don't have much characters built. But I'm thinking of the experience with Bailu at best. Getting revived just to immediately get wiped next the next enemy action.

For players who are more than ready to take on the endgame, this global passive makes no difference. How often do you have characters dying in fights especially when you have competent sustains like Aventurine and Lingsha? Once in a very while maybe?

For me, I'm skipping her even when I had prefarmed for her because I'm making my ongoing upgrade towards Acheron's E2 my priority. Even assuming I still have enough resources after achieving that, Fugue is next in line. Castorice gonna have to wait. No way I'm changing my 100% F2P status for FOMO. 

The biggest problem in HSR isn't this global passive at the moment but the pathetic amount of content that's released in every patch, even major patches now. I'm getting new characters just to pass the rite of maturity that's the endgame, then what? Return to being a farmer for majority of the time. Is that fun?

I'm still hanging on all these while because of Acheron's upgrade. It's like that annoying checkbox I can't wait to cross off in my bucket list to me... Lol. This coming rerun is the final phase. Once done, I think it's GG for me. Time to leave HSR."
"regarding thumbnail, yes its either QUIT or SUBMIT.. and yes idgaf, ill just go with the flow coz i didnt spend on this game haha"
"I uninstalled when V5 came out and it was obvious it was here to stay. the fact that there's supposedly more globals in the can for other units down the road i just can't that's as someone who's wasted upwards of 5 digits on this game I know i can't trust a game like this. you're not wrong, outside of the fei xiao segmetn of the story which was sandwhiched between two turds i haven't had fun with the game since 2.3 and even in 2.3 the story drug on in segments and felt like a slog to get through and i needed a reason to get out. especially since i've dumped way to much money into the game and this is an easy thing to make me go ""you're  whale and it's only going to get worse from here."" so i dived out."
crack and mcdonalds? crazy...
Gacha players acting like this decision will rain meteors down on earth killing us all...
"here's my thought process. 

sure yeah quit but at least leave feedback that ""hey im leaving your game because of the passive and xyz"" but if ppl leave but dont give feedback there wont be any fixes so the game will be as it is

thats like complaining about the shit the government does on social media but not reaching out to the people that could make a difference, so nothing changes"
"The moment the global pasive was official the game died to me, there Is no chance to go back and enjoy the way 1.0 felt playing every character, i  don't want to win by paying for the latest character (with time or money), it was nice while it lasted."
"I don't play HSR but what gets me is people including zzz into this when literally zzz hasn't done anything besides being under the hoyo banner and just uninstalling assuming zzz is automatically going to follow the same path. If or when zzz does follow this same path, then by all means but just judging zzz based on its older siblings without giving it a chance to prove itself is ridiculous and so far, Imo, zzz has been doing everything right. It's just crazy how various content creators that were praising zzz immediately did a 180 after this global passive situation."
"They just need to make the future global passive just like Cassie's, convenient if you have it, doesn't matter if you don't. If they started making global passives which makes a team go from 6 cycle the moc to fucking 3-4 cycle yea man that's wrap up because it will only esclate from then only. Let's see where future of hsr goes I'm f2p with not much problems clearing game and having fun so yea I'll stay for a while. 







Great video btw"
This is why I moved to Nikke.  Don't got to worry about any of this.
"Yeah, you're right. I'll keep playing, but you're right. I just want to play the game because i enjoy it regardless of the questionable choices."
"8:15 my prediction is that global passives are a way for them to make new char more enticing as hoyo is self aware that their story or marketing is not good enough for people to pull with just that 

And they are also buffing previous 5* so to make a distinction between new and old 5* 
 I want to add that if you are playing hsr for ENDGAME then just quit the game its better for you"
"You actually get Castorice for free, if you save stellar jades for 3 months. ;-) That's what F2P have to do. You can call this some kind of ""grind"" :-)"
"I was a whale 
Like i used to spend 300$ per patch 
But recently the story got way worse 
Boring bloated dialog 

The hp inflation and powercreep 

I was already tired and exhausted trying to login and play 

This global passive was just too much with all the other issues that needed fixing 

I tried giving them time to improve and fix things but i had to stop lying to myself and living in a dream 

Hoyo has no intention of improving hsr or making changes that i actually care about 

So anyway im cutting ties with hsr 
Unsubbed from their youtube and Twitter 

I have to move on"
"I think this is the first video i see with a real argument against the bad practices of HSR and not only only focusing in the global passive. its refreshing to hear that after listening to so many creators only focusing in the stupid global passive, anyways average Iyo W"
"Going to be real while I agree with just about everything in the vid, I think people should realize that Kuro games is the exception when it comes to just about 90% of gacha companies. Because you have this set of people that are jaded and realize this isn't something that can really be changed because to change it would mean to change how pretty much all gacha operate as in a complete overhaul. Hoyo is actually not only the standard as far as incentives in gacha but the model is actually rather tame compared to most gacha before genshin/covid days and so a majority of those people that have played gacha before genshin will not even see global passives as a real issue and are at least smart enough to wait till it becomes an actual issue and besides the game is still enjoyable to them before the update. Like you said ppl were just going into the livestream when they were alrdy set on quitting and wanted an excuse."
It's insane how many Hoyo bootlickers exist in the comments or on Discords and other groups. People aren't even willing to entertain the slippery slope this opens up not just for Hoyo games but every other Gatcha game out there. Run to WuWa but if Hoyo doesn't get any push back Kuro is gonna do the same shit. I've never been quite as disappointed in a subgroup of gamers than the HSR community.
F2P are on life support because I am one of them. there a famine in the game I hated so much but I just capped playing the still help
"I'm ok with this, because it's probably something related to the story.
But the moment they announce another GP, I'm out.

Doesn't matter if it will be deactivated in the Endgame or if it's ""inoffensive"". 
Global Passives are EOS. This is the only time i'll give them a pass."
"4 more global passive characters coming in just the  3.x arc.  Phainon and 3 fate colab characters so if you Hate Fate or dont want a ludonarritve dissonance break  well...(insert hoyo telling you to shove off).  will be HP+25%, +3basic atk skill, +25Spd, +CR/CD undefined. Reliable leaks from the ones showing of Castorice's"
" @SombreroGato  Ok sure. +25 SPD, An ENTIRE SPD boot as a passive lol. Did the free Ayaka from Genshin tell you that?"
 @MaximumCarnage-  hey man im just repeating what the leak said that also had the accurate Castorice info.  Don't call me crazy call the leak sus if you want.
Also leave a negative review on the game and google classroom.
you deadass?
"Yeah I mean it is what it is. Genshin came out, then after it gained traction started treating players like crap. Star rail gained traction, and are now starting to treat players like crap. ZZZ is the youngest; not even 2 years old. So...I think people understand the pattern here. It isn't fair to those specific devs for ZZZ, you right. But at the same time, it is what it is. I can't fault them if they are tired of this cycle with this company"
" @GodofGoblins  yeah I get that, it's just frustrates me. If zzz wasn't a hoyo title it would immediately be looked at differently. I'm just really hoping zzz becomes the exception to break this cycle."
"@gomeljak8899  same. I don't even play ZZZ, but I hope for the best"
" @GodofGoblins  It's not like it's hard to fix the game, they could have done it 3+ years ago and then just focused on updates instead of having to pretend that the players don't play the game. They spent more time lying and doing stupid shit than it would have taken to fix the game."
​@gomeljak8899 Hi3 is also an exception in this case. Devs actually care about the state of their game like ZZZ
"An issue is they could absolutely make it matter which is what people are dreading. If Hoyo assumes a lot of players pull Castorice, they logically will want the players to see that value right? Ok, time to jack up the damage of enemies and nuke. You think they wont? They jacked HP like crazy for a long time now. That, is what people are suspecting or dreading. And there is no shot they release globals on 5 stars that are meh or worthless. 




But time will tell. We gotta wait and see. Im just not holding my breathe because well, its Hoyo. The Star Rail team has done some great things yes, but unless these people are absolute generous saints, I think many peoples suspicions will soon come to fruition."
"Powercreep doesn't have to be limited to enemy HP.
It can also be enemy damage. :)
Imagine a boss that can ignore shield and 1-shot your DPS... unless the dps is HP-scaling or you have Cassie passive. :)"
Endgame is still getting cleared easily by F2P's who know how to play the game and don't just auto and pray..Oh and actually farm relics and lvl traces to max lol
"​ @Flare8124  lol endgame in hsr is first a char check and then skill check
And all the people u are talking about clearing content are those who have giga invested relics insane stats and had to reset 59 times for that perfect rng
All those e0 seele clears you see takes a fuck ton of retries and resetting the game 50 times is not fun
And I know I cannot convice you neither can you so lets stop now"
I expected them to finally buff Bailu with cleanse...
They new bosses have 1 shot mechanics and 1 hp depleted.
" @crowing3886  You can just bring healer against the new boss like Gallachad, Luocha, and others..."
"I’d check it out in like 6 months to see if it got better. 

Personally, I range from $0 to dolphin/whale territory, depending on my satisfaction with the story. 

So there are characters in fgo (which basically has no pity) that I will hardcore whale for and max out, but so far hsr hasn’t really gotten to the same point. 

Personally, I think they need to work a lot more on the story (and other gameplay modes) than endgame.

Don’t get me wrong that needs a fix too, but my impression is that people won’t care about that as much if everything else is good."
3.1 story is bad for you when everyone is saying it's good?
"Oh shut up, Kuro's just taking the path of least resistance. Theyre also out for your pockets just as much as the others. 😂"
" @Grayewicked  Kuro makes much less money but spends it on creating actual battle sequence. Look at Patch 2.2 quality.  Kuro takes our money to create something amazing. What has HSR been doing with our money?  For that reason, i'd rather give my money to Kuro."
" @alexfrank5331  Less or more, money is money regardless. Methods and intentions may differ, but the objectives stay the same."
"theres a difference between bootlickers and people who just don't care. Im seeing a LOT of ""I don't care"" and not a lot of bootlicking. Personally Im gonna keep playing because this really doesn't affect me. I play for fun not for the meta or any of that stuff. Just because someone may not see this as terrible as you see it, doesn't mean its bootlicking."
" @viktoryc  Very true. In fact even Gachasmack agreed with this on twitter, saying to not impose ideals on anyone else. If someone enjoys a video game, respect it. Cool, so that is to each there own. However, when someone makes valid and fair criticisms, and someone replies they are having fun and dont care, ok just be quiet bruh. We out here trying to make the game you enjoy you so much objectively better. You dont care? Neat. Enjoy and let others do there thing."
" @viktoryc  Communism affected many people who ""did not care"", they were herded into the same cattle cars as the true believers."
Oh look it’s the same ole ‘bootlicker’ comment. eyeroll I always love the people who name call and denigrate others (gachasmack comes to mind) when they don’t agree with you. It’s also a great way to never get them to listen to you…
"@michaelpowers6551  funny enough, gacha on Twitter literally said to never push someone's ideals on others in regards to this. He acknowledged that if anyone enjoys a game, respect that. Kinda odd you thought of him though. 🤔"
 @viktoryc  The problem is that you will complain about how global passives that increase crit and ignore resistance or defence ruined the game in the future.
" @thegamerfe8751  That's why we as the players need to keep giving them feedbacks in order for them to not go into that route. If you only complain but never actually giving the feedbacks to Hoyoverse directly, then what is the point?"
@ I’m not impressed by someone who says one thing in their video then another later on… so backtracked big deal…
"@ have you considered the fact that's only a possibility? I know it could very well be the case but ill be honest these ""global passives"" seem more like features that straight up stat buffs. A good example someone used in another comment is when you think about riding a bike and how there's a possibility you might fall off and get hurt, do you just choose not to ride at all? Thats what is happening in this case. For me until they show they are choosing that route I have no problem with the global passive. And if (or when) it comes to that point I honestly have no problem in pushing back against hoyo or just leaving. Imo global passives are fine as long as they are done right"
 @williamsl655 what good is feedback if they’re not gonna listen? What’s the point? Just quit the game. Simple.
" @sittingcrowd912  Then quit by your own, I love HSR and I wanted it to improve to be better"
" @williamsl655  we all want the game to improve, the problem is the devs are too complacent. Until we get CN to complain they really don’t care what us westerners say."
 @sittingcrowd912  Didn't they improved the story in 3.1? I'm sure it's not only because of CN players feedbacks. So I had hope with keep sending them feedbacks about potential backlashes that global passives will bring would made them also rethink their decision
true..well if players love a game who is on a downhill path then lets have there way...let them enjoy their final months or few year of the game
 @williamsl655  difference in opinions but what even improved in 3.1? More still images and forcing 2 characters stories into one story isn’t really an improvement.
" @sittingcrowd912  They only using black screens when it's necessary, more still images is actually fine than black screens, they were using horror-like storytelling during that Tribbie nightmare scene, the camera angles and characters expressions improved, the comedy and chemistry between Phainon and Mydei is not forced and felt more natural than 3.0, more action packed cutscenes, less puzzles during story and 2 characters stories into a story is actually fine as long as it still relevant to the lore. 

Like with understanding Mydei, we can see with succeeding Nikador's coreflame means he must also succeeding his role as Vanguard of Amphoreus against the black tide for eternity. For Tribbie, we know that even if she know that she would scattered into a thosand pieces and died eventually she is still doing so for the sake of Amphoreus future. It also noting that they only promised to do improvement of the story in 3.2, but they really fixed the storytelling in advance."
@ I guess it’s just a difference in opinions then because there’s still a lack of things that the story telling desperately needs and we just didn’t get any of that in 3.1. We still have characters standing around and talking with no expressions on their faces spamming the same poses over and over. The dialogue bloat is still one of the biggest issues as they like to make a simple plot unnecessary convoluted just to give the narrative a deeper meaning. And the trailblazers still have done nothing in the story while we keep getting force shipped with the new main waifu in the region. But maybe most of this will be solved in 3.2 hopefully.
" @sittingcrowd912  No, they don't forced the ship between Cas and Trailblazer unlike Firefly. Castorice is only happy to see Trailblazer seemed fine when they touch her during Flame Reaver first encounter, because anyone that touch her will surely die. Instead of romantic chemistry, it's more like friendship between them and it felt more natural. 3.2 might develop into something more but let's see"
"@ she’s looking like a Firefly 2.0 especially if you see leaks. Both drain their hp, both want to be a normal girl, both are cursed in a sense that they can’t always interact with people, both created major controversy within the community, both have a close relationship with trailblazer and use them in their BiS team, both have insects/bug motifs (Firefly and Butterfly), both have deadly abilities but come across as sweet and innocent, both are used by people for their incredibly abilities, etc. I could go on but it’s hard not to see her as just another Firefly. They definitely are setting her up to be the new girlfriend that everyone simps for."
 @sittingcrowd912  Probably
Leakers already confirmed more passives.
" @HadouGun  Oh yeah... don't worry, my Free Ayaka is uninstalling the HSR for me."
The only way they can fix the global buff is not let it stack atleast 2 buff should be max
it doesnt matter if its a disgrace to turn based no whats even more of a disgrace? games like wuwa and ZZZ are a disgrace to action combat ill play hsr over those games any day
"Yeah pretty much I come back do the story, play a week or two to grind jades for character, if I get em, another week to get useful then just only log on for DU/SU, Endgame and wait until next patch. That's why the passive doesn't really bother me, I barely play to begin with."
"I feel like they added the passive on to her cz they just wanted to experiment with it, test the waters if ya will. Simple as that

As for my own opinion on it: This is ganna be a hot take probably but I dont really care. I've seen other gacha's have similar buffs and it's been fine there. (FEH, Azur lane and Nikke being examples)
I get that people are scared of the potential it can bring for other passives in the future, but thats just it. Potential. 
There's also potential that you go ride a bike, you fall off and break your leg. Does that mean you should never ride a bike just because that can happen? No, you just keep on rolling.
Stressing out of something that's only a possibility is not fun and not healthy, so I'm not ganna and I'm just ganna continue enjoying the game like I have been for almost 2 years now."
I'll be whaling for the animated in game card
It’s just a game
"It could have been such an easy fix to just tell the player base ""We read your feedback, and changed the global passive talent for Casotrice. Instead, she will revive characters (maybe multiple, since Bailu already revives one character herself) while on the same team as said characters."" Or hell, just get rid of it being a global thing and change the talents effect to something else then so its not copying Bailu. They have 100% seen the huge divide from this, and of course they dont give a fuck. Once this 'harmless' passive is passed, it opens the expectation of future passives being released that will only become worse with time."
"Iyo, I’ve previously one-guyed you before on some of your past HSR takes. I stopped watching your content after you made the “Wuthering Waves needs a me” video. I came back to this vid because I am gauging all the cc’s stance on the passive. Today, I have gained newfound respect for you. You spoke nothing except facts here. Happy to hear that you’ve quit the game as well.

I am a HSR player who has spent $3k-4k on the game. I have been incredibly dissatisfied with it for a while and have quit after the Castorice announcement. I can confidently say they are going to lose a lot of dolphin level players like me who are tired of constantly pulling new units just for a fun gameplay experience. I’m afraid that won’t be enough though."
"@2:15 your take makes perfect sense. But this is a ""live service game"". People were waiting for the live service game to get better. Global passives were the harsh truth that it'll get worse instead."
"My respect for you went up ten fold....I think you just admitted a truth that even haters dont even admit. Gachasmack, pretended to like HSR and is now using this as an excuse to quit.  Out of all of the RPGs i've played in my life, HSR has always been on the lower end of the spectrum. Do I like HSR? yes, because it gives me something to do after work, and its easy to play. But as an RPG, its just mid but its a good Gacha game. Its opposite with Genshin Impact, I think Genshin is a great Open world RPG, but its a terrible Gacha Game."
"The perception of a game's health is actually extremely important to the company. If a game is perceived to be ""dying"", whether or not it actually is, becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. For casual and hardcore players alike. Whales require minnows to survive, if there's no casual playerbase to flex against, even whales will stop spending very quickly."
"Ngl a guard option in HSR (Like FGO) would be so GOOD. Or a different type of defensive function for specific paths (Guard for Preservation, Destruction, Erudition, Rememberance -> Evasion would be nihility, abundance, hunt, harmony)

Those changes + using consumables in endgame would do a lot for the game.


TLDR: I agree wh you lol"
I still maintain that the “global passive” was originally a simple coding error and the massive amount of talk it generated made it real
"I'm from the future and the global Cas revive is another ""Firefly is busted forever"""
"Agree with the whole video. And people who feel they need to quit are completely valid after all this and with the game has been headed beforehand. Although on the flip side I wish some of those people wouldn’t put down others who still enjoy the game, global passive or not. I feel like it’s okay to still enjoy the game if you do, and not get hate for it! Overall though this situation is messy and although I personally won’t quit until after the fate collab, I hope the game does get better for the dedicated players."
I would like to say something I don’t care am pulling
23:28 Shoutout to Topaz
People are using the passive as reassurance to quit something they already weren’t enjoying but in turn trying to make anyone who stays out to be “lesser” than them for doing so . They also are using the excuse that it has to be a statement made by the whole community and not a portion when that’s just not the case . If a majority of players don’t pull castorice I’m sure they’ll see they lost money and won’t do it again given how greedy they are . The issue is making not pulling Castorice the final nail that will causes the game to be “fixed “
"""It's just horse armor""
""it's just skins""
""it's just loot boxes""
""it's just battlepasses""
""it's just $600 for C1 Furina"""
"There is a time and place to know when to quit; don't let having spent time and money on this make you feel like u have a duty to stay with the game. Ok so why? right? like why do some people quit even though they can just ignore and have fun with the game. yep sure u can do that but if the game you are playing keeps just not really doing stuff and stagnating or introducing enemies that greatly incentivizes u to pay up to win Imagine right u pulled e2 Castorice surely NO WAY she feels terrible 1 year later I'm sure enemies will still be bearable by then. I love the game that's why I want the best for it but its hard when u have a lot of players just content with mediocre remedies that won't even last 3 patches later. yea mb for yapping

 TLDR: if u have something in the game u like make sure that that will be improved upon and don't settle for less."
good for you ! and what is a good action combat game for you just for fun ?
" @WetSquirrel  This is a fake social media account you are talking to my guy. Mihoyo employs millions of these to spread propaganda, promote people to spend and slander their competitors."
U absolute creature. I wish u luck on ur pulls
Thank you 😝 I'm excited
"I have seen CN reviews and them 
most of  really don't give a fk so yea thinking it will get removed in future is just not possible plus they made whole ui for just to use 1global passive? I doubt it"
 @Hollowgunner  Chinese players have no standards. MHY being one of the biggest Chinese companies shows how China treats anyone not Chinese. Hard to believe people keep trying to trust China when they shortchange everyone.
"Nope they can’t do that. Once something goes live, they can’t nerf it. And we’ve long since passed the balancing stage, so it’s too late now."
He didn't quit the game
 @piscye1806 22:38 he hasn’t been playing and he is waiting for hoyo to fix them. He isn’t playing the game lol.
" @KenPicaro  I dont have any way to spend thousands on the game but I did spend a considerable amount and decided to quit too. Iyo is spot on about the game in general moving in the wrong direction for a while now. If I cannot use the characters I like in a game that is almost entirely about combat, then what is the point"
"3-4k Dollars is a dolphin nowadays :D ?
Thats just how out of touch many gacha players seem to be.
Other than that i respect your decision. I have a lot of issues with HSR aswell but i guess i will wait for the ""buffs"" in 3.4. However this game, for a while now, wont get any money from me."
" @KenPicaro He pseudo quit. As in he comes in and out, mostly to do character guides and other associated things (just check out previous videos lol) and then quits again. 

So he just doesn’t actively plays the game, but still makes content about it."
"@tony-.-4766 I don't know the exact definition, maybe I'm wrong on that part. But I have seen people who have spent half of what I have call themselves 'dolphins' so I went with it. If I am not a dolphin, that's fine, it doesn't change the fact that I've spent 3-4k in the game."
"@KenPicaro  I didnt want to make fun of you, dont get that wrong, but i feel like people in the gacha community are kinda out of Touch what a reasonable amount of Money is too spend on a game. Most of people that call themselves gamers and play a lot of Games for years probably did not spend 3k Dollars on all their Games in total.

Consider what amount of money a company like larian studios got before they developed Divinity2 and Baldurs Gate and those games are so much better and complex. With the Money people spend on gacha it should be easy for hoyo to add a skip button, add more game modes, add more cut scenes and so on.
Although i think its fine people spending Money on a game since its their Hobby, Just compare what you can get with that Money.

Some years ago i traveled the world with 3500 Euros with 6 Destinations with the Likes of Japan, Australia, united states etc. I didnot live in luxury hotel obviously, but it was life changing adventure i will look still look back at it 20-30 years.

If it comes too me ( and i myself also spend more than enough Money on Games) everything above 200 Dollars is already pretty much."
" @tony-.-4766  Actually I thought you said the exact opposite, I thought what you meant was 'imagine calling yourself a dolphin when you've ONLY spent 3-4k on gacha' 😂 My bad bro you're good. I agree, even 200 is already a lot.
Also, I do own a lot of games for my xbox and ps5, a lot of them were on sale when I got them. The actual value of those combined would also be probably the same. Scary when you think about it."
 @milmil5350  hope he sees and understands this
A field with only a few giant tree's is not a forest despite what anyone says.
Genshin has been called a dying game for years and hoyo did nothing
It's nowhere near dying ​ @shadow-faye 
"theoretically this is true, but practically it isn't becoz every single game that has been running a few years or more will be called ""dead"" by community or the internet...I have been playing many old games for years, for gacha games like granblue, fgo, mihoyo games, to pvp games like lol apex r6, and all games after released a few years, there will be so many ppl in the community & internet constantly claiming them to be dead while they have been running fine for years"
F2p players are really important for playerbase count.If a lot of f2p and casual players quit it will give a bad reputation to the company.Whales are for the company profits and f2p players are to give a good reputation to the company whether the company are friendly consumer or not
Maybe that'll be Phainon's global passive.
I mean it ain't wrong
Firefly still is though.
"She still is if the enemies enemy calls for a fire DPS, there's no good Fire DPS at the moment so that'll change when another Fire DPS comes out"
"Firefly is shadow-nerfed by increasing enemy HP. It's offense power-creep
Castorice is a defense-powercreep.  They can keep increasing enemy damage.  Enemy does special power attack that ignore Aventurine shield and 1-shot your dps unless you have Castorice passive. :P"
They're enablers of the abuse. Complicit.
RIP My Topaz after Cipher comes out. :(
Its just a game
It only gets worse. This only sets the stage for what's to come.
"""its just a $200 league skin"""
" @Blacknight6577  when you're not 13, you'll realize how dumb this argument is."
A lot of HSR characters require E2 S1 to function.
"The issue is, no one's forcing you to commit to these purchases."
@Grayewicked  so that means any game can be as P2W as possible because you're not partaking in them
@Danny-mp8dq  you're acting as if you can't actively resist whatever life throws at you. Pathetic defeatist mentality.
 @HadouGun  that's a bold claim
Why is bro bringing Furina in this? C0 she's still top 2 in the game
" @Blacknight6577  and 300$ is not a lot of money, is it?"
 @hoanganhvuong5430  and who made that choice?
" @Blacknight6577  def not me, but those under 16 might. And before you said anything about ""parent's fault for not control their kid spending on a gacha game""; because they are kids. Are you able to control them not watch porn or slasher movies at all? There are regulations banning them from watching those: pg18. And guess what the age rating for HSR is?  It's 12+. Kids are allow to play these games, that's the problem. And global passive only makes it worse"
"@ I wasn’t going to say that cus I agree on that as someone who’s been playing games for almost 30 years and have lived a childhood of my own. So yes I’m aware kids can do things behind parent’s back. However, what the parents can control is them having access to their bank account."
"Notice how none of the things you mention have any impact on your enjoyment of a game (except maybe battle passes keeping you playing, which usually come with a free track anyway)"
Welcome to Gatcha games. It’s been like this since 2010.
 @Danny-mp8dq pay to win? What are you winning?
"Not a f2p but gonna defend them a bit here.

A f2p players is a p2w player waiting to happen. Gacha games are predatory because they try every trick in the book to get the conversion from f2p to p2w.

Oh the content is time consuming well you can pay to finish faster.
Oh you want both characters this patch well if you pay you can get them. Ah you lost the 50/50 well pay more.

The whole f2p dont matter to a company is not completely true. 
F2p players being able to clear all content is good advertisement for new players to come in. 
The new players get hit by fomo or time wasting and potentially become whales.

If you spend once you’re likely to spend again and especially hoyo is going above and beyond to get you to spend once.
Yes a whale brings in the revenue but that is not the whole picture.

Also free characters are great but getting a character that everybody told you to get and has a power crept bis team, is not great. The other character is one that is power crept and everybody told you to skip.
Feels really bad"
Casterice global passive had to much glue
"Atleast the other companies know how much the player hate it, so surely they won't implement global passives on their games right...? 😀"
I believe there is a road for HSR to become better but that's up to the devs to go down that road.
I think I've been slowly falling out of love with the game since Penacony and it's primarily because of the storytelling and a lot of other stuff. I've not been struggling much with endgame content but I will say at least with MoC that it did feel a bit more difficult to get the clears I was looking for than it did before. Didn't care much for Amphoreus at least at the start but I felt like the storytelling with this most recent update was improving again and while the global passive isn't exactly the nail in the coffin for me it sucks that it feels like they improve in 1 way and then announce how they plan to fuck up harder somewhere else in the future and it feels like its all happening so fast.
"Iyo man I have watched you since the beginning of HSR. I am on the side that as long as I am having fun playing the game that is all that matters to me. I am sorry that sounds bad but that is my time, my money, and my fun. Take care man I am going to un-sub. There are no other games that you play that I follow. Take care and thanks for all the fish!"
"10:52 I have 2 exemples in genshin impact :
- The buffs to one of the shielders that was weak on release,
- Neuvillette ""bug"" fix, they apologize and gave 300 gem if I remember correctly

I do agree on somethings with you about the passive. The question is indeed ""Why ?"", why the passive is global, why are you doing this, why now, etc. ? 

About the F2P vs P2W... Companies, in general, will turn to those who benefits them. F2P don""t matter cause they are players yes, but not those who make the company's benefice. I don't mean it like F2P are shit. Just trying to be as factual as possible 

Personnaly, I don't care about the passive in itself. The thing is indeed it could lead to something disastrous... As it could lead to nothing or something else. I am in a state of ""wait and see"". I think it's too early to put a hard verdict right now. Maybe I am coping and what I say will age like milk, maybe not and time will tell if I was right or wrong. 

Either way, they wanted this passive to be implemented. It is submit or die (Mydei is that you ?). For now, I'm happy with the game, I still have my fun, I still like the story. I like the endgame (want more but I like it the way it is). I like it. However something important I want to say : Don't play a game you don't find fun in. There is thousands of other games for you to enjoy, waiting for you to play them."
"Hard for me to even log in. Ive found and played other games that have my interest and im having fun with. Wuwa, gfl2, rev1999. Sadly it doesnt bother me either. Day 1 player. Haven't decided if its worth my time or even if i have fun playing it anymore"
"Crazy that the only taunt character is FMC. After that I thought we would be introduced to more mechanics such as the ones iyo mentioned but it just seems like ""you attack, I attack"" in different forms but essentially it's all the same thing"
your videos are incoherent lmao. really should try to script a little more
"The global passive release was confirmation that hoyo only care about profit and have 0 interest in creating and cultivating a good game. Each game is a pump and dump, sell the speculation of what the game could be and milk everyone dry then repeat the cycle."
7:43 Dawg we're def getting a revived Hoolay Pro Max that'll one shot everyone
We need MORE global passives 😁
Iyo spamming uploads ayo
"Or take the third option, ignore and play the game your way, LOL."
"Well, maybe play Limbus Company, then?"
2:30 they wanted there decision of quitting to be validated by other people so they feel less bad about the wasted time or money put into the game
"Perma F2P players don’t matter, but the F2P experience does, because that’s how the vast majority of players are going to be introduced to your game."
I am f2p all the time for any games I played.
"F2p matters tho because they are the players base of the game, most of the players are f2p, if the players base is low no will spend money on the game which they think doesn't have a player base simple logic, why do they give free characters for f2p players who else ?"
Dev will change it if they losing profit from China players otherwise no shot.
"Appreciate that man. And you know what, your time, money, and fun are yours to use how you see fit. More power to ya, big dawg!"
Genshin gave out 1600 for it.
@jamesdavid2893  oh ok mb then ! I had a doubt. Thanks m8 !!
​@Paradox666-66 no problem.
Preach! Wish players who are quitting or have already wouldn’t put down those who still enjoy the game though. The amount of people i’ve seen trying to morally grandstand by putting down players who want to pull for Castorice is ridiculous.
"You can see how Neuvillette affected Astra with her new Hollow Zero attack form, you can hardly even aim her beam it's crazy bad."
"I also still haven't quit the game because it's still not as bad now, but I  bet that they will monetize this global passive aggressively in the future, along with more powercreep and restrictive characters and LCs. 

I don't mind if people play and have fun with the game, but at least they acknowledge the blatant monetization and accept others criticisms. If you still enjoy it then play it, and if you don't quit, I can understand both sides if they are being reasonable, let's not attack each other"
"Yunli has it with ult 
Mydei has it with ult also"
"@Quizzer2016  fair enough but my point was having more mechanics like guard (similar to argenti boss or traffic robot), chances of missed attacks, hide (only more has this atm) etc etc so you kinda missed the point and only commented to be correct"
"@yassassintm4234 For a “turn based” game, I’m disappointed HSR doesn’t have an evade/miss attack chance mechanic for characters/enemies, it’ll be annoying as hell with enemies but imagine running a sustainless dps just because they can evade attacks lmao"
 @Oyogitsune  unfortunate thing they had considered a dodge mechanic in the past
Boothill taunts
"u trippin, my tingyun taunts better than mc"
" @donkey44-n4q  tingyun  aggro goes even beyond the game itself, did you ever wonder where the shots go, in other games, when enemies miss? To tingyun."
@yassassintm4234 More RNG on the game would probably not be welcomed by many if they balance the game around those extra RNG checks
"​ @Oyogitsune  nah then what reason would be to pull sustains for?
However a dodge mechanics would be really cool on a Preservation unit"
"I literally said ""it's not gonna be edited, I'm just gonna talk."" lol I'm not scripting out brain thoughts."
They're an incredibly abusive company to it's playerbase. Predatory. Abusive.
"Most of their profit are from China players, what do you expected."
"​@sweeleongng333 Incorrect, Japan spends more than china in almost all of their games"
@PabloRodriguezreal In total? China wins all day everyday that's why they only care for China's opinion for buffs and stuff the amount of value China gives them also being their home market is nuts. Japanese spend lots ofc but not more than China
"Not just profits…. short term profits at the expense of long term sustainability. No competent gacha developer would’ve let a feature like weakness implant pass beta, because it breaks one of the fundamental principals of gacha design. Like seriously, the damage type system present in basically every gacha game with a combat system doesn’t exist for the player’s benefit, it exists so that the developers can sell you more characters. Creating a character that bypasses the element types is just stealing from your own future profits."
"@nickjordan8996 its like what josh hayes said when he reviewed genshin, yes the monetisation isn’t in your face, f2p viability is a thing, But its the most carefully crafted manipulative  version of monetisation and it ends up getting allot more money in the long run. 

All this does is compounds the issue, they created."
Why? They already have characters that do this with them in the team. Would you say the game is impossible to beat without them in it now?
"""Short term profits"" is a crazy statement. HI3 is still running barely profitingif at all, Genshin still rakes in a good amount 5 years in, HSR is still only a little behind Genshin. ZZZ is the one with the best QoL and effort put in, yet it's sadly seems to be the one lagging behind a bit.

If there's one thing about HoYo's games, it's longevity. The only pump-n-dump schemes that are somewhat valid are Anni patches, as they seem to lock power spikes behind C2 for the new units. HSR's spending event is disgusting though, cause they could have easily made it tied to Stellar Jades like HI3 so F2P and those who saved up are rewarded too"
noo we arent and your dooming if you think we will
​ @Zoeila erm... that was only a joke
"Nah, I just needed them to drop in the same day cause I yap A LOT. LOL"
so basically the second option
sooo the 2nd option?
Bro thought he was cooking by just saying the second option but different
" @amari7782  You're actually dumb as a box of rocks. Playing however you want isn't ""submitting"" to the company; you're just a dunce. And I'm F2P, and Hoyoverse games only get 5 minutes a day from me, LOL."
Reverse 1999 feels like the best alternative tbh
I finally started playing Limbus Company and the story is better than expected. Even better than the garbage HSR is putting out now… and less annoying t&a on its characters lol…
"Yeah, one reason I stay F2P on most gacha is if I leave, I lose nothing but the time I spent on a game, and I can always come back."
"U can also say this ""They wanted their decision to stay to be validated by other people so they feel like the time and money they spent on the game was worth it."" There is a time and place to know when to quit; don't let having spent time and money on this make you feel like u have a duty to stay with the game."
 @ChipSilNight  your response has nothing to do about waht i said besides YOUR ego i was giving a reason why people are leaving with others in response to what iyo what talking about you came to YAP about leaving
Or they hoped that 3.2 you know the anniversary patch might be the start of a turnaround for the shoddy state of the game and that the leaks of the global passive would be bs but it wasnt so 3.2 was the straw that broke the camels back.
pandoras box is not that bad what the Greek gods says
Lets goooo gotcha whales only club monetization mechanics.... alright everyone all together...baarrffff
"its funny how e2 fu xuan isnt brought up, especially now that it is very attainable"
saying new people wont have castorice at all. in what logic wouldnt they do. i mean srsly did u forget ALL old events can be farmed shít tons of jade. so atleast they would get 1 copy.  yeah sure u might say also they wont be able to farm and lvl them up. but well they will becouse some patches ago they added that even if u not unlocked the zone with story u will have access to farm those mats. so yeah just pointing that out
"2:16 , they will, play alot ? reroll ? who cares about flexibility if thats what they want ?"
1hp revive is no big deal honestly so I don't see what all the fuss is about.
E
Why does bro sounded like he's beating it 😭
"Being honest here, I am on the side of Tectone here. I believe this system could have been better implemented and sucks that HOYO decided to choose the most GREEDY FUCKIN ROUTE POSSIBLE. I made the video to provide hope for players who are actively being so doom and gloom on the topic. The video is a ton of coping if im being 100% real with you all. You would have definietly realized if he had finished the video. Anyway, Thanks for the Reaction and I hope you all have a good rest of your days."
"What people don’t get (or deliberately not getting) about the whole Castorice thing isn’t her global passive, but it’s the PRECENDENCE of her having a global passive for the future of the game lmao. 

Just wait until we get a global passive that provides increased Crit Rate/DMG to your units or smth 😂"
"The problem with how this issue is being addressed in twofold, both on the company AND the community: on one hand, the company is pushing out the Global Passive attached to pulling Castorice, rather than gaining it by completing her story (which would make FAR more sense in lore and gameplay-wise), which is a scummy move on their part. However, the reaction from the community is VASTLY overblown, and instead of just protesting by using their voices and their wallets, the players who are protesting are ALSO villainizing a vast number of other players who don't have a problem with it, and want to pull Castorice and play the game for their own personal enjoyment. The issue is coming in where, even as someone who doesn't like the implementation of the Global Passive, I've completely switched sides to not caring anymore, because the loudest voices that are calling for it's removal are ALSO claiming some insane moral highground... over a gacha game, an innately predatory genre built on the foundation of spending money for power.

If you want to protest predatory business practices, then I have news for you: quit Gacha games altogether. Everyone who is standing on their high horse and calling out the Global Passive, but still playing other Gacha Games, is by definition a hypocrite, because EVERY gacha game is designed to entice you to spend money in the same capacity. Don't throw stones from Glass Houses, it makes you look like a moron. 

Worst of all, HSR is a single player game, where you can get 90% of the rewards in the end-game modes just by having two brain cells to rub together, and spending the free currency you get, and that isn't even the bulk of the currency you'll earn! The majority of the currency earned in the game is JUST. BY. PLAYING. FREE. TO. PLAY. Those last 3 Stars in MoC are only worth 80 gems, and it would literally take you a year and a half to garner enough gems from clearing 12/12 or 36/36 to get to even a single pity. That's how little it truly matters. There's no PvP, and absolutely NO content in the game that would pit your teams against someone else's, so having Global Passives or not will NOT make you account worse in comparison unless YOU ARE COMPARING IT YOURSELF, which isn't an issue the game is creating, it's an issue YOU are creating for YOURSELF. 

Listen: Global Passive or not, it's a goddamn game, that people are playing for fun. If you AREN'T having fun, for the love of GOD, just take a break from the game, or quit altogether. Don't make it everyone else's problem, especially people who are still having fun with the game, and do NOT act like you're somehow morally superior for having done so if you're jumping ship to play ANOTHER. GODDAMN. GACHA GAME."
This helped no need hope further
I just want to say that new players will be able to get castorice because they can farm alot of jades from the story and permanent content
bro need an inhaler or something......
This would be Jenezad in another universe with SPECIAL needs
"Since they can't defend this BS, they wanna drag others along with it - like Cantarella's swimming mechanics.

It's absolutely insane..."
lets be real aint no way a multibillion dollar company doesnt have a guy or team that dev check this without thinking aint this a stupid or retarted way of implementing it
yall dragging this to insane lengths now lol
I love how his counter argument is to bring Bailu into the picture 😂😂😂😂. Brah baliu could revive 4 times in a battle and she’d still be bad. Baliu isn’t bad cause she can’t revive more baliu is bad cause our sustains now are also partly harmony characters and she provides either 0 buffs or very little buffs as well no cleanse or giving effect res. Hope this helps 😊
I have not heard anyone else talk about it but pulling castorice incentives you to not actually build or use the unit at all... which is stupid. If you run castorice in your main team you get to have a 4 man squad. If you run a team with out her now you get a 5 man squad..... (technically since you now have a extra passive revived). It seems like to get a maximum value from the unit you just don't want to even run them because I get to run a entire extra unit now. Such a stupid unit to add to the game. Also them giving you free supports is great and all for new players and getting a castorice when you start the game is also cool but now if you decide to get into the game after this patch you will be at a infinitely worse starting point then anyone else.... why would you even start playing at that point.
Imagine crying over cantrella swimming when you have free wings to fly on 😂 and the fact they actually hinting giving us new traversal tech in huanglong😂 funny
Can't believe people are actually loosing their absolute shit over a mid passive.... Like Acherons technique is much more OP than this. Revives you once per battle ye? Pixel hp? Bruh people need to touch grass like srsly.
Hope this helps ..Corinna gave tec a new outro phrase
"Dude literally sounds like a mouthbreather too, you cant make this up"
"disability ❌
dis ability ✅"
"I built bailu, but the reason is because I don't have any other healers."
"I feel like ppl are forgetting castorices passive is global meaning u dont even have to run healers and just yolo, incase u do run a healer u can even run natasha since that passive will carry all old units"
"@8:28 Yeah, because this guy sucks at speaking, lol."
"There’s ways to do global passives and there’s ways not to

The way HSR did it is horrendous made worse by the fact that HSR has terrible balancing when it comes to power creep"
The other problem with the Bailu logic is you still need to have a Bailu... I've been playing since day one and I've never pulled a Bailu. Also I chose Bronya as my free standard banner character cuz I also never pulled Bronya lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅I never 👎 played HSR since launch 🚀 hoyo games need to go  in the trash 🗑️ 😂😂😂😂
Do I even get her or no? Cuz I’m guaranteed since I lost the 50/50 to what’s his name I can’t remember how to spell it 😭 anyway do I get her or save for someone else? 😢
at what point did it ever get this serious? lmao its literally not that serious bro😂😂😂who gives af fr like actually…mfs acting like the worlds about to end or some shit
I still remember when i first found tectone. I was trying Ulala and looked up some vids on it to know if I'd actually like playing it long term. Been here ever since. Im happy i stayed.
"7:14 fair point KINDA cos WHY couldn’t her passive just be that she can multi res if she’s on the team, that’s it, or just give everyone the global passive when she INEVITABLY joins the ship like every character does wether you pull them or not and give cass a regular passive idk what it would be but for instance I don’t have jing yuan yet I can talk to him on the ship cos I finished his character quest. These characters join the express wether you pull em or not ffs"
actual mouth breather
Not that bad is still bad.
you cant even compare that to Bailu because ASSTORICE IS NOT EVEN A DAMN HEALER
There are actually gacha games out there that give you a permanent buff if you have a spefific kind of group or characters on your Account. But not on this AAA level I think.
"Good for all of us, Teccy uses ""Hope this helps"" as video outro. How to hit karens and morons, at the same time."
would be funny if Hoyo put Enemys into the Game casting a Debuff that prevents your Characters from resurrection 😂 (RIP Castorice)
It’s because their doom posting and saying everyone is going to have a GP when that isn’t even confirmed or proven besides people saying leaks and then not showing the proof of said leak. It’s one big “trust me bro”
"When Netherwing disappears, deals 6 instance(s) of DMG, with each instance dealing Quantum DMG equal to 40% of Castorice's Max HP to one random enemy. At the same time, restores HP by an amount equal to 6% of Castorice's Max HP plus 800 for all allies."
@ good for you and your castorise sustainer build then lololol
@ She heals and you are cooked.
 @navalhabr  the only thing that’s cooked is your intellectual capability
 @navalhabr  btw I’m sure your dps bailu build can also do 1m dmg alongside healing
@ I'm fine. You are the one assuming things about my builds. Take your medicine bruh.
" @navalhabr  thanks, I’d rather leave the meds for someone who actually really needs them
you, for example"
" @navalhabr  ohhoohhh anywayyy I just checked your comment history and turns out you’re one of the dawei’s 100th yacht and wallet fanatics-defenders lmao
argument automatically dismissed there’s nothing to discuss with ya"
"@ So you really have the meds? Holy s... 

(omg, cooked again)."
Baldtone's new nickname should be Discount Saitama cause he has a massive hero complex.
P2W dead game
Hey guys. Just a reminder tml is the release of Castorice. Whoever cc pull for her is a immoral and evil person destroying the game and promoting gambling to their audience. Make sure we go in and destroy their chars. These ppl do not deserve ana audience for promoting gambling.
"I disagree with the position that Castorice is ""the end"". I just started a new account and it's a fact that the difference of an accounts strength if it has Therta and doesn't have it is major, same with Robin, Ruan Mei, Tribbie or any other SS tier character.. The account's strength completely changes with 1 single character. The ""not havers"" are already being beat down by the power creep, and Castorice itself isn't anything different than just a SS tier character with some additional functions. 
For comparison, I also had an old EU account with old S tier characters - and that account is a complete joke even though it has numerous (former) S tier characters which are now trash and struggle with clearing Penacony's normal enemies (unless i run a dedicated heal + tank). My new account is in Asia and that account has a Yunli + Tribbie + Gallagher with Himeko/Herta and I smashed through everything with that account. If you already have Therta, or can 1 shot content, this will not change anything about that account. It just reduces the chance of your character getting 1 shot due to bad luck. 

Now the issues with global passives start when you start getting ""20% Break efficiency"" type of passives, but even then it doesn't really matter to new accounts or casuals, this literally only affects the min-maxxers. Even without Castorice, we will see accounts getting through MOC without an issue & for me I don't see it as anything different from just part of the powercreep. I really don't understand why Teccy is freaking out, while it's indicating a negative direction for the game, it's literally no different from just snowballing through content with Therta or any other SS tier main DPS in your team.

So in summary: Things are already bad in terms of the power creep so that the power level of accounts is vastly different, so at this point I think all players should just stop being hardcore invested in the game and just play it for what it is - a single player game where you can gamble for characters. The newest story is also kinda weak, so instead of Castorice being the end of HSR, the writing team will kill the game first."
Summoners war did it really well for that global passive thing which was really amazing :D
BALDMAN QUICK a nuisance streamer vitaly has been prosecuted in the Philippines and will now be put in Prison.
what if i love global passive because it makes everything stronger
"Global passive baldman, nah i will skipping baldness"
Tectone you are the most worse gacha content creator. Your baldness literally destroyed the friendship and started a meaningless war among fandom.
"""the dislike ratio of the video will be in the thumbnail"" except it's an exaggerated one, oh nice. Thanks for being clear about it."
"I Hope WuWa add global passive in game to Rover yes ""ROVER"", All Player have him and it's FREE. why u ask? well this is KURO :)"
"Tec, can you not fathom the idea that other people come to the same conclusion as you without watching your video?"
"The craziest thing I still see regarding this is that end game players currently think her passive is even going to show up for them.  Her passive will literally only help people struggling with content.  Who the fuck is wiping at MOC 12 and was thinking ""Man, wish I had one more revive, I really had them on their last leg!""  No, you aren't failing content in cycles because of death, its because of lack of damage.

Not saying the global idea is good or anything just, specifically talking about the usefulness of this passive.  Even if it wasn't Global it would still be ass.  Unless of course they start shaping their content around it which, would be stupid as hell considering new players after twenty days won't have access to her.  We shall see."
"Castorice is GOATed and Tectone is bald. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
Hope this helps from Teccy gets me every time lmao
"What they should do is give global passives in some way for players,who didn't pull for the character. I wish they would listen to us cause if they  
did listen to us, things would be so much different."
Bro probably thought people were complaining because it wasn't powerful enough. he missed the whole point lol.
"Funny thing is, the passive is only really useful during the early  game. Your problem during late game isn't really getting one-shot, but dealing enough damage. If you die during late game, your team or relics just suck - that's all. Aside from the fact, that it revives you at 1% HP, which doesn't stop your enemy from doing you in during their next turn.

People didn't cry this much when Acheron was released - the character can literally skip battles 😂"
"I just can’t comprehend why Hoyo thinks these blatant predatory practices (PP for short), are good for the game or their reputation in the long run."
ALL ROADS LEAD TO TECTONE 😔
"Another moronic fool who doesn't understand the real problem here, holy hell."
If they somehow made acherons auto kill a global passive aka a second technique on all characters maybe something woulda happened but most ccs atp seemed like they wanted an out with the game. They going with the idea that 3 more global passives are coming when it was a fake leak being presented as real. Disengenousness masquerading as a movement. Her global passive is just the anniversary premium treatment and nothing more.
"One of the few sane comments here.

Yes, the passive itself is purz garbage for endgame players. 

The only mere impact it could have is to make sustainless teams more accessible to bad players.

However, Castorice own mecanic actively wants a healer to gain HP after she lost so she can deal her damage.

And yes, nobody cried about Acheron. While, I personally felt bad having to farm longer bcs I skipped this dumbass bitch Raiden Mei, and my fuckin casual friends spent 5m chrono in SU, while I took 10 with great teams 😂"
"who really dies in this game, the game is easy. it is not that bad lol. this is why it is boring bc you step in, can you stop being a killjoy"
How much you wanna bet tectone isn't gonna quit the game like he said he was? Bet he'll come up with some kind of excuse to work around it
bro choking on air comment got me
"Castorice 2.0 in patch 4.X now her passive revive all your characters with 100% HP and you dont have do heal or shield them,because reasons"
Look y'all the last 5* I have is Aventurine and i pulled him on his rerun. I stopped playing and only logged in again for the free Bronya. I'm not playing that much. Just the thought of having to go through the story to get primogems and most events feel like chores. I really like Castorice's Animations. But It doesn't feel worth it to hop back in the game when I don't have any new characters that came after Penacony. Progression is stale and i really don't see myself spending months trying to get one piece of artefact
"people is so stupid that they cant get the problem is not the current GP mechanic,but the one coming after this.......the GP system itself"
"Something I haven't seen anybody say (on either side) is how not-really-insignificant the passive is. Defenders say ""oh but the passive effect is tiny"", where reasonable people say ""this one is whatever, but it opens the floodgates"".

But when I thought about it, it's almost comically evil how subtly ""significant"" the passive is. When you just look at the effect, you think that ""eh, it's whatever"". But then consider every time you had a moment, where you're into your 4th/5th cycle (or even more if you're on a worse side), at least 5 minutes, or just a mode where you're almost at the goal. Any mess up means lost run. And then suddenly, all enemies decide to jump at one ally (Tingyun) and nuke that character out of existence while you can't do anything about it (no ults, not close enough to break enemies in time, no emergency heals). And then, that death causes you to restart, as you no longer have the damage to fit in time. 

In the past, you'd be frustrated, but you would know that it's just bad RNG, there wasn't much you could have done. But now, you will know in the back of your head, that if only you had Castorice, this bad RNG moment wouldn't have happened."
Tbh i dont care about any of this. I am f2p and i will pull for castorice because i like her design and she has a dragon. Does this make me bad aswell?
"I like her.
Gonna pull her with 117 tickets saved.
Reason: she looks pretty and another waifu to add."
"I personally think ANYONE who cares positive or negative over a worthless mobile gacha temp passive needs a life re-eval. I'd like a REAL explaination why you for REAL think this matters lol. Not for view farming, hopping on the dick of a content creator like a simp or ""joining the crowd"" like some cuck. Humans do this stupid shit all through history. ""I'm gonna say this race is bad because all my friends do"", ""I'm gonna follow this dictator because it's for MY country"", ""I'm gonna be a libtard, dye my hair blue and say all billionaires are nazi's and burn cars because others are doing it."", and I feel like those that just do NOT give a fucking shit about these pussy Chinese mobile preds just play the fucking game and shut the fuck up,not whine and bitch and moan like the pansy pussies you were raised as, the soft weak willed sheep recent generations create and follow. Anyone caring AT ALL of any videogame mechanic or aspect is actually sad."
"Ok, but tell my why HARMONY and PRESERVATION characters exist.. whats their sole purpose for the party. How come a Main Dps Character have a revive passive. How come bailu have one. What the hell even is Harmony and Preservation character at this point. Imagine not needing one of them because a global passive just gives you survivability."
Dude was out of breath the entire Video. He's got bigger problems than a gacha
Me still using Bailu and keep doin fine 😂
"As long as the community spenders don't give a F, ME, as a F2p also don't give a F. These spenders keep me playing for FREE..😂

So just go and spend guys, we're cheering for you..🎉"
"the tower and pillars things you said, i like that that would've been so much better than locking them into a character."
Tectone shutting up is even cooler
strange guy
Hope this helps🙂😁😁😁😁
"Tbh I feel like Acheron is worse then castorice and nobody was talking about it on her release😅

""If u don't have Acheron then you'll waste your time fighting random shi you don't wanna fight"""
"Guys how about we leave it at criticising the points he brought up and not personally attack him for his breathing or way of talking. 
Thats so below what you should be. 

He may have a bad take about the situation, but no need to unnecessarily make a joke out of him."
It's not about her passive's strength it's about the fact they're going to add more and more of these which becomes more and more useful. If you don't pull the character with the passive ur account is fundamentally worse because of that.
Why wouldn't he? He quit genshin
"@SoilKilonova cuz he still talks about it every day, has a podcast talking about it, makes 90% of his content relating to it, etc"
 @SoilKilonova how many times did he quit genshin though only to come back anyway and give the company even more money
EXACTLY.
"Yes and no. IF multiple enemies target that one character and they die from the first attack, they will revive but the other enemies in sequence will immediately kill your revived character again. This is also true for multi-turn characters such as Hoolay, BanaKademics, the Automaton, and flame-reaver. I've been playing castorice myself all day and the revive has only actually helped me once. My Pela died vs Aventurine, revived, hit the dice and then immediately died the next turn. It allowed my Acheron to clear the APOC without resetting, but since Pela died it significantly slowed down my run. For someone new, I can see how getting any amount of stars would have been satisfactory, but as someone who has been playing for some time, it still meant I needed to redo the floor."
"@thecalmbeforethemaelstrom  I see. Yeah, of course it's up to RNG - you may encounter such a situation where it won't save you, you may even be lucky and not get such a scenario at all, but you might also have a situation where it impacts the performance and is enough to give you a clear. I think it can matter especially when you don't have the best possible team for a specific archetype or boss - I remember struggling very badly against last apoc's quantum bug, and had a few times where I died while being really close to finishing him off in time (especially with Yunli). And as you're saying, it also helped you get a clear, which yeah, can be enough for someone newer or playing less, especially with some endgames getting harder, longer and more frustrating over time. 

And with how many characters the game is releasing, without being very lucky you just can't get all of them, especially if you started later. And of course, it can matter more if they decide to give bosses more damage and specific mechanics that punish not having certain characters, which I guess we will only see in the future (although if I recall correctly, I saw some people complaining about recent MoC rotations being noticeably harder in that aspect)."
No he has already said if u don't care about improving the game then he doesn't care
No if you like something from this game that gives you enjoyment don’t let others shame you because it’s your decision that matters to you alone at the end of the day.
The reason why is because they liked the game back then so they let it slide. She also was the start of light cones becoming op and feeling part of the characters kit then couple patches later we get yunli whos way worse without it.
"It's tectone community, there assholes at heart so they don't care"
"You know, it would be pretty funny if they release a character that gets a benefit from resurrecting."
Not even a minute in and bros comparing being a hypocrite to being racist
3 more days til my queen comes home!
reason why the dude still only have 300 or so subs. Probably his alt accounts
"Do you have to spend money for her? Just play the game and they gave soo many jades from events and all sorts of contents in the game and they gave enough time to farm before her banner ended. I'm f2p so i know the situation.

Stop spending like a crazy gambler if you do not get her, be patient and farm again if you really want her. If you do not want her, then f*ck off."
"Newer Players can have cas, because you get Up to 146 pulls in the anniversary Patch according to some YouTubers who calculated the stellar Jade amount in this Patch."
They could be planning to add a insta kill mechanic on bosses later down the line and will make you regret not pulling for castorice
"HSR is cooked well done. Global passive​s will eventually get strong​er to the point that get better than some supports and substains. And Heat Death might happen due to powercreep via global passives.





BRUH🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿"
new players get more than enough currency in the span of 2 weeks to gurantee a 5 star so definately they can get cas.
Why is the revive permanent. Could of been like just 1 extra rotation before you die again that way f2p can get that tiny boost to beat the new 50 castoricillion hp boss
I do not understand how people are having this much trouble to comprehend how this is simply a bad thing that will only fuck over the players
this guys sounds like he's running on a treadmill for 3 hours and decided to record a video at the same time.
"It you think about it Castorice's global passive and Tectone's bald head are similar, they are both world wide effective"
"It's not bad, but it's also a must pull for everyone with an active account 😂😂"
Super cringe when I see PPL defend this 😂😂😂😂
"I thought this would be another clickbait video and baldtone would just be playing wizardry, but I am pleasantly surprised."
"People copin' because they want to stay playing HSR. That's fine.



Edit: Actually, it's not fine since the game will get worse and these people settling for mediocrity allow it."
"Mr pokke: “the global passives are predatory and bad for the game”
Tectone “ well if you get castorice then you are a hypocrite and don’t practice what you preach

Also tectone on the eidolons and light cones becoming necessary for characters to be usable. “this is predatory and bad for the game”

Gets eidolons for Sunday as well as the light cone anyway."
"2:34 huh? Have tectone tried and make a new account to say that its impossible to get castorice on 3 week period?. 

Cause I've made a new account and played only 3hrs for 3 days and i got almost 150 pulls already. Lol"
"For castorice defense: She has a scythe...and she's hot
Iam pulling completely f2p tho , i just started playing this month and got 85 pulls from doing the story and some events , i think as long as nobody pays them for making characters like this we will be good.. which is also impossible lol"
She's coming tomorrow
"@source324  o damn, geuss I have been lost in the sauce on poe 2"
"Sadly that doesn’t fit the narrative of everyone apparently needing Cas to play the game or “Muh account bricked” 
get ready to be called a Hoyo shill who knows how many times."
I think Hoyo only did this to Castorice and revive is pretty much taylored for beginners since Castorice is an anniversary character. I've checked all leaks for future characters and none have global passive.
Yeah exactly my thoughts as well because if you ask me castorice is hoyos favorite and mine as well she also just stands out the most from everyone​ @diluc-s7f 
because its not that deep if u dont want the unit dont pull if the passive pisses u off stop playing…what i dont understand is why does it matter that much? because those two options are quite literally available to u cuz as far as i see this passive does not affect anything…if ur so bad at the game that u need a free revive then u might as well just stop playing…this literally doesnt change shit and even if future characters get passives who gives af unless ur some meta slave that thinks they have no choice but to pull meta units …its just not that deep bro
​ @diluc-s7f  too many people wanna just think that there's 3 more coming when there's no proof that it was coming. Misinformation spreading like wildfire
​ @wolvesbane1748 Pay to win mechanics.
"Yeah, but you don't know. 

Castorice passive will work in the endgame. 
But we don't know about the other passives.
They are even real? we will see. 

It's too soon to be mad about that."
"​ @wolvesbane1748  it is, infact, deep"
I just like playing the story and characters.
"But that problem is for aglea, who is unusable without e1s1 not sunday, so idk what u r talking abt"
He proved a point that it’s bad that’s why he did it.
Sunday is perfectly functional without his lc or eidolons
 @Kaguwah proving a point by giving the company more money enabling them further instead of just showing off a e0 Sunday and explaining why he doesn’t think it’s good enough?
i feel like this is a moot point since he's quit the game and made a public spectacle of it. unless he reinstalls the game and plays in the future.
The fact you got 4 likes for saying such non sense is horrific​ @darklord2082 
Lmao bro just be yapping sometimes fr
"WAIT!
EVERYONE STOP!
WHY DID THIS GUY REBIND HIS ATTACK AND SKILL BUTTONS TO THEIR OPPOSITE?! HE'S USING AN ATTACK WITH E AND USING A SKILL WITH Q!
WHO DOES THAT?! WHY DO THAT?!"
6:20 keeps happening since genshin's first anniversary at least...
"""b-b-but castorise is a god of death a-nnd she wants to delay it...."""
hare loss
"I’m sorry but i just have to say it. Why is bro, sometimes not all the time, talking like he’s beating the meat or is just gasping for air after running 😅"
"i could make a better point for ""defending"" global passives, and that point would be that it wont affect 90%+ of the players since only a minority does endgame where global passives would be usefull, and as long as they dont balance the game under the concept of ""everyone has the character so its fine"" (given not everyone might have the characters as they dont give the character for free) its totally fine to have global passives gated behind optional characters, there is no competition in the game, there are no guilds, no leaderboards, no pvp, its purely a single player experience, my account being stronger because i decided to pull for the gacha character is completly irrelevant as the only person afected by it is me, but this only applies as long as they dont balance the game around the passives, AND even if they do, it is still irrelevant as im not competing with anyone to see who can or can not clear endgame"
She gonna be a must pull if hoyo does add in those 6 bosses ive been hearing about that have insta kill.
I'm so cooked.. lol
I was so fucking hyped for Castorice until I found out about this global passive. And with how awful the story is this time I just dont even want to play anymore.
Bro sould like:🤓🤓
people making fun of this guy for a speech impediment are so out of touch
"The amount of people in your chat and in this comment section just making fun of how this guy sounds is actually disgusting, you can disagree with him, but just leave it there instead making it personal and just making fun of him. You don't know anything about him and the name calling garbage is so unproductive and childish."
It could be a 4 added in the simulated universe shop .   A healer card that removes de buff
"I would like to remind people that a lot of things people have mentioned and things Hoyo has been doing has in fact been done in HI3. 

Ex:
1. Spending events, spend x amount of currency to get rewards and a skin
2. Tower like structures to grind for that give passive stats and abilities, relics in the dorms
And many others I don’t feel like typing

TLDR: Hoyo knows they’re saying FU to all the players. Hope this helps"
Just wait till you find out about hyacines light cone her draining hp that should be in her base kit is literally locked behind her light cone. 🤓🤓🤓
"Ok 1. Ill be honest. I didnt know About her global passive as i renamed and changed pfp. XD i just like pink haired anime girls bc im a filthy weeb. 

2. I would love to have a honest answer. If i already had a guarantee for tbe next unit. Have all the pulls saved. And intended to pull her regardless Just because of her design.... Does it matter for me personally? 

3. Im not that active on social Media. But the line ""hope this helps"" seems like a running gag. If there is someone kind and bored enough.... I would love to hear the context of it. I compleatly missed it"
You can't even watch the full video ffs
you know why hoyoverse not removing  Global Passive because they are Greedy and Stupid
Have you seen the new video of cantarella singing
"As a gacha player who doesnt play HSR, I think if the global passive is written in her kit its ok, and if it is not written in her kit, MIhoyo should give player compensation and keep the passive."
"huh? i dont see it, are you sure you took your meds, Kira?"
Brotha e is default
"​ @kkodeko     I didn't actually, it's a problem, but you can see it at 2:01"
"​ @Seylle.  In combat, E is default for using a skill and Q is default for basic attack. Dude in the video has it swapped, E is basic attack, Q is skill. At 2:01 Tectone has the video paused so you can see Rappa's skill during ult being locked, and the Attack button has E as the prompt."
"""b-b-but castorice is not even in the team...."""
@ytwaldan  XD
"it makes casuals unable to do some endgame content for the in game currency. Forces even casuals not to play their favorite characters.

As a casual playing who started the game and grinded so hard for Acheron and having super fun with her, but knowing in a couple patches this character will be useless sucks hard. 

What for did I farm on days end, went twice to pity on weapon and character, for which I had to grind all side quests, main quest and a few events that I could do? 
This game is a waste of time due to it forcing you to get the new characters and dumb old ones in trash"
" @FugIyDuck thats the thing, most casualus dont do endgame regardless, and it will always be a waste of time, its a gacha full single player"
" @lol50edu93  how are you going to gatekeep part of the game from the majority of your player base? 
The point is that people level up and invest until the point of being able to do all of the content. Yes it takes time for casuals to get to endgame, doesn‘t mean they should be scared away by the sheer hp inflation and just unfun endgame. 

I think that statement is just lazy: „Casuals don‘t play endgame, it‘s for sweats“. This company earns an ungodly sum of money, and they can‘t even make every part of the game accessible for every player and offer voluntary difficult modifiers for said endgame. 

If endgame is bad, casuals will eventually drop bad endgame and the quality will go to shit even more because diehard fans or losers will eat slop any time of the day. As a consumer, we have the right to demand more and not settle for less because these huge companies have the resources and skill, but the consumers have become so lenient so these companies see no incentive"
" @FugIyDuck  i dont gate keep it, its simply factual, the majority dont do it, you think the majority of the people play the game to beat MOC12? thats simply false, the majority of players play for 2 weeks when a new patch comes, and then quit the game until the next patch/ banner comes up, the majority of players play to get a new character and quit, thats why the game makes money, people dont have to play it every day and beat every bit of content in order to collect the characters, people can just spend money, casualls wont ""eventuallyy drop"" endgame, casuals dont do it anyway, or at least dont care if they beat it or not, characters with a good design/drip marketing make more money than poorly designed characters, why do you think the game is filled with adult females instead of children? why do you think kafka/black swan sold? because they were strong? or because the characters look good? why do you think they turned sam into a girl that spends the entire quest going on a date with you? why do you think acheron sold? because she ""exists"" in every other hoyo game and the chinese comunity(the only one that matters to hoyo) would go on strike if they didnt make her strong"
"@ I can‘t argue with you if you think being casual excludes wanting to play the entire game. No one says you have to full clear, zero cycle, do perfect run. People want their rewards so they can keep collecting their favorite characters. People WANT to use their characters. This is a strategy game after all, not a dating sim (there is plenty of those out there).

A character being visually appealing doesn’t take away from the fact that you want to be able to use that character in the game. The game had been in a better state, and previously invested characters that had been good enough to clear all of content now can‘t do shit. So ofc, someone who loved Kafka for her design and her storylore, and learned her playstyle won‘t be able to do shit, so people drop it because HSR‘s game design is trash. They don‘t want to properly balance and don‘t want to change anything because the playerbase is just not really trying to get the best out of these companies because it‘s majorily kids and people who are okay with the minimum."
"​ @FugIyDuck  ""I can‘t argue with you if you think being casual excludes wanting to play the entire game"". 
you are arguing against nobody, yyou quite literally dont get the point being made
i will try again, casuals do not play endgame, they simply dont, or at the very leaste casuals do not care about end game, they can play, but a passive being added to the game that would put them at a ""disadvantage"" is meaningless, because again, they dont care enough about end game to be bothered by it, endgame is not ""the entire game"", far from it

""No one says you have to full clear, zero cycle, do perfect run. People want their rewards so they can keep collecting their favorite characters. People WANT to use their characters.""

 to play with the character you want you have th SU game modes and DU, not endgame, one more time, casuals do not care if they get all rewards or not, they dont care about being able to do endgame, like you said yourself, they want to use their characters,how do they do that? they spend money

""A character being visually appealing doesn’t take away from the fact that you want to be able to use that character in the game.

no one is arguing against ""use what you want"", one more time, casuals dont care about end game, they will use what they want, if they beat it good, if they dont its whatever better luck next time, yes its shit design, no one argued against it

""They don‘t want to properly balance and don‘t want to change anything because the playerbase is just not really trying to get the best out of these companies because it‘s majorily kids and people who are okay with the minimum.""

what is this like 8th time or something? the majority of the player base, the casuals, dont care if the characters are strong or not, theyy will use them for 2 weaks, beat what they can, not beat what they cant, and spend money on the next character they want to have

you are tinking under the premise every single player wants to beat everything, less then 1% actually want to do everything in the game, less then 10% do end game, you could argue players not caring is a problem, sure, totally agree with that just look at genshin, years of players not caring and you cant get full resin in 24 hours

if you are arguing for everyplayer should be able to beat end game then i would have to disagree, not every player should be able to,  that is something for players who invest in the game (be it time or money), what is the point of you trying do always get everything every patch to make sure you can pull a character, if at the end of the day you can just use arlan and beat the entire endgame? endgame is not a for fun mode, it takes investment, its meaningless investment as this is a gacha game, but you cant penalize players for trying to always keep up with the game when you can do everything without keeping up with the game"
bump
Sums up tectones audience ngl
"This is so true 😂
They've been doing this since HI3"
"1. Pull who you want to pull in the end it’s your choice don’t let others shame you for that.

2. The VA for Paimon had a meltdown calling everyone idiots for doubting the SAG strike when her and other VA’s started harassing a new VA replacing kinich that’s the line she ended the rant on."
@benperbix7614  thank you very much. Im a little smarter now^^
The big issue is HSR is like Genshin where new interesting systems are all paid only. A new user vs a veteran is exactly the same gameplay wise if they dont pull new units.
"The dude is literally the collective thoughts of every Hoyo-cucks that defending the Global Passive made manifest. They are literally screaming ""DA WEI, MILK US MORE!!! PLEASE MAKE GLOBAL PASSIVES MORE SO IT CAN FILTER THE PLAYER BASE!!!"" . I shit you not on how many hoyo-cucks are actually saying that they wanted to have move global passives to filter the player base and they don't actually care about their past investments on older characters they pulled before. These people are cartoonishly stupid i can't even believe they are real human beings. 😐"
This was a gibberish burger.
They should have made it an unlockable character from farming or story. It would be like the blueprint ships from azur lane. Everyone can get them but it takes a long time.
RIP HoyoSheet
I wonder if we put anything on the reviews about skill trees that they might put them in but hoyo never listened. We all know that
Clicks on the guys video: the video is private 👍
I can't believe the blatant misinformation in this video. We're on Dawei's 6th yacht.
"What you will see with Hoyoverse Tactics of Money Making is they chopped off the most important Base Kit of the characters and Sell it into their Eidolons and Signature Lightcone.

And the Worst Case here is that they  Normalize these Predatory Practices or PP Through the Use of Content Creators. Business is all about Marketing and Psychological Manipulation through Social Media and Lots of people are falling to this Basic urge. They know where to hit you so you spend more Money to them."
"Frankly speaking im ust waiting for NTE.. 
honkai is just timepass"
he sounds extremely overweight
Give the MC and a free 4 star global passives
These people are trying to farm the shills. We really do have the next Genshin war coming.
"You can like Star Rail despite everything but don't shill. I love Star Rail, and I'll keep playing, but global passives being locked behind limited 5 stars is extremely predatory, and there's no excuse"
HOW IS THIS GUY diyng while farming for chest or resource??? HOW???? its impossible to die unless you doing it on purpose.. looking for chest is a 10 minute business every 6week maximum... IDK why he things is so important....
"New players can't easily get Bailu, but they can farm Castorice... You said new players can't pull Castorice because of the 3-weeks duration... Did you dmg your brain so bad?

And also Genshin already implemented global passives long time ago"
I think anyone who equates bailu and castoris is an idiot. Hey I mean bailu can only revive 1 character and that's if bailu isn't dead Hell Nah. 😂😂😂
"When Castorice’s passive went live, I believe they should make more global passives. HSR players deserve to go bankrupt for their stupidity in supporting this dog company"
"Yeah the castorice global passive is not that bad. The problem is the existence of global passive behind the character. That's the problem. They should make it like wuwa, whimpering waste. Make it like a token."
IS THAT LITERALLY A TRASH MOB..IMAGINE HAVING NO CREATIVITY FOR MAKING THAT MOB
"They did?

I don't play genshit so I don't know"
bruh at least the global passive in Genshin wasnt combat focused i dunno why i should even be saying it cuz combat is more important if it affects End-Game.
"Global reraise will help new accounts, this game is very hard at the beginning. You can try it yourself, create a new acc...

New acc is going to pull Castorice for sure, 3-weeks is enough to farm 30k jades"
 @LimC.A  and why do we get so paranoid about the future of HSR global passives ? Genshin never implemented something bad or ruin the game to its global passives...
"For sure, they wont implement global passive that increases SPD to all units, because it will ruin Tribbie / Castorice and also all other units"
"Even if they decide to add new gloval passives that affect combat, Hoyo is not stupid and make those passives to powerfull... You shouldn't compare Tectone's braincells to Hoyo's"
" @hianfly  They can just code the spd increase to only take effect after combat starts, which wouldn't ruin the relic sets at all."
 @drakingp2119  yes but it doesn't mean they will do it... this kind of paranoia is crazy... It seems you know nothing about dynamic SPD like that can ruin your relics setup
"@ I didn't say they would, I'm pointing out how you can implement the passive without destroying those characters due to how their relic sets work.

And even then, highly doubtful that you're gonna brick your account or units with it.

I doubt them adding a spd passive, but I don't think arguing that it'll ruin those characters is gonna prove that point."
"They wont release crit rate / def pen / res pen because those buffs are destructive to the game... I think, they are not that STUPID"
"​ @LimC.A genshin has global passive???

(Never played genshin so i dont know)"
"@ the said ""global passive"" is just crafting materials,being able to view pickable materials/ores in the map while near you,running faster and thats it that doesnt affect combat in the slightest."
"Genshin focus is exploration, so those global passives are very good there"
Tldr; you can't deny that Genshin had has global passives for a long time ago...
say that to the cn community
HSR will pretty much die along with GI because they're both made by the same company.
​ @yato9565  gi never died and never will. Same with hsr. That's the sad reality
"@ashiqprio2485  Pretty much, yes. But stories from both games are quite amazing, though."
" @yato9565  for me they are average at best for most part. I guess they are good for a gacha standard but even games like arknights, nikke, pgr, limbus company and even their previous honkai series have better stories. I would have let it pass if they had great storytelling like wuwa and zzz but nope. But i would say genshin's Fontaine arc was really good but they couldn't hold on to that quality in natlan"
"They will die, every game will meet their end. No such thing as eternal game ​ @ashiqprio2485 "
 @ashiqprio2485  if only wuwa story has been that good from the beginning lol. i still cant get through the jinzhou act because of how jarring and bad paced it is
" @ilham9108  just use the holy skip button 
For me only 1.1 was good, 1.3 is mid and the rest are 🗑"
"Bro is out here dying to mobs in the overworld.  😂

I thought bro was going to argue that he rarely dies or something.

As for it reviving multiple people, all the footage that comes up, or from the live, is of one unit being revived."
ta
"The fact that we're still on this is kinda sad at this point. If it's something you don't like, why make content off of it genuinely."
"Why ppl still play this game is beyond me, it peaked in like 1.2, what more is there to experience from this game other than a monotonous long story you can't skip and autoable combat which incentivises you to not even play the game?"
And the video is private who coulda guessed lul
Cmon man now the video is taken down 😂
He privated the video lmao
Can't finish the video. Its unbearable to listen to a literal mouth breather 😫
“Hope this helps” 😂
Why does the guy sounds like he's constantly on the verge of vomiting?
"Wouldn't everyone having access to the global passive via some tower system be terrible? Because it would cause the devs to develop the game around having that access, which would also just further time gate newer players. It's not as if the devs designed the game around people having access to an instant overkill button for mobs in the overworld via Acheron, or chests that would be impossible to find if not for The Herta, so why would it be different for Castorice?

The appeal to the slippery slope is fallacious if you can't meaningfully demonstrate that slope. Anyone at any point in time can imagine a slope, but I think if we're intellectually honest we can all agree that it would be unreasonable to never walk again because you might've slipped and fell once before."
"I'm pulling Castorice bc i want her on my account, i have multiple E2 characters (Acheron, Firefly) so i dont feel like the passive ""helps"" my account, I just have wanted her since seeing the 3.0 teasers (ive skipped every 3.0 banner until now). I won't be spending any money on her banner (I have guaranteed and enough free earned jades to get her) nor will I be going for any eidolons. I simply am pulling her because I want her.

But in regards to the global passive, it was NOT needed nor asked for, it just sucks that its attached to Castorice since she's a very popular character that people would want to pull for. Same could be said for people who really like Mydei, The Herta, etc etc and if the passive was attached to one of those characters instead. Now people who have a Castorice will be seen as someone who essentially approves of the global passives when majority of us pulling for her are casual players who just like her design and playstyle, and the dragon ofc. Not all upcoming characters will have a GP but any that do will be frowned upon to pull for and it does nothing but cause a divide in the player base bc Hoyo wants more money and goes about it in the worst ways possible. 

Make HSR Great Again..."
Yeh it's soo bad it was worth loosing a friend over.
Why is that guy talking about the games only 3star character?
"AND I QUOTE “this patch has a lot of good things, free character in the future…”"
"51 mins after Teccy reacts, og video is already unavailable. LMAO"
"The herta was the reason i quit star rail completely. I pretty much stopped already before she released, but thought might as well try pull her with the jades i got. 

Didn't get her tho and i got tired of spending money for characters, so i quit. Pretty much planning to stop spending as much on zzz too. Way too many hard pitys in a row..."
imagine if youre just starting out and you find out theres a character that you must have cus your copy of the game is literally inferior without it. its like a dlc but its not available to buy anytime. you have to wait for it to and only god knows when itll pop up again. its not jsut one dlc. but like 5 or more. and even if you own maybe 1 or 2. its still inferior cus you need em all.
"The reasons why global passives on limited 5stars are good
1. Buffs your older characters
2. More incentive to pull new units, game is all about meta anyway, getting 5-6 global passive exodia is the future of this game
3. Limited 5 stars become future proof even if they are powercrept 
4. Hoyo can shift the power budget into passives instead of powercreeping every character every patch
5. Global passives (especially future ones) add a layer of convenience for players struggling to balance relics and lacking light cone stats
6. This passive in particular is very nice for sustainless teams in certain scenarios which is a good QOL for people lacking meta sustains 
7. Global passives are just little bonuses and if we get a lot more of them in the future its very likely that in order to keep the game running smoothly there will be a limit on how many can be active at once. And that means there is nothing to worry about because you can already acquire most characters even as a f2p. So that implies you will have plenty of options to choose from. Just need to wait till more characters come out"
its more than one character what
For money and to bring attention to it.
"Because it sets a bad precedent for the industry.  When a market leader introduced a scummy fomo mechanic that only the most predatory C list games employ, it has potential of being introduced in other games if it succeeds.  Ubisoft getting away with single player qol dlc is a good example of this, all of a sudden after that a ton of games after that started doing it too, most notably bandai namco, sony, and ea.  the market isnt a vacuum.  and when star wars battlefront got massive backlash for its incredibly scummy monetization where u have to play 60 years to earn a character f2p, after that no other game attempted to be that scummy.

i know hoyo players may not play other games, but this is a gamers perspective on why we care, its an eternal battle between predatory monetization and fomo practices and the player in a ever more costly world."
"@authenticinari-fox8164 is understandable, but regardless of that, my point is if you've already thrown said game out the window why make more content on it as if your gonna change there minds and even if they did change there minds its not like your just gonna magically start playing it again I see it as pointless tbh."
"​ @juicy1jstn974 because it brings them money and views, yes its bad to have it in game, but it aint illegal, if it was then just sue the damn company problem done, but of course streamers are only big on talk they cant back it up outside of their community. 😂 so they farm it and have idiots watch it while they roll in profit😂"
"​ @authenticinari-fox8164  tectone don't really want to improve the industry let's be real 
He is just farming views because u know how big the hoyo fandom is 
He hates hoyoverse that's it"
​ @yuji_09 why would you want hoyoverse to improve when it's helping content creators? In fact fomoverse are unironically helping cc farm money lmfa
"Why you surprised? He doesn't like Genshin, yet he keep making genshin videos for years. You should know that he will do the same for Hsr"
I still like the story and I like the characters plus the found family stuff with the astral express.
"I’ll explain it this way. It wouldn’t be bad because they already have the perfect system to tie it in with built into the game already, the equilibrium levels. It wouldn’t be so easy to have it to where after a certain equilibrium level, you gain currency to unlock buffs in a linear tree that affect the world. And for the whole Acheron and Therta scenario, those two are just gimmicks that aren’t really that useful outside of the a few exceptions like DU for Acheron and spamming combat encounters and you could literally just use YouTube to find all the chests. But for the castorice passive being put to a tower or something, you don’t really have to reinvent the wheel there. “If you check your buffs list, you will find buff x that you acquired that will give your character 1 extra life after reaching 0 hp. They need to either be shielded or healed before their next turn or die as soon as they take there next turn. And it would literally be as easy as disabling the passive for endgame modes entirely and the issue is solved, not more problem. Either that or having it ONLY work for castorice. Hell you could even extend it to any chrysos (however it’s spelled) heir characters on your team and it’ll be WAY better AND cool lore wise. Sorry for rambling, hope you got something useful out of my point of view, I can see why you’d think the way you do as well."
"The difference is that Acheron's and Herta's abilities are a quality of life that can't affect late game content.
Castorice's global passive does.
You might have seen how the MoC became overtuned, where using the same characters people were unable to 3-star MoC level 10, when in the MoC just before that, level 12 bosses had less HP than that level 10.
Hoyo does and will tune combat encounters around limited characters.
A tower system would allow everyone to be at the same playing field. Limited character global passives could fuck over everyone who doesn't have that limited character.
Hoyo could introduce a boss that does a billion damage once per battle, if you have Castorice it's like nothing happened, if you don't have Castorice then you can't beat that boss. If the same boss was made with a tower system being in place then all you'd need to do is do the content that gives you the ability to survive, instead of having access to a character who might not even be available for years after the first run.

Players gain nothing by having the global passive on a limited character instead of it being tied to an in-game system, but players who don't have the character could be at a serious disadvantage compared to ones who do."
I wish I could set it to show me this comment again in 6 months time to see if it's aged well or not.
" @KiraNightV  All of that could've just been summed to one word: ""Could"".

I'll repeat myself, show me something in all of hsr history, where clearing endgame was gatekept by a single limited unit (You won't be able to so don't bother). You're pointing to one imaginary point on a graph and describing a slope, when, at least mathematically, you need at least two points on a graph to show a slope. Logically, you need many points to even begin to justify a slippery slope appeal.

Furthermore, you speak of quality of life as if it can't be applied to endgame, when there's nothing mutually exclusive about the two. Nearly everyone during 1.x complained about their Tingyun dying that it became a meme, and most of the time it was just bad luck, so this prevents one reset and saves time."
" @gameplayerone3917  boss HPs has been increasing with every single MoC patch, I brought up an example for the biggest jump we've had recently.
I wasn't bringing up MoC because I think it proves that there's a slippery slope. The fact that Castorice isn't the only limited character with a global passive who will be released during Amphoreous, is.
People who have beta access have already confirmed that there are other characters who will have global passives.
And before you try to argue that ""they're not out yet so we won't know if the global passives will stay"", we had the info about Castorice way before she dropped and even though people complained the global passive is still there, so there's no reason for Hoyo to not make other characters with global passives.

I was being hyperbolic about a boss dealing a billion damage, but I don't see how it would be worse for the players to be able to get the global passive after the character banner isn't available.

Tingyun getting killed because of dumb luck is 1 thing, but if you think about it, her reviving mid-combat is not the same as a new reset. Let's just imagine a scenario where your sustain can't keep up with the boss damage and your characters get slowly get stacked with debuffs that deal more damage than your sustain can counter. We already have stacking damages that enemies can deal and with how the bosses have kept getting stronger with every patch there will be a point where they deal more damage than you can heal. Now adding in Castorice's passive will mean that the character who would have otherwise died will continue like nothing happened. At that point, it's not up to luck that your character died, it's an inevitability, but Castorice can prolong it long enough to get you through, meaning that there absolutely is a way that you be indirectly gatekept by not having her."
"​ @KiraNightV I don't know why y'all can't admit that you're just unable to substantiate your theory, save yourself the time.

Also, you did just appeal to the slippery slope argument. I did assume at first, but you confirmed it so my assumption turned out to be correct. Maybe your assumption about Castorice's global passive will turn out to be correct too, but it's just that, an assumption."
" @gameplayerone3917  bro, just because you don't understand what I'm saying doesn't mean that it's not substantiated. if I bring up a point and you just say ""nah"", that doesn't mean you're in the right.
stop trying to aura farm, Castorice's global passive is a warning sign, a red flag, that doesn't mean HSR is going to EOS immediately, but you need to stop huffing copium saying ""it's not that bad"", because that's exactly how a slope starts.
I'll use this word again, it COULD get better, it COULD make Hoyo not have global passives for other characters, but having one has already crossed a line and Hoyo doesn't have any incentive not to cross it more than once when it brings them more money."
" @KiraNightV  It's worse than I thought, you don't even know what evidence is. Or maybe I'm blind, because I didn't see you provide any example where endgame was gatekept by a single limited unit, or a mechanic unique to them. All you seem to have done is point to some general hp inflation and a mere future possibility. In which case, that's called speculation, not evidence. I very clearly laid out what I was looking for, so I apologize that I'm not taking your speculation seriously, but in all fairness, it was a very unserious response.  

Unfortunately, if you don't even understand what counts as evidence then nothing I'm saying will make any sense. Guess we'll just have to agree to disagree."
"All the leak rumors that chars are in work with global passives were fake. Streamers sloped it like idiots, this global passive is nothing at all, i am a e6s5 player since day 1 spent 240k on the game now, my f2p acc got mydei e2s1 lately and he can solo moc12 because infinite revives. So people bitch too much and create too much drama, plus standard banner is getting rememberence char, watch it be castorice so her passive be for all, watch streamers act like hypocrites then 😂😂😂😂"
" @yue4405 1.
Stating you spent 240K on the game is not the flex you think it is. 

2. We are 10000% getting more global passives. You genuinely believe Castorice will be the only one? They are testing the waters with it, and obviously have more coming since they already have the content planned a year in advance. 

3. To claim Castorice will be on the standard banner. Actual copium. Genuinely delusional."
"@thawingkarma233  lol if they get too much backlash from players they can just milk her banner then announce she is going into standard banner in 3.4 or 3.6 just to shup idiots up, i personally do not give a fuck if we get or dont get global passives, it doesnt affect me, there is no hard enough content to benefit from it, plus even curreny moc you can clear with seele and pela, tingyun and rmc or even jingliu can clear it in less than 5 cycles, so those passives wont do rats ass for those players who already clear shit with ease in the game and got damn well built chars, they will only allow casual players to have easier time instead of thinking, as for your in advance lol there is currently not a single char for next 4 patches that has global passive, we know all legit leaks of every char coming for next 4 patches and none of them has a global passive. As for you thinking 240k spent was a flex nah it wasnt its just how bad rng on 50/50 actually is i had 10 banners where i lost 6 50/50 in a row i dont care much for that because i can afford it, which is why i help friends get thier pulls if they are sort."
" @yue4405  They are not going to send the new shiny toy and one of the most broken newly released units into the standard banner regardless of how much backlash they get, and they won’t even care because the worst that will happen is them loosing just a couple million dollars. And they’re still going to introduce more global passives down the line, that’s just a no-brainer. 

And it’s weird for you to claim it isn’t a flex when you are literally mentioning how much you’re spending in these gacha games in pretty much all of your other comments."
"@thawingkarma233  no brainer huh and where is your factual evidence that they will do so? And if its a flex then why the fuck would i be giving 180 days of express passes or getting them jades for e0s1 or e2s1 depending on what char need to people in discord server i am? Its about 25 to 30 people every patch, And reason i can do it is because i have shit ton of money from investing and running corporate business for last 12 years, despite how i sound about games and passives, i am a nice person who actually helps people in discords to get stuff when they cant. And if i wanted to flex, i just post a pic of my bank account. But instead i am helping out f2p and low spenders in hsr,zzz,genshin because thats my way of giving back what i made by being lucky and working hard. 😷 now days all the communities are shit and full of drama, you all play a damn game, people hating on a game because of new inovations in the game, fucking laughable, no one asks people to spend, no one forces them to spend either, the game is easy enough that you dont need brand new toys to beat content, its like if my company made cure for blood cancer and charged $100 for it, people would make drama over it becausr it aint free, yet company spends bilions in research lol. Hsr aint a bad game is people creating big ass drama over shit that plenty of other games got already or because of their own personal assumptions without any factual evidence"
" @thawingkarma233  whether they do or dont its up to them, not like the game is hard enough to need global passive, you can legit beat current content using 1.0 and 2.0 chars with no issue if you build them good enough which with current gears is easy, as for flexing i dont. I might say shit about global passive not being bad, but its still predatory in the end, i made my cash from investing and running medical business for last 12 years+, i help people in server i am in to get express passes, across their games and e0s1 or e2s1 chars when they needed it, like this drama over global passive is pathetic, just because streamers farm it for views to earn some lousy paycheck, instead of being more productive. Its like people complainng and creating drama over my company making meds for blood cancer, and charging $100 for it yet, 300mil+ was spent in research but no one considers that lol. I rather people have fun in their game than for them to hear shit drama over video game xD i told people in server i am in you lose your 50/50 @ me and i send you jades to get it, same for pass. I have far to much cash to begin with. Donating to charity is meh now days, i rather spend 400k+ a year on people i know will enjoy and have fun, and stress less, than to give 1mil to charity and know that in reality only 5% be given to the cause. Charity donations is corporate tax break nothing more. Despite you thinking that its a flex its not, just way to say how shit 50/50 rates are, if i wanted to flex i post pic of bank acc xD"
" @yue4405 except their not going to move her to the standard banner cuz that’d basically be false advertising:


Secondly if they wanted to do that they would’ve announced that she’d move to the standard banner now instead of waiting till after her banner to say something."
"@amari7782  nah it wouldnt be, because blade and seele and fu xuan getting moved to standard banner, there for that exlusive limited character thing no longer exist, just because someone spends to get character earlier. Thats on the people, They can move any char into standard banner because its their game, and you all signed that you allow them to make changes to their game, moment you made accounts, So if law is considered its fair game, if it wasn't then seele and blade and fu xuan being moved to standard would be subjected to class action lawsuit over their limited status. Given that players pull for chars due to ""Limited time banner"" so them moving those three down to standard or making them free would be breaching consumer rights"
"@ making them free is one thing, and even then their vastly older units who are tied to a different system instead of being completely removed from the limited pool.

But again if they were going to move her to standard or make her free they would’ve already announced it  it’s the same reason why they can’t change stuff a lot on release"
" @amari7782  doesnt matter, because i am pretty sure my lawyer would find a legal hole in this easily, consumer right got massive scope, for hoyo to be free of any wromg doing they would have to announce at lunch of game, that limited banner units will be put into standard banner sometime during game life cycle, making them pullable with free currency, That way consumers wouldnt go so hard on those units, if they knew that they might become free. Which if a good lawyer would look at it, they would easily find it illegal and a breach of consumer rights. And start   class action against hoyo, and screen through player base of who has set units so they get refunded. Due to it being false advertisment at start of the game."
Look i didn't even know that he reacted to it until a few hours ago after I put the video back up
"​ @ImThatGhostYT  do you have a condition irl? not trying to insult, genuine question"
" @kkodeko  is ""english not your first language"" considered a condition?"
Bro forgot there are people playing just for fun and the story
 @Ayush-kc2vx except what exactly is there to do “for fun” most casuals don’t touch end game which means there’s next to no content in the game to play with and the story isn’t even good to justify playing solely for it
" @amari7782  Sim Uni, story enjoyment is subjective not objective. You might not enjoy it, you not enjoying it doesn't mean a lot of other people don't enjoy it."
@ sim uni is also endgame
"@ There is end game sim uni, and there is also casual play sim uni. And it would be very disingenous to say Sim uni endgame is anywhere near the same level as MoC, Apoc, or PF, in terms of being endgame."
"@ except what would constitute as not endgame?

All the listed versions of endgame you’ve listed have is just bloated hp pools some random mechanic to give it some spice. 
Sim uni is still end game content as all end game content is just repetitive content that gives rewards. None of their game modes are that unique people just talk bout them cuz mic and the others are something that mildly stimulate the brain enough to be memorable"
@amari7782  sim universe is not an end game mode you can beat that game mode even if you run an team of 4 sustains you just need to right blessings
@amari7782  in an turn based game you will always get repetitive content
"@ you do realize that end game modes are optional content that’s not tied to the story mode for a game right?

It doesn’t matter the difficulty of the mode if it’s optional content then it’s end Game.

People just twisted the definition of endgame to exclusively need to be difficult content"
" @amari7782  I can hop into Gold and Gears at any level right now.

I can play DU and just do different runs right now.

I can go and play base sim uni or swarm disaster right now

I can do all of that for no rewards and are always. I can go and play the rogue like game modes just for the fun of it.

Your definition is just trying to be broad for the sake of it. Sim Uni is giving completion rewards, after you reach that point it stops rewarding you.

You are trying to extend the definition of endgame but you and I both know that when anybody says endgame in HSR they are talking about MoC, PF, and Apoc. Difficulty V Sim Uni does not register in anybody's mind and even then that game mode makes everyone viable to play by just giving you the stats.

There is a difference between endgame and gameplay that has difficulty tiers.

With your logic replaying story missions, if we could do that, would count as endgame since at one point they gave jades."
@ I mean repeatable content also repetitive comtent exist in ton turn based games. But at this point you guys are stretching the goal post to the point everyone in this thread is more focus on pointlessly discussing what counts as endgame than actually getting to a meaningful point
"@ yes, replaying story content would also be end game since it’s optional content

All rewards do is give people a reason to do the optional content, congrats you understand what endgame is, now I gotta ask how exactly does any of this change my statement  of “casuals don’t play endgame”? Because all you guys did was pointless yap in a circle over the specifics while going absolutely nowhere"
@ Bro you just classified the entire game as endgame. We can't go anywhere cause you're actively just being disingenuous.
" @drakingp2119   doing story content because you need it to unlock content and regions is different from REPEATING story content for jades
You are doing these things for 2 completely different sets of reasons how are you this braindead that you fail to understand the very example YOU MADE"
@ again what point are you trying even make because all you’ve done is spend more time discussing wat counts as end game than actually getting to a point
"@ No I made the point like at the start, you just decided you didn't like the answer and popped domain expansion: Shift Goal post to side step the point. Sim Uni and a replayable story mode are not endgame, casual players play sim uni. Casual players do runs in the various sim uni modes even if they don't get rewards. Casual players also just replay endgame modes for the fun of it to test different teams.

We got to the point you just keep rejecting it with overly broad definitions."
"@ optional content is endgame content just because there’s a specific set of modes that are different that the community solely classifies as endgame doesn’t mean anything.

My main point is HSR doesn’t really have much that really worth staying for"
 @amari7782 I stay for story and characters.
 @benperbix7614  cool
"These are some crazy bad reasons.
1. U have to gamble to get the new character so its not a guarantee that you get the character if you are a f2p or light spender it may buff it but its for a price of not being able to pull any character that you want.
2. There is already ENOUGH incentive to pull new units because they powercrept the hell out of the old ones anyways and are jacking up the hp of every piece of content in the game.
3. How is a limited 5 star gonna be ""Future Proof"" if for example a character is just dogshit but has a great global passive like 5% crit rate its just gonna be sitting in your account doing NOTHING except give the bonus. edit: I realized that this is future proof this is a bad argument but doesn't change the fact you have to pay for this and you have to choose this over another character. That was the point of my argument
4. Hoyo just gonna shift power budget into both now. Both global passive and base kits gonna get more and more nuts. Its literally their track record.
5. This is not a layer of convenience because now you have to choose between a global passive or a unit that you want. F2Ps and light spenders dont get enough currency to guarantee a character every patch so whats gonna happen if a patch as 2 global passives? Just spend? just wait for rerun? just get lucky? because just spend or get lucky is a retarded argument that doesn't even need an explanation if you need to understand that i pray for you. Now the wait for rerun argument. Probably gonna get powercrept according to hoyo's track record and we don't have enough to guarantee a character a patch and there are 2 new ones every patch so what do people do then?
6. This is not a good QOL because its not a free QOL. AGAIN you have to pay for this.
7. No the global passive will not be little bonuses. They will be roadblocks for people who cannot obtain said characters. Hoyo does not give enough pulls to guarantee a character every patch not to mention their lightcones. This doesn't give more options this limits options forcing players to pull on character that have good global passives in order to keep up with the meta. If you don't account is worse than someone who does."
"This has to be satire, there's no way."
" @karma3870  my initial comment was just pure irony but now that i come to think about it, shouldn’t you be spending in gacha games anyways? Like that’s the point of gachas. They’re not meant to be played for free. Yes, you can try the game and it’s absolutely free. But if you want the best experience then pay up, corpas need money and fun activities like playing videogames cost money for the consumer. Just like going to the movies or going to a club, going to a sports event. Now this sucks for people who can’t afford a global passive character but then that means you should probably not be spending your free time playing video games (gachas in particular). 
Ok actually, I don’t truly believe in what i’ve just said, but it does feel like people are very disillusioned with games being free and them having the notion that all content should be free too, which clearly isn’t the case because companies are made to earn money and adding these new passives is a good way to boost revenues. 
And you shouldn’t be disappointed with the fact that the company is earning billions either. Their profits show that they have a successful business model and that they have a good game/product and for all its worth you can make a similar game and be earning the same amount of money, everyone says “oh it costs nothing to develop hsr but dawei needs another yacht he is greedy and stupid” ye sure, if it was that simple, we’d have 20 hsr clones on the market. 
Yes, global passives suck for the average consumer but this is a gacha and if castorices banner beats records then that’s just going to prove that hoyo knows what theyre doing"
 @Zarya.  yea but you can still call out bad practices instead of supporting it. I think the most recent example is Nintendo switch. Like seriously paying that much for a console and game as well as a tutorial?? I get it just do whatever you want but calling out these bad practices seems to be so uncommon in the gacha space. Maybe everyone is just tuned out but still.
"@ i agree but the community is definitely overreacting on this one. A Global passive is the same as any powercreep like jingliu like acheron like feixiao like the herta, couldn’t care much about it, its been the same thing every patch. Everyone keeps playing and keeps pulling and the community is shitting on players for not having eidolons/lightcones/meta supports and its never going to be better. Calling out every “bad business practice” is the same as calling out everything in every new patch but players are continuing to play the game and it doesn’t seem to matter for most and its not our right to stop them from enjoying this predatory game, you can hate them though but like xd “telling the truth” and being a hater to those people who don’t care, that’s not what i want to sign up for, i’ve got other things to care about irl"
"oh hey, i submitted this in the daily scramble"
Bye bye
"Nah I don't care if my account is infinitely worse than the next guy's as long as I get the character that I want. Oh shit the next character buffs 100% cdmg for all units globally but it's on a character I don't care about? Who cares, next."
"It just needed to be a normal passive. Cas actively kills your team, having that safeguard would have been fine. All this has shown me is I need to quit. Not even because of the global passive, but because this community desires the game to be shit.
I cannot wait for the day a global passive increasing pure dmg happens. Because all this ""we do not know it will happen again"" and ""oh but this one is not that op"" is going to fall apart at that point. And I have zero hope for this game, so I would rather it fall off a cliff and provide entertainment at launching at the shit eaters. This point Hoyo deserves their money with how much they have trapped their minds to support them, its impressive really."
"Dude, why does he sound like he's dying lol"
"“There is no global passive in ba sing se” , “There is no global passive in ba sing se”"
Even some older players who can't afford or are f2p can't pull the character this game is cooked (also fuck em idc I'll play wuwa anniversary incomming woohooooooo)
As a cookie run kingdom player I don't care about this News I'm just here to preach the cookbook ❤
OMG THIS VIDEO IS DOGSHIT! BUT THE CHAT??????  🔥🔥🔥🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This guy really needs to just sit back and calm down. So out of breath.
hope this helps!
Brother im tryna go to sleep to your vid stop playing 4 adds on 8min videos baldy
Oiled up tectone
man sometimes i just wanna hear teccy finally SAY IT momoi
what a painful video to watch
Another 21 days of good for new players
"The reason why I am pulling for Castorice is that I love death-themed characters, Scythe users, and dragons. She got all of them so 😩👌…

Edit: Hey guys! I am a small youtuber who just started recently! I’ll be adding more videos to my channel soon ❤."
Maybe the real global passive was the friends we made along the way.
You see Google play store now 2.8 rate 😅what happens HSR😅
"you should react to ""Catorice global passive is  bad..but not the end of the world"" it does a better job explaining things"
That's cool until Hoyo inevitably balances all end game expecting you to have that 100% cdmg.
"@Ilasperr  well, if I can't clear the end game, then so be it. Who cares. In the end, like I said, I still got the characters I wanted. I'm here to goon to the hot characters not some numbers on the screen or some virtual currency."
FACTS MY COOKIE SPEAK YOUR THANG INDEED
"No, the real global passive is breaking friends apart. 😂"
*lost along the way
What friend?
It's 2.3 for me 🫥
This guy sounds like he's having a hard time breathing
"I mean it's not a stat boosts, it's just revival.
But whatever who cares."
"Just make the MC have the global passive, hello?"
If you look closely at Tectone's bald head you can see the light of a dying star from millions of years ago hitting it
5:00 exactly you should also criticize wuwa for doing it
It's a nothing burger bro.
Good 'ol Baldy back to farming the nearby air for dumbasses only to bring attention to them which definitely doesn't historically spiral down a dumb drama where the dude gets a massive head and becomes desperate for attention!
Don't let Tectone's bald head distract you from the fact that Castorice's global passive sets a dangerous precedent for gacha games.
the guy in the video speaks so slow like he is out of breath or something:face-orange-biting-nails::face-orange-biting-nails:
A newer player pulling Castorice would use her. Still no reason for it to be global
Is not that
"the guys voice that ur reacting to is so ubearable to listen to, I imagine tat this is how global passhills sound like on a daily basis"
"its not that the global is bad, its just the concept of it and how future characters will become must pulls. Pro tip: dont pull for a character just because of that, only pull if you like them or like their playstyle."
No no no it IS that bad
"Guy's video is went up in flames faster than hoyos revenue from farming the financially nearsighted. 

Remember, it's not the CONCEPT of the global passive. It's not the EFFECT of the res. It's the global passive being LOCKED TO A LIMITED CHARACTER you have to spend currency on. Open your wallet. Please, let us farm you."
If you just pull the character you get a universal buff that's so unbalanced people just going to pull the characters that give buffs then the characters that people want
My god that thumbnail showing that like to dislike ratio the amount of dislikes dam
is the guy talking ok?
Pokke could learn a lot from this dude
"Him: ""This is good for new players""

Also him: ""Just pull Bailu or get a very specific blessing that may or may not appear in Sim Uni""

Oh yeah I'm sure the newer players will all get Bailu and Castorice in 1 10 pull 😭"
Neptunia based. But the larger problem is that it’ll inevitably be a stat boost
 @Richkero1993 The thing is that’s just speculation not confirmation.
Mc doesn’t sell
​ @Gaze-fu4bv  HSR MC has always been a meta unit so i don't know what you even mean by that
 @Ayush-kc2vx  so now always means since 2.0?
@Ayush-kc2vx  u can't spend money on MC...unless if it's a sig LC...but like...no one is doing that.
" @Ayush-kc2vx  they can’t make people spend money for the MC, everyone has them and you can only obtain eidelons through f2p ways"
 @AntoninSimard-b1d  i think you are forgetting that fire MC was also good when he first came out. An AoE taunt skill was good at that time when enemies didn't hit as hard as they do now
​ @Ayush-kc2vx  it was good till it got replaced by something else that does it job better
"​ @Ayush-kc2vx you completely missed his point.  hes saying putting global passive on a free character(mc) doesnt sell, because you know, THE MC IS FREE"
 @shurenshimitri5874  ya cuz they had to release another MC. Just like how they released fugue cuz HMC will switch to RMC for the entirety of 3.x
"Why not give all characters a global passive. Give mc 4 global passive, one for each path. 😂"
" @Ayush-kc2vx  They say ""Doesn't sell"", which literally mean ""Hoyo make no money for putting a fomo passive on free unit"""
"yup if mc have global passive skill, i think community should calm for a while, because all players deserve have this without pull from gacha. But from DaWei simulator games, impossible hahahahahaha"
"Or better yet, do what wuwa did with spectro rover and make global passives obtainable via story completion. It would even be an easier way to explain the ability through lore without a bullshit last minute answer like “she don’t likey death 😭”"
Hello!
"​ @Gaze-fu4bv It does, by making the game more popular and attracting a new audience, but it is more advanced marketing technique that require you to not treat your customers like shit."
Early leaks I saw someone mentioning they might add the passive in some other way for everyone in later patches.
" @Ayush-kc2vx  good in what? being a free trial version of fuxuan? No cleanse, no heal,  and extremely skill point demanding, the only thing they can handle is the monkey"
" @Ayush-kc2vx He means what he means. The MC doesn’t sell. Like, it’s not that hard to understand."
i dont get the whole deal about this global passive. mydei can revive if he dies whenever he goes into that red aura mode and he can basically not die multiple times per match and i dont see people complaining
🤩
😂😂
🤣🤣😭
a good comment
huh?
Like what😅wuwa don't have global bs.
Care to provide an example that is remotely similar?
"He’s talking about Cantarella swimming like 15-25% faster than other characters. @wellysen Swimming passive isn’t particularly useful since the new area you can fly, use a boat that goes exponentially faster than swimming, etc. Shorekeeper is the only other one with something similar but she turns into a butterfly and goes slightly faster as well as Lumi. But that isn’t an issue due to speed boosts all over the map etc. The swimming passive also does barely anything in the prior areas since there’s little to no places no reasons to go swimming."
 @rrSpaced Kinda weird how people take her passive as a negative and consider it predatory when most features similar to it can be used for free
Dis dumbass wanna drag wuwa on hsr topic just like other west cc
 @rrSpaced  its lik the same crap they pulled on Neuvillete and no one was complaining on that one huh...double standards btw the passive was swim slightly faster in under-water areas and it was unique only to him.
"Cantarella can swim for long time but do we need swimming in Wuwa , if something comes up devs will take care"
"If you mean swimming  Cantella, she doesn't work in the tower."
"yup, his argument makes no sense."
"That bad.
In the end of the day is just a game 😂😂😂"
"People with slurred speech need to be banned from media. Choose a diff career.

Also an actual mouth breather lol."
He is fighting for hoyo contact or early access :D :D
"I thought I'm the only one who cant watch this without thinking ""why does this person have to speak this way"""
It is bad makes the game unbalanced
"​ @W1S3ONE unbalanced is mydei, perma infinite revives, i solo moc 12 with mydei at e2s1 in 5 cycles and e2s1 mydei only took me 100 pulls to get,"
 @yue4405  sure but what about the low spenders or f2p who usually can't afford to pull every character?
" @W1S3ONE  low spenders will have shop reset thats e0s1 guaranteed, as for f2p on average each patch is about 125 pulls, and f2p shouldnt pick random chars to begin with this is for all games, cast e0s1 hits for about 1.6m on average for aoe, her global passive aint useful unless your teams are bottom of the barrel, only chars f2p shouldnt skip is harmony, since you can still clear all content with 0s0 seele with pela and tingyun and rmc aslong as you get 160 speed on pela and rmc and tingyun, which aint hard with 2 piece speed % gear that we got 3 sets of"
"​ @yue4405 the main issue i have with global passives is the predatory nature of it.  fomo taken to new heights, skip this character and not just your favorite team, but every team you own will be missing something"
"@authenticinari-fox8164  its predatory true, but to call it fomo, i dont agree, even more when you can still easily clear moc 12 and pf with units from 1.0 and 2.0 with no issue if you got a brain and actually build your team, i usually help a lot of people i chat with get their e0s1 or express passes so they can always get their chars. Because they enjoy the game. Even show them how to beat using old chars. So they dont have to think fomo"
" @yue4405  ""not fomo""??? sure buddy, are you saying you're gonna skip the chars with global crit dmg, crit rate, spd% too?!
its the literal definition of fomo lol

""you can clear with 1.0 units"" is an equally meaningless excuse for this point, Global passives locked behind premium units IS bad, not matter how shit the passive is to YOU"
" @legolasdf1  and where do you see set global passives, i seen all legit confirmed leaks for next 4 patches, none of them has any global passives, and yea it aint fomo given that crit dmg after 440% increases your dmg by less than 5% and speed?? Aslong as you got over 165 speed on supports and sustain it aint needed, hp? Just shove mydei in the fight he has infinite perma revives, and we dont have any evidence of them making chars with global passive aside from cast"
" @yue4405  You're right idk where they get their information about upcoming characters having global passives, there was no confirmed characters except Castorice. There was a recent leak that says Phainon don't have Global Passive and yet here in youtube everybody saying he has. And also FOMO is not really an issue if you pick and build your characters right."
"@Zek106  they are still slorping on the fake leaks from weeks ago, those were already proven false"
" @Zek106  they are still talking about the fake leaks from weeks ago, those were already proven false. But hey drama vids for them more views"
 @yue4405 It’s one big “trust me bro” moment.
idk why they just didnt make the Global passives free
 @datvictini Money? 😐
"My wallet is closed, I don’t need to swipe, I just save when I know a unit I want is coming up."
 @Osprey1994  and the gameplay will be altered thanks to the other GP characters coming in 3.X. Good on you for not spending but I’m not envious for the coming state of an already unstable game.
​ @datvictini Mr Crabs: MONEY!
"​ @Osprey1994  What if you don't want that character, tho?"
" @Osprey1994  I mean even F2Ps are contributing, however small that contribution may be, to greenlighting the passive, by saving and pulling on the character."
Lack of creativity that they rely on op traits and dmg numbers of character to sell characters. Hoyo is a deadhorse
​ @TxtallyNotKev  just skip
​ @QueenAI-ph1xi  people would have already summoned for castorice just cause of her crazy animations. But this devs just want more money and I guess they are thinking about a future where they don't have to go all out on a new character. Just put a op gp and they will become must have
just pull for it then. next patch gives jades anyway. just cope cause we cant do anything about it
"Do you have to spend money for her? Just play the game and they gave soo many jades from events and all sorts of contents in the game and they gave enough time to farm before her banner ended. I'm f2p so i know the situation.

Stop spending like a crazy gambler if you do not get her, be patient and farm again if you really want her. If you do not want her, then f*ck off."
 @nashrinazali1304  exactly vro
"Spend money to get a limited character? Nah, i get them for free"
If you dont pull her then what? Lose pvp with other people? Cannot clear end games? Skill issue 😂
Each patch we get jades worth 1 character including losing 50l50 unless y'all want all the characters in 1 patch
"How can you be so moronic, to not understand the situation?? IT WILL MAKE THE DEVS CREATE MORE LIMITED CHARACTERS WITH GLOBAL PASSIVE LOCKED BEHIND THESE CHARACTERS IN A FUCKING GACHA, SO PUT THEN ALL GLOBAL PASSIVES TOGETHER AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM, THEN ITS GG, PREDATORY CRAP.​ @apokarin427 "
"well I hope WuWa add global passive in game to Rover yes ""ROVER"", All Player have him and it's FREE. why u ask? well this is KURO :)"
"​ @datvictini Thry can tied it too story. After you finish X story your account got X buff. If we are talking about lore, why not do just that then? Ofc because they want more money :v"
I definitely should been a lot more focused on that.
"Like, at least HI3 gives global passives through FARMABLE divine keys and STANDARD (DORM) characters. This game is doing something worse than that if they make this into a trend from now on, but if they stop at this I can't be too mad about it tbh, just a bit salty about the preferential treatment but realistically it won't impact my experience by that much except in Simulated/Divergent Universe"
"​ @TxtallyNotKev exactly, people say they're fine skipping characters but then sht like global passives on limited 5* characters comes out and welp now you have to pull characters you may not like or miss out on a global buff that will improve your entire account no matter what"
"​ @apokarin427 I'm tired of the mentality of ""why are you complaining it's a pve game bruh 😂"" bitch I pay to pull characters I like, I literally support the game I have every right to complain about what I don't like in a product I pay for, whether it's a one time purchase or a live service"
Just say things become pay to win.
A LIMITED CHARACTER you can SKIP.
Or someone just like the character ever think of that?
"​ @phoenixdrive4931 people pull characters for multiple reasons, trying to strongarm people with fomo by using global passives aint it.  its almost like a vip system, amount spent (on global passive characters) increases overall strength"
"​ @phoenixdrive4931 duh, ofc if someone like her gonna pull her 😂 He saying the one that doesnt like her. The players that save their jade for future characters like Phainon, Hyacine, etc. They dont want castorice but have to pull her for that global passive. Cuz u dont even need to level castorice up. U just need her in your account for the free revive full team 😂 Now why would u need free revive? Cuz future boss will 1 shot you like Nikador 😂"
"​ @phoenixdrive4931 heck, the new dragon boss makes all your units in your team go to 1hp 😂 Balance?  Nah, that's how they sell her."
"I would tell the guy to wink twice if there was a problem. 
But hoyo clearly has the guy as a hostage at 🔫 point while making this video."
"Aside from new players being able to farm from herta station all way to ampho, netting around 120k jade"
"If they play for at least a week getting all the 20 pulls from the daily log in + the 1600 from the anniv rewards and reaching belobog they would atleast have enough for 1 50/50 attempt. But still it will be rough, more so for the casuals who only play an hour a day. Since they wouldn’t have a diverse team and no good relics, unless they get very lucky, but i doubt it."
"​ @yue4405 yeah at what cost. No shower, no grass. Each patch so far has unskippable dialogue even in the side events since 1.0 And the events themselves were dogsht, especially The museum one"
 @Ennryuo  aint that what everyone did on lunch? Lol and you can do half story in 1 weekend alone
" @yue4405  yeah, everyone was blindly eating the sht out of that just to get jades"
​ @yue4405  Are you sure you can stand the black screen and the many words until the ampho without the skip button? If I were a new player I wouldn't be able to stand all that 😂
"@Ennryuo  also people bitch about the global passive yes its shit that there might be more in the future, but thats future we dont have a single char with global passive for next 4 patches, and cast passive aint even good, since a decent player can clear all current content with seele, pela, rmc, tingyun 160 speef on pela, rmc, ting ainy hard with the set bonuses we got now"
"@MasRisKun  eem guess you havent played lol, you can skip most content and can go straight to ampho too"
​ @yue4405  i would rather do belebog and even xianzho loufu rather than ampho. Only reason to do it would be to get RMC
@ashiqprio2485  true on that xD
I feel like her past will be more balanced if you had to have her on your team for the passive to be activated work if it was like that I don't think no one would be complaining that badly
My friend told me I can get a free ruan mei or luocha. She asked me when im coming back to honkai… how do I tell her WUTHERING WAVES FOREVA
Dude was out of breath the entire video. He’s got bigger problems than a gacha
I was not here before the bots sorry baldie
The community doesn’t want to be saved
"video gone private, i wonder why 😂"
"OF COURSE CASTORICE GLOBAL PASSIVE NOT BAD...WHO NOT HORNY WITH THAT CHARACTER.. SO OP!!...EZ GAME, ..PAY TO WIN!!😂😂😂😂😂😂"
Of course it ain't. I didn't plan on having weak teams that die
Wassup Baldy.
Fifth
Dont let Castorice global passive distract you from the fact that Tectone is bald
Can someone tell me what is Castorice Global Passive and why it’s so bad?
😮
First here
first
i think he’s the “big” problem 😂
The HOYO assassin had a garotte around his throat the whole vid
fr fr
Da wai got him 🫡
You’re telling me Hoyo sent Evelyn to choke him out???
Dude is literal mouth breather 😂
"He and FutureCanoe can be a great team, Team No-Energy."
"@ Nah, that I'm pretty sure many people would be honestly happy about experiencing.
The HOYO assassin is a meme from, I forgot his name - a black dude with glasses and dreadlocks, who does various parody skits about Genshin and HOYO. Said CC had, in one of his vids, parodied HOYO creators, where he couldn't speak bad about Genshin because there was a HOYO ninja standing in the corner of his room, watching."
@ You're talking about Cosmos
"Exactly, we can just leave them alone at this point"
And is that remind you of other community? Exactly GI. Both HSR and GI have the same Community
Lol i never feel bad about these fanbases
 @forcodingg1287 it slowly turned to it so now it’s not good to be in the community I will only keep myself with tectone and whatever he covers otherwise I will not be looking at the community I will play the game and enjoy it on the side
Even Tectone's shiny head can't save them smh
"Damn, was hoping to see him get cooked in the comments lol."
Was wondering why I couldn't find the original video 💀
What's his channel name ?
"Idk why they act like death is a bad thing. If you’re gonna get your team killed a lot, I don’t think Castorice is enough to save you, it’s easier and more future proof to fix your teams. But if you would get frustrated quit over 1 or 2 deaths like you ain’t supposed to learn anything then just go play animal crossing or some shit."
Until they add insta death mechanics into the game
"you miss the fact that they release content around the characters.  you didnt need super break until they made content that needed it, you didnt need fua until they released content that needed it.  whats stopping them from releasing content that highly incentives certain global passives"
 @authenticinari-fox8164 The easy boss button for story is right there.
💔
Fr
"grass is green

sky is blue"
"Basically when you pull her(even when not in the team) she can revive someone. The reason it's bad (in the community's eyes) is if this is a success then hoyo will make even more OP global passives in the future Basically making power creep worse plus making it more ""predatory"""
"The passive on castorice really isn't that bad, it just revives a team member that dies, and if you're having sustain issues it's usually just by not building your sustain correctly or failed a mechanic etc. 

However, now that it's there the devs can add any passives they want to future characters, making power creep worse and worse and making skipping certain characters you might not even want also worse as well since you don't have those passives boosting to your account. 

And let's say you skip every passive eventually the game is going to be balanced around you having a few, thats when you're kinda screwed."
"its some passive that can revive your whole team just from having her on your account which is mid since they get put at 1hp and can still die right then and there plus you rarely even die and if you do youre trash tbh, but the bad thing is that its making everyone overthink and assume the future of hsr being people being forced to pull for someone because of a passive which we dont even know if its gonna happen or if theres a limit to passives you have in a fight"
​ @MiStycc  bro's slopping on it
" @Shindy117  the true reason it is bad is because it is hoyo, and the playerbase it has would just keep giving their money to dawei either way and defend this shit practice. and since big playerbase = big revenue, it'll appear as a ""success"" no matter what to outsiders.
down the line, this enshitification might spread to other gacha either new and old, and slowly normalized because these devs (especially cash grap IP gacha's dev) would think gacha players are ""alright"" with this shitty system."
"Using another game as an example, imagine locking phoenix down or raise spells in a unit"
Basically we dont trust the devs to not pull bs bc of the passive
"Honestly I have no problem with sexualisation of characters in games. Sex should be normalised and yet in 2025, it’s still taboo to talk about which is just silly"
"yall be talking about gacha pvp... let me introduce you to COOKIE RUN KINGDOM, THE BEST GACHA GAME TO EVER GACHA"
"to cut short to people who don't wanna waste their exact 1 hour 18 minutes and 54 seconds of their life, the global passive is definitely bad but for Pokke it's not that bad, he claims it should be  free but at the end of the day it's just ""a mere free revive"" so it is still kinda okay to him."
It's all fun and games until the devs decide to start making content (including end game) around passives.
I don’t think the global passive is a big deal when they are kinda giving us a lot of wishes. Now if this becomes a consistent thing it can become worse.
"The 50/50 being a problem I think was a silly critique with it. I definitely think this is a solution to having so many characters to where if I’m going to keep losing 50/50 to random characters, I’d rather lose to a pool of characters I do want, esp copies of. Genshin standards until I quit. I’ve had them all at c6 for a very long time, some were way over c6, some at least c10 or c12. And I’d rather have a pity and ways to use my pull cash backs for at least a character. I got so pissed when I spent a total of 600 wishes for the latest Rapi in NIKKE and all I got was 1 fucking rapi, ONE. I had to use 3 of the coupon vouchers to get 3 more copies, it sucked. I wanted to save those for collab characters like asuka."
"1)
All tech companies have 2 sides: the developers and the shareholders. The latter wants as much revenue as possible and cares about nothing else. The former wants to create products which is used and liked by the users. The DEVS give their souls, blood and sweat to these games. They want us - hopefully all of us - to enjoy the results of their hard works. So they do listen and believe me, they want to give more and listen more but they have bosses Who care about money and deadlines only.
2)
About Castorice: I doubt the global buff will be a trend because none of the upcoming ones have signs of having any, but i they do, it won't harm the game. HI3 has global buffs left and right and it has little impact... Also, her kind of global passive won't be the standard for those globals because she is an anniversary unit. Acheron has instant slay and no one else does. They did get some useful stuff on their technique but not like hers. Castorice will also be one of a kind
3)
Old character buffs: are a thing in HI3 as well. In part 1, old characters (like super old ones) got augment cores you could collect or buy to buff them. They didn't become meta, but they were very usable as supports for the new characters. And each got new skills, new moves, new look... They were not general multilier increases. And now, e.g. Herrscher of Human Ego (who is liked, so is Blade and Kafka) got new life in Part 2 with a new weapon which made her compatible with the astral ring system (and the new one of that) so she can be a support for new upcoming characters.

It is not a coincidence that the first batch of the buffs will come in 3.4... Blade will likely be able to be a good support for Phainon. Or an Alternative right after Mydei. Maybe Kafka will go with Cypher and Seele will go with Castorice...
4)
Monetisation: it's a GACHA GAME. They always wanted people to spend, lol 😅 and in Asia people spend. So hard, some go bankrupt. They let you play free games or have free apps on your phone because they want to push you to spend on a consistent basis instead of one big pay. It is normal (sadly).
5)
They funnel most of the money into sibling companies like that AI company they have... (No it doesn't voice things with AI, they are doing stuff with bigger impact)"
"Why global passive is so bad, coz the main problem is not the passive but  the main problem is that feature they would give to enemy as well, for example in future they make enemy ""if party have buff from characters is not in the battle field enemy resistance will decrease or enemy will doing less dmg"" if that come true, its will be over for old characters"
Very glad Tectone and SMack wasn't a part of this
44:25
why was fob throwing shade at westerners for being against pay to win
"they keep crying about castorice and saying the global passive is predatory, they dont know the meaning behind the word , they might have had a point if the passive was lock behind her e6"
I was not going to quit until global passives. I was not thinking of quiting at all
"This is not what people typically refer to with Hoyo spending events. HI3rd where that originated for Hoyo rewards you for spending currency, not money. F2P can save up when they know one is coming and take full advantage of it as well without spending a dime"
"Speaking of global passive, does anyone actually test or quantify the ""bath mechanic"" and how much buff it gives? Since the game goes out of its way to tell you this."
You can’t run sustainless because YOU HAVE TO BE HEALED OR SHIELDED by ANOTHER character for the revive to work
"Honestly whats the point of playing this game anymore, even genshin needs more strategy than star rail rn and its kinda funny ... Or not"
"Great yap session ngl, o7 Starrail for me personally, has been fun. There are just a lot more issues in HSR than just the powercreep or global passives"
"24:48 It always kinda cracks me up when people make this argument.  The 50/50 system was an initial solution to having NO guarantee for a unit at all (I've heard horror stories about FGO), the 75/25 was an answer to people not liking the 50/50, and the guaranteed weapon banner in WuWa was a way to get a leg up on the 75/25 weapon banner Hoyo was using.  Now, in the case of HSR, the new change to the 50/50 system feels less like a solution to the 50/50 system, and more like a solution to the fact that they have SO many limited 5 star units, and that there are units who will likely not be able to rotate back in fast enough, and they won't be compelling if they received their own rerun banner.

IF a dev chooses to remove the 50/50, they will without a doubt make it significantly more difficult to hit guaranteed pity.  WuWa is a perfect example of this, they have a 100% guarantee on the weapon, but they changed the currency, and they only give you 5 limited pulls during the initial portion of the patch that are locked to the character banner.  This means that any time you roll on the weapon banner, it feels like it's a pretty big choice, and I've personally felt like I'm incentivized to commit to hitting the weapon (This is likely magnified by the 4 star weapons being kinda shit).  

TLDR: The 50/50 into 100% was a solution to an old issue in gacha.  If they move to a guaranteed system we can probably expect pity shifting to something like 160+, or less currency."
They made sure to spoiler the entire story but didn't have time to explain the stuff we were actually there for.
"it is in the sense that it ""forces you"" to pull a unit that you otherwise may have not planned to"
that means high chance other global passives most probably will need a certain threshold for the passives to work
"Its all fun and games until they bust out speed global passives, Crit rate global passives, effect hit chance global passives or even worse, perks that make farming more efficient or whole arse gameplay mechanics.

This is going to snowball out of control if we allow it to become successful, I guarantee it."
Dont need so many complains about the same thing just leave if you dont like the game 🤷‍♂️.
I love cassie global passive
1:17:18 “You’re not the victim here”
"tbh, the global passive thing is something im okay with. there is currently NO team in hsr that relies on revives. bailus revive is barely useful, bailu is just not useful in general, and gepards revive isnt needed in his kit either. in fact, powercrept has slowed down recently, therta ofc being very powerful, but aglaea has restrictions, and so does mydei. and when these more balanced characters come out, people are quick to complain how to make them op is to spend money. i thought we didnt want them to be op? acheron is still useful in every piece of content, and can do very very well, and firefly performs as well as rappa. powercreep is not as doomed as yall claim. performance also depends on enemies, so it still does fluctuate. so many people hated on aglaeas e1 for solving her issue, and to make her broken, and same goes with mydei. so basically, they want a non broken character, but also want them to be broken? make up your mind. (for those that dont know, e1 aglaea solves her energy issues and e1 mydei nakes godslayer be god full aoe.) dont forget the jiaoqiu doomposting when they made him ""weak"" and him being outperformed by pela in some cases. the community also takes part in this."
"I don't think Strinova died because ""the learning curve is too high"" lmao.  It looks like ass so a lot of people never gave it a chance."
"Fob's right, the global passive isn't the end of the game for 99% of people.  It's kinda the straw that broke the camel's back for me personally, my decline started in 2.6 and I've kinda replaced HSR in my rotation already.  But if they improve the story stuff and add end game I care about, I could see myself coming back.  But as is it just kinda feels like a chore more so than fun."
eh its just buisness as usual for a hoyo gacha game and its community at least on the western side some people complain and leave the rest play and enjoy there time playing the game the only ones who truly care about the global passives are the endgame players  which make up a very small perecentage anyway the rest just play the story and farm for the new shiny char till the time comes to replace them with a newer even more shinier on.
UIGUY is the true Gacha Jesus
"i cant wait for speed,crit,attack and continiously debuffing enemies global passives and watch both sides lose their shit"
"hi3rd also has passives, i don’t know what perks they give but if it’s minor then i hope hsr follows that path since it’s basically its child.
Unless hi3rd’s passives are as bad as the speculations made in hsr then welp, at least i know the game will take a hard toll."
"bro if silver wolf ult or E become aoe, she going to be crazy"
"I think the global paasive is something only on anniversary character , just like Acheron is the only character can skip the battle during the map"
ngl its the people that complain about castorice global passive that are 100% gona be the same guys who e2s1 her on release
"I swear the sweaty gacha community (which I am a part of, no shade there) sometimes talks about these games way too seriously. I'm not saying that to dismiss conversation about it, I think this call was pretty insightful. I'm just worried about the people who will get legitimately tilted that GLOBAL PASSIVE or whatever powercreep etc as if hoyoverse walked in and shot their dog. It hurts when stuff you like changes in a way that you dislike but there's so many games out now and upcoming ones with such a similar format that you could just drop this and play something else. I did it with genshin and eventually I will stop playing hsr, and thats okayge."
"i dont understand the issue tbh
if up until now, your characters had good/decent crit rate/crit dmg, why being scared that a gp will make it bad?
if anything, it'll even be a nice bonus

up until now, we've seen the worst of the endgame modes, actual hp inflation, and somehow, we still 0 cycle MoC, and clear PF 40k, so how does adding a few crit dmg/crit rate change this in any way?

these ""buffs"" have been implemented in the game since 1.0 in one slick way or the other.

my main example is fucking FuXuan, she legit gives you a whole 12% crit rate while sustaining you at the same time, while you can't get it while she's off field, you get the point"
"People complaining about Castorice, as if Acheron wasn’t a walking delete button in overworld and The Herta wasn’t a stellar jade finder."
"I think the main problem people are facing is fear of not being able to clear end-game content. HSR end-game is ridiculously easy, and everyone is expecting to be able to clear it without premium units. Does it make a game bad if end-game content isn't fully clearable with minimally invested accounts? Some people have never played HI3 or other gacha end-game. If you didn't have the units/comps, you didn't clear. You just get over it, BUT you could participate and still get rewards. Your account is fine, your game is still playable and enjoyable. You'll live without and extra 100-200 jades.

On a side note, it's amazing to see how ""on-topic"" and fairly rational this is without a certain baldy isn't present. Let alone I didn't need to adjust my volume."
"I'm going to have to say the problem of ""global passives"" didn't begin with Castorice.
It began with Topaz's character technique to find treasure chests and increased currency in the Simulated Universe.
Then we had Ruan Mei's interaction with the Simulated Universe.
Then we had Acheron's insta-kill enemy encounters... she doesn't have to be on your ""combat"" team to have this effect.
Castorice is just the first ""during combat"" global passive.
It's a bit late to get upset about account-buffs like this."
"Watching CCs cry about Castorice fills me with glee 😂

Edit: On a side note, CCs thinking the Relic stats are pre-rolled when you get thr artifact is kinda funny 😂"
"I mean yeah obviously, they tried to make the game more interesting or more appealing. Honestly thought i dont feel bad at all im getting bored by playing the same team comp with same support"
"@RaihanSalim-nw7tm  Erm...no.

This is purely to fill their pockets and create scenario's where people feel like they HAVE TO summon for units that are going to have these.

Thats why its awful for the game."
" @arcadius3257  well thats your opinions. Hsr is way too simple imo i dont find it enjoyable doing all those side quest farming su for jade or whatever just to pull regular build doing the most boring turn base game ever. I remember when i was playing E7 pve content it was much more enjoyable they make you explore every gear build, team, finding the right buff and debuff etc. that's why i always open for new stuff because i just hope from this they can make the game more interesting like adding abys floor challenge or whatever. the first Gold SU and the swarm su was good the rest was dogshit."
" @RaihanSalim-nw7tm  No, its a fact.

You're just painfully naive."
" @arcadius3257  In order for something to be considered a fact, it must be supported by verifiable evidence and generally accepted as true. Being an auditor myself being skeptical is a must but what you do here is just baseless accusation on your view and even if what youre saying is true this game company it's not some non profit organization:D . If you refuse to hear what other people think then you shouldn't commented in the first place."
Noone cares. If you dont like the game just quit youre some grown ass man crying about gacha game😂
"@RaihanSalim-nw7tm And there is.

Gaming history, I know you newbies all started during Covid with Genshin impact but Gaming has existed far longer than that bud.

We've been through this song and dance countless times, fools like you only realize your mistake when its far too late."
"@smasdsee5046 Nahh, I think i'll continue pissing off fanboys like you with valid criticism."
"@ You cared enough to respond.

Doofus."
" @arcadius3257  if theres some point when i dont having fun then im just going to quit the game its not that deep. Its honestly intriguing why people trying to leverage company decision like its some type of investment. Glad i was born asian i guess🤷🏻

Edit: i saw you have more than 200+ coments in this channel i guess it wasn't ethnicity,  you just a keyboard warrior. In where i came from we call you 失败者 (shībài zhě) a parents mistake"
" @RaihanSalim-nw7tm  So you have no retort whatsoever.

Got it."
"​ @arcadius3257 I mean, neither do you? All of your comments towards them featured some kind of personal attack lmao"
" @justsomeguy727  What do I need to retort?

The argument they don't have?"
"Definitely will happen in time. CN fanbase is the type that will just accept anything given to them, so it will happen."
 @backpackpepelon3867  Yep
"And people like you are the reason why Genshin Impact never got better.

Because you don't criticize whats bad about the game."
@arcadius3257  ahh yes I said don't complain instead right? What's the point of complaining now when it's ady a thing? I get the complains before but now that's global passive is a thing why are those things crying so much about it.
" @carrot6551  Thats not what you said doofus, you're literally telling people to leave if they don't like what the game is doing."
"@ You literally told people to leave if they don't like what the game is doing.

Why are you lying? lmao"
@arcadius3257  they ady made the global passive. Why hate it so much? Instead of continuing the complains just leave instead like the ccs. Yall make it like a gacha game shouldn't have power creep and new abilities.
" @carrot6551  They took too serious into the gaming world into their lives over their heads. It's their favorite game.That's why the outcry.. They felt their time is taken for granted. Then again, games are created to die. It's just a question of when. So get a grip. it's not like you cant pull for characters either, it is AN OPTION. Not an obligation. Honestly, Hoyoverse didnt even take a knife out and force u to literally pull for that character. 

As a F2P, no doubt, you gotta plan your pulls well. You aren't going to get all the characters that you wanted. (The same analogy, we can't have all the nice things in life without a cost)

I seriously question the minds for this outcry. On the side note, I already saved up 250 pulls just for Castorice. :face-blue-smiling:"
"The passive just helping add few score to help raise the rank against player with same comp and skill. Aside from that, it does not have effect."
"imo, the best way i can describe this gp of a thing is, it's like consuming a food buff, but this time it actually follows you into every endgame mode"
"Yeah, i dunno why people choose to complain now of all times? ""Hoyo makes it that Castorice is a must pull"". Even without a global passive, I will still pull for her and the gp isn't the thing i sought from her. I'm confused as to why people are getting mad over a global passive now. It's not even a full revive. If you think that with the GP, they can go in without a sustainer. They are so wrong. The kit requires you to get a heal or shield to fully revive, else they would get taken down as well after 1 turn.

I do think GP is the thing that triggers them while the problem they are addressing has been present since v1.x patch of HSR."
acheron's global passive is way more important than castorice's
"GachaSmack on Aglaea banner: Made a whole vid glazing Casto and telling Aglaea was mid and totally not worth. Stated that Casto will be a powerhouse yadda yadda

Casto arrives, IS a powerhouse, but is shaping to be the most controversial character because of global passive

GachaSmack: I quit HSR, bye

LOL"
As a casual player I dont care about Castorice Global Passive... not sure how other casuals feel about it.
IT'S A PVE GAME NOT A PVP GAME WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT HER GLOBAL PASSIVE
"I’m staying because I like the story/lore and Herta! This is a freaking single-player game. If they can make more powerful characters then go! Give me more challenge. I’m still salty about Nikador boss killing me so many times (I lack sustain characters) so thank you Castorice for saving my azz soon lol. Give me Aventurine next and/or Hyacine then I’m good to go. 

Genshin community was all about: “Oh the game is so easy, combat sucks”. Meanwhile HSR community: “Game is so hard,  p2w! Need to pull meta hero to beat the game!”. So like, can y’all shut up? Casual players like us don’t care. Why would I play a game with low qual and weak heroes? Doesn’t make sense. 

P.S. idgaf if you tourists will call me “hoyoslave”. Cope harder 🥱😛"
"guys HSR doesn't have powercreep, i'm serious, ya'll just imagining it"
"58:00 As an obsessive Danganronpa fan, I appreciate the Tribe Nine hype!"
"If Castorice is the hidden free 5-star, then the new global passive mechanic won't become a p2w trap. However, that would literally change the immersion. Players in the pre-Amphoreus story would either experience it when it shouldn't appear yet (if everyone gets it), or will lag behind others in terms of completing challenge modes (if she's locked behind story progression). Either way, I see nothing good with global passives. I'd rather not think if we have more characters with global passives."
"FGO anniversary gives 300+ pulls and 5* selector,  Dokkan battle gave this year 200+ pulls and a 5* selector which INCLUDED THE NEW ANNIVERSARY CHARACTERS. MASSIVE W. 
Imo instead of just having a choice b/w blonde guy and ruan mei, they should've given a choice between all 5 stars before 3.0"
"Imo, global passives are a good thing but should've been locked behind the main story completion instead of locking it behind a character but in general I reaaly don't care about it but i guess its a non west take"
Idk who bro coming from behind the door is but he’s malding hard as fuck the entire time and made this so annoying to watch
Fab is so annoying and out of touch he has this superiority complex because he is from china or whatever asain culture he is from and tht mindset that the route that star rail is taking is a “non issue” because it is only vocalized by the “minority” is projected onto the rest of the space which is unfair to everyone else
Aeon of 1% Silently Aura Farming for 99% of the entire time
Finally wuwa add some personality
i cant stand it when cc's act like you should be able to clear endgame content when they are tourists of the game with trash relics
"Some toxic people will quit hsr and play wuwa, comes to wuwa community and toxic there if at the time wuwa dev wont listen to some players suggestion. I mean yeah, gacha game is also company where there are people who want to make money. Of course at some time, they will make a featured where people forced to pull or spend the money rather if they like it or not."
"i was away from gacha games for a while bcs of MHwilds. also quit one of my gacha daily games bcs of that game. now that i'm back in here in the gacha CC space i realize it's nice to see everything stayed the same. the narrative i've seen is the same, hoyo bad and wuwa is still hailed as the dev listened game. and my stance is the same, all gacha game is kinda bad. these gacha games are the same. what matters is which game you actually enjoy and how much bullshit they do you can tolerate."
As hoyo will unlikely will change or remove global passive. My last hope is they restricted active global passive to only 1 😢
"The short version of the global passive is. This one in specific isolated from other things, doesn't matter it basically doesn't change the gameplay. The Problem is with the design space this opens up. What's to prevent Hoyo from adding a global passive that does matter, hell I can totally see them adding one akin to the special abilities we get on some fights and they'll sell it as we heard you you need more depth and more buttons so now you can press T and the enemies go boom like it's TnT"
"ngl at the point where they compare sw to anaxa for the n-th time i can't help but wonder if these people know anything about the game
and since they don't seem to then idk why should i take any of their takes seriously"
Easiest conclusion: You’re not Chinese
He is crazy
Mans stood on business. Most of these people can't say the same thing.
I honestly don't really care every gacha game is pay to win in my eyes in some way there will be predatory stuff in it
" @wessie_btw6751  As a casual, it is pretty bad ngl all points made are valid but why do ppl act like it killed their whole family? In the end of the day it’s a game, i have other stuff to worry about in life."
"Casual player as well here picking up 5 star men characters! I don't really care much about castorice, but I do understand that others might feel pressured to pull for her because of her pas. I do feel the same way with pulling for harmony characters to help support the team, though almost all are girls, and I'm collecting men, but I just ignore and save up for what I want. :)"
You need to use your brain. It fundamentally makes the game more predatory than it already is. Just think. You can do it.
"Regarding FGO, been playing since day 1 of the JP server so I can tell it took YEARS (can't remember exactly how many but probably 5 or 6) before they even gave out a STANDARD 5* selector, anniversary stuff never gave limited 5* and the ceiling for a limited 5* is at 330 pulls. Please never compare HSR to that stupid game regarding the gacha mechanics, sure HSR has its flaws but it's still infinitely better than FGO.

Fun fact, in the beginning FGO 10 pulls didn't even have a guaranteed 4*, cost 33% more than now and there was no ceiling for years."
"@Xophien   I understand everything you say, I am a day 1 player in fgo and HSR is far better than it when it comes to summon pity and the frequency of getting 5 stars but even you have to admit that fgo anniversarys are far better than HSR ones"
" @literallyjesus7232  Lately they clearly are, yeah, but I went to check, and on FGO's second anniversary we only got the equivalent of 50 pulls (still talking about jp server, don't know if it was the same in global), and only because they retroactively increased the rewards from the tutorial (otherwise it was just 20 pulls). 
Don't get me wrong though, I'd love at least enough pulls for a guaranteed in HSR (80), but unfortunately, really popular gacha games are always stingy until their popularity decline, like FGO… And seeing how Genshin is still stingy as hell after 5 years, I've lost all hope 😮‍💨
(also, it's easier to give out pulls when the ceiling is so high, since it makes them lose less money in the end)"
"I don't think it's toxic to give constructive feedback. In fact devs literally ask for this and thank people for it. And if any company ever pushes it too far, then good on the player for leaving. That isn't toxic, that's responsible"
Shit up wuwa shill. ​ @GodofGoblins 
"Idk why people are so worked up over this global passive stuff. The game is not a pvp game. it's a single-player game,it won't affect everyone, only the one that plays her. in my opinion,i dont hate nor like it,im neutral about this..."
Id like to think that Penacony is the end of HSR and everything that comes after is Boruto.
"One of the livestream topic that didn't stick out in the spotlight is the animation, the devs said that they'll start putting in character trailers level animation in the game which is a good thing imo. Almost feels like in Hi3rd again"
Holy Content Yapenning
"this looks to me like a change in hoyo's monetization strategy it seems like the silicon valley strategy of building a service that starts of user friendly to gather users then slowly increases costs and clamps down and becomes less user friendly, a good example of this is netflix that started with low subscription fee's and didn't do much about account sharing, however they slowly started to increase the fee's and clamped down on stuff like account sharing."
"You guys are waaay too optimistic about the crums we got from this livestream... This was litteraly nothing, the rewards were nothing/powercrept, the story changes are a little too late because they waited for their company to go on fire and the buffs on old units, we got no info on that, they just droped that they are buffing them to keeps us hooked. Oh lets not forger Castorice haha"
"people who think castorice global passive is useful in endgame content are just weird, theres no way ur gonna ever need that revive. (Let's be real, unless you have skill issue you won't have problems with dying) 
The only thing im afraid of is follow up attack type global passives or the ones that buff your stats entirely. 
Im pretty sure hoyo knows what they're doing (i wanna believe it, they will understand their mistake by themselves) they might wanna add extra menu in team customization that lets you choose which global passive to run for each team. This menu will be available if you more than 1 character that has global passive"
Its crazy how oyu can have a normal convo about the game without Baldies going schitzo on how genshin ate their cat and stole their wife
"I was there when this conversation happened. Twitch was fine and funny, but Pokke's YouTube livestream chat was so toxic, literally. Even his YouTube mods were telling them to ""bahave"" but nothing changed."
"It's actually insane that people are defending global passives. Casual or not it does not make it remotely okay? I only play 2 gachas and I'm very casual when i do play. This is not okay for casuals either. If i can't get matts, do side quests or events because the game is designed to force you to make purchases, it is not worth my time. Same thing applies to literally any purchase and thinking it won't have a big impact is crazy"
"it is just funny when CC play 3 hoyo games and give good compliment about it while still enjoy Wuwa and give good compilment, still called Hoyo shill. soon Kuro fans gone become toxic as hoyo fans its just like time bomb, or mybe they already it just denial about that."
"The passive tbh is completely useless especially for casual not only she revives you with 1 hp but also it's completely pointless cause casual players plays with sustains so if you die with it it's literally skill issue and since she needs a healer regardless the complains are understandable only if you're worried that there will be other global passive that could be better than this one.The passive could be decent for 0 cycles purpose but if the enemy kills you and has a second action for example that 1 hp revives will be useless either way.she's only good vs 5 enemies and in gimmick fights like flame reaver,her boss,tv,and nikador other than that She's an easy skip."
"Future of HSR is just a future with whales, probably. Casual players like me RIP."
I feel like the castorice passive isnt that bad . Ussualy if you die its cuz the ai targetted the same character 4 times in a row which rarely happens but if they add something like an hp or attack boost its over.
This was fun to experience live because it was fun watching pokke not paying attention while scrolling and laughing at the CN comments while everyone was just yapping about blablabla 😂
As someone eho has played mobile gacha for 15 years ive played mobile games like hsr where players were spending 1k a day on game i personally had a friend spend 50k in one day on the game like it was stated earlier its  cultural differences global buffs isnt bad at all to be real especially in a  single player game
E2S1 castorice
"to bring up Lily's point with reward powercreep, Dokkan Battle's 10th anniversary just allowed us to grab one of the 6 headlining summonable units for free right before implementing a new endgame event that powercrept the rest of the game. Something that should be counted is that the more generous companies become with rewards, the more challenging and engaging the endgame content becomes in order to maintain an increased spending incentive."
"Do not touch my mom Cantarella and Wuwa, the best game ever in my opinion, the world is just a masterpiece"
"Those Chinese dev yap too much during livestream. But they won’t yap during sex. If you seen most Asian porn, you know…. 😂 silent af."
"This is what ive been saying, like what, this is a story based game not a competitive one... It's better this way that they just quit and not complaining anymore, so annoying"
" @batmanzzz  because why play the game if not for the story/ endgame, if they are going to ruin the endgame by adding in these pay to win things into the base characters (obviously whales are going to  be broken). Then what's the point of it."
 @robertlaidlaw4592  If you think that than the end game is already pay to win as pulling new characters in general makes it easy. 99% of content in the game is not pay to win though.
"It makes the game more predatory than it already is, and encourages other gacha games to be even more predatory. Essentially if they pull this off, this leaks into other gacha games easier, creating more situations of absurd power creep and must pull situations, thus creating more psychological pressure to players to spend more money. 





And companies hope you are oblivious to all of this or make excuses. As long as you stay ignorant, you're basically spreading your cheeks for them, even if you don't spend a dime. If you respond with another excuse or dismissal, you only further my point. Just keeping it real."
 @robertlaidlaw4592 the game is already P2W?????
"@GodofGoblins  im not saying we should encourage this kind of thing. I know it's not good for the game and that companies want the money,like any other company. The game is a gacha,of course, it's predatory, and every gacha is predatory in their own way after all...I like the global buff that castorice has but I won't like it if every character from now on will have a global buff..it will be a disaster for the game,everyone knows that...I'm not defending the game nor the company btw..."
"@WhiteHollow Well you are. By saying things like ""well itsnot a pvp game"" or ""well it wont effect anyone"" you are making excuses for the company. You say things like it would be a diaster for the game and everyone knows that? No, everyone doesn't know that. I lost count on how many make excuses and are completely fine with it, getting ready to pull for her or saying its completely fine, etc. 

Basically, anytime you say to belittle the situation, you are subconsciously spreading your cheeks for these companies. Its a practice that can and will fundamentally make gacha games even more predatory than usual, and you respond with ""why are people worked up, its not pvp."" That, to me, comes off as ignorance. Just keeping it real"
The animation does not lag because of it which I like.
"This is nothing new, just take a look at GGZ or Honkai Impact 3. People just didnt listen when warned and continued degenerate behaviour of spending money on e6s5 characters."
What are you and this Cc talking about? What changes Hoyo ACTUALLY did? Examples pls.
Are the comments being deleted? Lmao
"​ @GerriFuryman  global castorice passive, spender event, duplicate e6 shop"
 @ninja666gaming  And where is MONETIZATION CHANGES?
"​​ @GerriFuryman monetization strategy not monetization, they are making spending more advantageous so people spend more money at the expense of f2p and new players especially so a change in monetization compared to when they previously tried to get new players to play and then spend through stuff like the express pass and nameless honor"
"@ WHO FKING CARES? No one who cant spent before will never spent now, no one who was buying shit before will stop doing this. i cant...."
I saw someone running double sustain (fuxuan+gal) on a jingyuan team for the “no character defeated” star the other day so yeah people are that skill issue
"@bop8370  yes, and yet somehow during 3.2 stream everyone in chat was spamming ""yup, I'm uninstalling hsr"" Like it really does matter for someone"
They're absolutely equally as bad and in denial yea. You can tell by the fact a vast majority of them can't even talk about wuwa without also mentioning hoyo. It reeks of inferiority complex.
lol cringe
Look's like harem simulator to me tho
"@kmzwanabe4683  lol not for me, I haven't seen a date in the game yet. But I would like a date with Cantarella, she is beautiful"
the problem isnt about how strong the passive is its about the fact that more passive like this (even more powerful) will be coming out soon
"The only issue with the global passive is the precident it sets for other characters, maybe having a global passive, castorices revive is functionally useless for any competant people 

And also box2s statement on hoyo games only getting worse is just stupid, every patch all lf the games get better par genshin because of certain un added mechanics, but literally the whole box2 statmenet was purely based off of genshin

And it's annoying when people say hoyo as if there aren't different teams and team leads working on each game 

The only time when the game will be woreying is if they add a global passive that increases stats/ the game gets to the point where these passives are required, but there is no proof of any other global passives yet"
hsr finally have 0 player on 3.2 and eos immediately!!!!
"I think it's my time to go back and play real games again, the game feels so lifeless nowadays. I hope it will get good again any time soon, because I used to love this game, but now it feels so dry. I'll stay a little bit for DoT revival"
Imagine dying guys
The thing is with Mandarin is a few words can describe a whole chunk of info. ^^ Hence the subtitles fly the way it does 😅
i have no issues with jenazad. but why would the convo be lead by someone who already dont enjoy the game and consider quitting already.
i wonder what will happen when EU's premium currency removal policy takes effect .
funny how only hsr and genshin gather this cc. what a powerful indeed 😂
"im a little concern to continue this game. but, hopefully in the future patch, they will improvise the game, especially for those who understands the risk of the global passive. as an asian player, i felt sorry for the western players that have to reconsider to spending or top up in the game. hopefully, the devs will listen to all the consumer as they say, and they will fixing the system that make the players satisfied from their QoL"
"I think the irony of it is Fob saying the minority opinion doesn’t matter, is the most American thing a person can say. Fob is the true westerner"
"I think the point is how often will they pump out global passives. If it is once per year like an anniversary unit like castorice, I think it is fine since it will give players ample time to prepare for them. If the timespan is one or two patch in between, the players are pretty cooked. It probably also won't do them any good to give the fates collab characters global passive since once they're gone they're gone for good. I still think it's too early to start doomposting but HSR could still course correct by not making global passive units very rare."
"The first passive EVER in HSR is technically Acheron. Acheron is an anniversary character. Therefore, I think that every anniversary character will have a global passive. Still, there are lines. One is that you DO NOT change combat values. Secondly, MAKE IT BALANCED. Castorice passive isn't that bad, because any action the character takes makes them die. Keep this trend going."
For me the global passive won't even matter bc I don't suck at the game and can use my brain. Also single player game lol👍
Goodbye HSR o7. It was a nice ride.
just let sweetily talk :face-blue-smiling:
Watch hoyo pull the ultimate d*ck move by locking a global passive behind eidolons 😂
CCs that are quiting hsr have been waiting to quit for months they're just using the global passive to make martyrs of themselves.
People Crying and the Game is a Single player game 😂
"I think it is OK if
1) In each major version, only 1 or 2 characters have Global Passives;
2) All Global Passives will not affect combat values (e.g. CRIT RATE, CRIT DMG);
3) Only ONE Global Passive is activated in a single battle."
sometimes we have to atleast one people who not glazing the games
"eh, but his opinion is already skewed towards the negative before the livestream. it's better suited to someone neutral.. only mr. pokke is actually glazing here. jen pushes so hard on the negatives, fob ignores the issue. brax or sweetily wouldve been better leading this convo"
 @poliwb1  well ig you’re right
because hes unbearable
"also, im also get burden because of this powercreep and spending money stuff. that doesnt mean im mocking or discriminating the western players. i also suffered because of the system"
"Don't wait for that, how much they have been saying we will do this in 2 to 4 patches, that's just being strung along."
in a way hes more western than western ccs
Bye tourist!
"​ @frappuchieno  not a tourist. Played since day one. Thousands spent. Was main gacha. Keep coping pleeb, unless you are a new player I congratulate your honeymoon phase."
good for them its unhealthy to talk about the game that you already start to hate every single time
This. Every content creator that is quitting has already been whining about the game for the past few months. It is refreshing to see them leave.
"If 'Global Passive' wasn't functional in endgame, it'd be fine. That's it. Moving the goal post is why they're able to do this"
" @destinystriumph1573  let's be honest here for a second, the way Castorice's passive works it is basically useless unless you have a sustain and it's an accidental death or bad RNG death. I replay the endgame quite often and I can count on my hand how many times that would have actually helped me. And going sustainless is basically for very tunned accounts with hundreds of hours invested on it already so its effects is also pretty low, if you die and ressurect in a sustainless team, something is already missing and it's a reset anyway.

The precedent is the problem. But again, even if all Western players unistalled HSR yesterday they would just stop marketing it in the west and be done with it as the Asia market basically is who makes the real money. And unless a miracle happens the asian community will not give a shit about it."
"​ @destinystriumph1573  This. Characters like Ruan Mei and The Herta technically already has broken global passives in map and SU since SU was never meant to be balanced and we can switch teams and characters whenever we want. If the devs added one line saying ""Castroice's passive does NOT apply in MoC, PF or APOC"" it would've been fine, even somewhat underwhelming. It's the fact that her global passive affects the endgame content that makes it unfair. It's basically the devs saying ""we can implement more broken enemies that will certainly make use of your global passive""."
Only MC should have a Global passive since he/she is universal
"2) is a yikes, buddy. One of the Amphoreus characters global passives leaked. Speed +5% and crit rate +10%. 😅"
 @milmil5350  ​ Any source? I can read Chinese and no CN leaker & Uncle leak that.
" @milmil5350  wait, who said that? I don't find any leakers & Uncle said that."
"Limited 5 Star Saber with Global Passive Skill [Avalon] giving your entire team massive healing per turn.

Calling it now."
"People complaining about the global passive are ignorant, the people who are fearmongering about this having a cascade effect onto other gachas are even more ignorant.

1. Other gachas already have various bonuses reliant on pulling more characters and/or more dupes of characters that impact both direct combat and other important system interactions as well as resource acquisition (Which is still direct power in many of these games as more resources = more Resin spent on farming gear = stronger characters). People who are attributing this as a ""Hoyo special"" are literally by definition tourists. (Hi, Brax, etc)

2. The bonus is nearly irrelevant for a supermajority of the playerbase. If you already max star clear the content, you still will, with or without this. If you are struggling to clear content then pulling powerful units to actually use on your teams and/or vertically investing into units you already own Eg; Robin, Ruan Mei, Sunday, etc. Is going to give you more power for pull than this global passive. If you aren't a whale then gacha games are a resource management sim for even your pulls. Here's the fun part though...

3. If you really think Casto global passive is so incredibly broken, pull her. Anyone who's been saving since the announcement of her global passive has the ability as a 100% F2P player to guarantee her. No one cares if you do or don't like her, you don't have to have her on your team so if anything that should be a bonus to you. I don't like plenty of the annoying af characters in this game and wish I could remove them from my account. But look at that, every time I go into my character list Sampo is still there (Ratio, if you want a 5* example, but I don't mind him).

4. Gacha games are by definition P2W. You want to know what else is P2W in HSR? Literally everything. From the resources used to build your characters, to dupes of your characters and their lc/dupes of lcs to we even had packs that let you ""buy Relics"" via buying the packs with Dice in them and such. Complaining about this specifically when stuff that is generally accepted is way more of a ""problem"" such as E0 vs E6 performance disparity just makes anyone not addressing all these ""problems"" seem ignorant. In my opinion the Dice packs and such were WAY more of a problem, because yes, you had extra Resin top-offs via spending but Relics still felt like one of the ways that you couldn't just ""whale to win"" (Obv, again, Resin refills kind of fit this bill, but it felt less egregious).

TL;DR: Casto passive isn't a big deal, anyone losing their mind over it (Gachasmack -- who also seems to be confused just like Brax about the fact that these systems have always existed in gacha games) was just looking for a reason to quit anyway. PS: I think HSR is in a terrible spot, but Casto passive has nothing to do with that."
"what Fob said is true regarding asian player but he mentions HoK and the stat increase for skin is literally the same with every skin, he makes as if it's so crazy and gamebreaking lmao"
"@4:08 Does he even play any other gacha games? Pretty much in gacha games this has been done long before HSR. Just take a look at HI3 for example, the divine key system. Divine keys give bonus ""passive"" to all your characters. And to get divine keys, you have to gacha. HSR doesn't have rankings system, so I don't think passive would matter much."
"Like guys, not to be a hater. What Jena, Bracs and Smack have in common? They all suck up to Tectone and are mirroring his schizo mindset, where they base their arguments on ""what the worst thing could happen?"" They didn't even realize before this call that 90%of HSR players do not care about the implications of global passives. And people, even the smallest mi nority, are believing their narrative. Thats ridiculous. 

We should critize companies for their bad and predatory practices. But these loudest CCs are so out of touch besides Fob, it is insane. Worrying about future is okay, but what all they do is doompost and hate on the HSR(not to defend it here) based on their worst imaginary fears."
"People talk big about being ""outraged"" about the global passive. At the end of the day sales is what will truly determine hoyoverse's decision.

I somewhat doubt many of these people up in arms doomposting will actually skip Castorice because of the global passive, which is the biggest way they could speak out or show they don't like it."
Pokke have 11 managers. Is he even a gamer or just an actor?
FOB is such a goat LMAOOOOOO
"Remember, don't be greedy and stupid. Dawei needs his new 76th mansion."
"honestly super sad to see ppl exaggerate this. people who only play hoyo games have no idea how bad diablo immortal is... wartune.. and like 1000 other gacha games. its like ppl who always get 10 star steak complain that the steak might come with side orders that dont effect the game in any meaningful way, but they exist. all they talked about is speculation, and acting like their single player game might allow ppl who already e6 all characters might get 1 worthless global passive."
Saying that Hoyo created the 50/50 problem isn't doing them justice cus the problem we had before was that there was absolutely no guarantee that you would get anything.
stopping people from dying is fine... its just that hopefully only this type of passive gets added
"no way jenezed thinks nobody wants seele blade or fu xuan, they are adding to it too they are just the beginning lol"
"You guys do not understand how good global passive is, my co workers are so happy when I told them, because ""Now I can safely autoplay right? I hope they add something like followup even when character is not there, so I can clear boss faster"""
"they never would have given anaxa the global passive because he is male and people would be angry that a male is a must pull, it only works because it is a female. but now that the box is open i hope for future gremlins and males to all have global passive so the waifu puller understand why it was stupid to support glöbal passive :D"
"The thing is people can trashtalk genshin, but a 5 star in genshin is much more worth then a 5 star in HSR. So it really doesn´t matter if i can get blade or seele or luocha if they aren´t good anymore"
Global passive wouldn’t be that much of a problem if they just prevented it from being active in endgame content. And if devs really want it make it so castorice has to be on one of your two teams
"Penacony was overmarketed compared to the current anniversary, so it is understandable that the hype of HSR this year feels lower.  HSR management could have reserved the marketing funds for Fate this year.

Also, no Da Wei."
"who cares for fuxuan, seele or blade at this point I rather lose to himeko -.-"
"Bro i swear to god I thought box2 was agsu and I swear to God, I was bouta lose my shit."
Smack really be farming at this point ngl
​ @viabhavgulati5474 this is literally not about how good that passive is. It's the fact that they ignored all feedback and added it and will 100% do it again. Plus this has nothing to do with other games because we aren't playing those games idk why you're comparing.
So if the passive as bad as you say why tie it to a character and not make it global for everyone
"1. Proof? I want proof.

Name 3 gacha games that has global passive characters.

2. The passive effect itself isn't the issue, it's ""global passives"" and what it means for the future of the game. No one but hardcore players care about endgame, most in my opinion are casuals. Bet, max clear MoC 12 with 1.0-1.6 characters.

3. If you think having a free 1 time revive per fight for all your current and future teams is incredibly broken, pull her. Wdym ""If you think""? 

They announced her full kit yesterday, idk why you think a F2P player can guarantee (28,800 jade) pull her with a 12 days heads up. F2P players can pull one 5 star every patch if they lucky or every other patch if not.

4. Okay let me get this straight, so your saying gacha games are P2W but creator's that don't address these ""problems"" (P2W elements) in a gacha (P2W) game are ""ignorant""... bruh, its a free to play game of course the monetization is egregious, that doesn't mean its okay to add another manipulate practice.

Also an E6 character are powercrept by newer unit every patch. Global passives are a boon your your entire account forever. 

TL;DR: This is not for the benefit of the player, and we all need to push back on it beause you aka the player deserve better."
They hate castorice and get jealous because she got global buff than their favorite waifu
"​ @AaAldi-vr3fe  A lot hate hoyo setting the precedent, not necessarily the character itself. Even those that like Castorice like r/CastoriceMains are skeptical, because a global account-boosting passive could very well end up on a character that people don't like in order for Hoyo to boost those banner sales. It's just a bad precedent to set."
" @fredxu99  global buff is not necessarily needed, if we can clear content without global buff then what's the problem? Global buff doesn't lock certain content"
This makes it kinda scuffed then cuz sales data will be skewed from the top up event
"@AaAldi-vr3fe  when they start balancing around it, it becomes a problem. Too early to tell atm of course and sure Castorice's isn't needed to clear the endgame, but we said the same thing about pocket supports and signature lightcones and eidolons, and now the game's content is pushing a difficulty level that starts to demand those things."
​ @AaAldi-vr3fe the thing if it's not a problem why make it global or why tie it to a character they could make it when she is in the team or give it to everyone not people that have castorice being tie to a character makes it fomo so people have to pay to get a character they may even not like
its his job tho. if he doesn’t have manager how tf he will do with all these guides and stuff
Hes a streamer
"btw saying Hoyo games only downgrade sounds absolutely crazy to me. HSR 2.0 was much better than 1.0, ZZZ is much better than when it launched, even Genshin is getting a little better recently (though it probably couldn't be worse with 4.8 and the style shift in 5.0)"
" @spirit_nightingale9793  All these ""gacha"" cc and players are not gacha players. They play 1 hoyo game and call themselves gacha player. Like for real, if they remove 50/50, but guarantee still at 180 pulls, would that make it better? 50/50 should not be the focus, but the pull income and how many characters you ""need"" to play the game."
 @kurniawandelima  these gacha players have never played pjsk…
"Yep, they should add a global passive that allows you to skip the battle entirely."
"​ @komodo7044 you gonna be surprised by the real casual that spend a lot of money on it, in asia you can see a lot of ppl play hsr on train or at work, do that happen in the west?"
 @komodo7044  cough2x zzz already have that
"​ @komodo7044  they already did, it's the thing called Acheron"
"I mean this isn't must pull either, the passive is pretty useless outside of making sustainless 0 cycle ever so slightly easier. Since I absolutely do not want to pull hyacine I'm leaning towards skipping cas she'll not stay long in the meta anyways with her BiS team releasing back to back and being an HP scaler (and I'm sure Cyrene in 3.7 or so can be used for others as well if it's a RMC upgrade)"
Waifu puller still wouldn’t care.
 @doughnaught8284 I deeply hope waifu pullers skip a must pull because of stupid balance and can’t clear to get jades for the next cycle of must pull waifus
"​ @doughnaught8284 Oh in CN they would care.
Hoyo is terrified of making good male characters, because everytime they do, CN starts crying that they now ""have to pull"" for a male character."
Nah it’s cuz he’s not Phainon. If Phainon is bricked then yeah. Male characters will always be bricked.
.................what? lmao
Atleast HSR is not locking exploration behind 300$ characters
 @Ayush-kc2vx such a bad take
 @TenthOfChaos  it's not a bad take its facts
 @Ayush-kc2vx  explain
 @TenthOfChaos  what is there to explain?
 @Ayush-kc2vx  explain how it’s not a bad thing
​ @Ayush-kc2vx well that isn't happening why are making shit up
​ @Ayush-kc2vx u dont need the mary sue to climb or jump in genshin lmao
 @CosmicSongstress  i think you don't play genshin 🫥. Cuz exploring some parts are a real pain unless you have certain characters
I don’t think you can even do it well on end game content .. especially with bosses like Hoolay or Nikador who have AoEs and high speed. You need to get healed or shielded for the character to get back on their feet and get their hp back.
Fuxuan is really good though
"dont cry that it is ending, smile that it happened."
"Hoyo has already done global passives. HI3 has them, some are grindable and some are gacha. All of them are pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things and they are not required for endgame."
mr pokke exposed :( fake gacha player
I think this is something that should be shamed and no content creator should be covering this game anymore. The community needs to let this game die now as they can't change it when it goes live due to laws. If it doesn't expect this even to come to WuWa and maybe tweaked for slight praise but still predatory.
"I don't think it is accurate to theorize Hoyoverse skipped quickly past the global passive because too few people care. Hoyo is being very cautious with the global passive. They didn't address it in detail, they put it on a character that will already be pulled instead of Anaxa where it would be more obvious, and they didn't make it a very strong passive. If they are confident there will be absolutely no backlash, then why be so conservative in how they add it?

It's the same argument with them buffing older characters. Kafka and Jingliu are popular waifu characters sure. Who are these casual Silver Wolf mains who were wanting a buff? Where are these casual Blade mains, who are somehow in touch enough to know their character needs a buff but disconnected enough to not recognize a global passive problem?

If you want to treat casuals as truly braindead swipers who couldn't care less, then the only changes Hoyo should be making are the story changes. Any combat or meta changes truly shouldn't matter. Casuals will just always buy the new characters and there wouldn't be a need to buff the old ones."
"i dont know why people complaining. This is a SINGLE PLAYER GAME, you don't compete with anyone, global passive means nothing."
"if you play long enough, having to spend 1-2 extra cycles to clear endgame content because u dont have a ""broken global passive"" (we arent even there yet all this drama over a REVIVE passive sheesh) isnt a big deal... the loud ones are probably the ones who just barely get 3 stars or believe you need the latest character to beat everything. at the end of the day they will still make the newest characters best suited for the most recently released content but it doesnt mean you need them. you'll eventually pull a character with a global passive down the line if you keep playing. cant believe some people are using the global passive as a reason to be mad at the free anniversary jades and tickets. ""you cant fool us into not complaining anout the global passives"" they say when they give us this reward every anniversary 🎉🎉🎉"
"at this point, people are already forgot acheron game breaking ability."
"If one considers leaving the game because of the developers decision to make changes in THEIR game, do yourself a favour and leave, this is not the attitute you have when enjoying a video game"
The problem isn’t this one single global passive. The problem is it’s a precedent for Hoyo and others that could ruin many games in the long run.
"Guys, im from the future. Cipher gives you 10 stellar jades per day as global, Phainon generates 30 extra stamina per day. Cyrene will give you a 20% Crit dmg buff as global passive. Saber will give you 20% Atk as global passive. Archer will give you 35% HP as global passive."
"The problem with this exchange shop shit is they’re just gonna add units that are long obsolete into the shop. We are ‘given’ Luocha, who has been dead since FX/Aventurine, or Ruanmei, whose niches have all been powercrept besides weakness break efficiency. Both are also early 1.X characters. By the time someone useful like Robin or Sunday hits the shop, they’re going to release an Emanator of Harmony that advance forwards the entire team 3 times with 50% RES PEN 😂😂"
I'm about to get castorice since I lost on tribbie and I'm out 😂
"> Global Passive means more Global passives in the future evenif kit game breaking, they  MIGHT apply gamebreaking ones, especially it's Hoyo

> Testing new mechanics means they'll over do it in the future and a lot more enhanced and a lot stronger with a catch
Ex: powerful E2 and E1, signature lightcones only good for it's respective unit 

> More powerful Gamebreaking units means Harder enemies and HP inflation whuch means older units sucks ahh 

> Older units sucks ahh means forcing you to pull newer unit even if you like them or not 

In conclusion: Hoyo games aren't for casuals and F2P in the future (even rn ngl) unless you got lucky, which means, be a gambler and spend more money! :>"
"Just like mr pokke said 
""We are basically taking out the trash"" 😂 to players complaining about powercreep"
"People keep afraid of Global Passive will not be a one time thing and will spread more in the future but... Just look at Kafka, she still the only DoT enabler in the entire game.

Yes that not a really fair comparison but the point I want to make is character uniqueness can be preserve. Instead of looking Castorice's Global as a new system, why don't we just think of it as her own originality."
WHO IS WE?
Reminder that you shouldn't base your opinions on how cc's or random internet users think. Play the game or don't
"""Nikkie is not a gooner game"" ...how? Cause u cant straight up f**k the characters? Oh wait....u can...canonically...multiple times. 

How's fob spitting hot ass like this but then saying ""i like varesa""? Pick a side bro...are u based or not lol."
I don't think if it's a good idea to say to buff olders characters while putting some on perma. Why would you make efforts to make them even viable when they probably won't give you a penny anymore...
Seethe for they are taking it from you
Nothing is ending
"literally been saying this, it's not even new for them there older games been had them just people don't play there games"
"I don't play HI3rd, could you name me some examples of global passives on this game, just to get a glimpse of how effective they are  ?"
10 atk per divine key is not the same???? Do you even play hi3??? And many of the trash powercrept keys are rather easy to get from free rewards. You can grind for better buffs like 9% fire dmg but this doesnt even come close to a unique effect rather than slightly more damage
"Many of the passives are flat hp or flat defense, which is utterly useless. 10 flat attack per key is a drop in the bucket. As for the slightly stonger 8% elemental damage buffs, they will maybe give you a 2-3 second faster clear if you even bother turning them on, which I usually dont. Just like the castorice buff, if you have proper teams with proper builds it wont matter if you have it or not, and if you have shit teams with shit builds the globals wont make enough of a difference to matter."
" @Karnage432  1st, HI3 has rankings, and they have brackets. If you are casual, maybe in 3rd brackets, the passive won't matter much. Basically, the passives are stat boost like fire ATK boost, SP boost, etc."
 @Karnage432  the difference in performance between the guy who has all global passives and who dont - less than 5%
the difference is you don't have to pull a character to get the global passive in hi3. and also people just accepted that their valks in hi3 will one day get powercrept so none of that matters to them
"@ ??? You do have to gacha them, esp when they 1st came out. You could say the same with HSR, maybe in the future Castorice will be added in the list of 50/50 pool, and then you don't have to ""pull""."
"You have no fucking idea what you’re talking about 😂 what laws, what WuWa adaptation, what „letting the game die“. We are the vast minority of the game‘s playerbase, if all of us quit today nothing changes for them. You just gotta realise this stuff isn’t directed at you, so maybe instead of trying to ruin the fun for everybody else you might wanna look into your own issues and just quit the game."
The idea of global passives has been done in gacha for 15 plus years
@CordneyRobinson  So this makes anything what I said different?
" @mtmartian7252  yea the idea that a global buff will kill a game is crazy when there are games with these buffs going strong.
2 it's also disingenuous to think that the global buffs will effect gameplay massively and that the game will be designed around them when they haven't designed the game around having e6s5 characters and thinking omg this will effect wuwa is also just crazy talk when like I said global buffs been a thing in these type of games for 15 plus years"
 @CordneyRobinson  I never said the game will die I said the community needs to let the game die so it doesn't come to other games. Which it is wishful thinking to not think it will if proven to be financially successful. WuWa I think will try to tweak it a bit to make the community happier potentially but I don't see how this remotely will help the community. You are throwing a lot of accusations around when you are saying nothing to actually give proof this won't happen especially since hoyo has already proven time and time again where their bottomline is. If you really are just so defensive about this just quit you will be happier since you won't have to defend anything.
"@mtmartian7252  the proof is that hoyo isn't the first to do this there are a number of games that predate hoyos existence that do this so saying that wuwa is waiting to see if it's financially good doesn't makes sense in fact the reason they are doing it because data shows that it is financially good based on data from other games in the genre over the years I'm not making any accusations per say I'm just merely pointing out that 
1. Global buffs not new to gacha space 
2.its bringing implemented based on data from other games that have done it in the space of course they will put there twist on it but concept as a whole isn't new
3.hoyo doing this won't change others games because again this isn't a new concept it's been done in other games 
4. If you play any of the PVP based gachas you will realize how insignificant it is in the grand scheme of things I've played with players that were spending 1k a week had a friend spend 50k in a sitting so my point is these global buffs will never hit predatory level at least to the standard of predatory that these eastern cultures spend on game. So if you play any gacha and the company is based in East this kind of practice will be the rule not the exception"
" @CordneyRobinson  you are trying so hard to defend the global buffs and hoyo. Who cares if other games have done it before the vast majority of them don't do it for a reason. Any that have them I will refuse to play so have fun whaling I guess. Can't wait for hsr to get pvp so it becomes even more whaling intensive. 
Trying to say it is financially lucrative when hoyo never needed to do this before and now they decide to do this I find an odd argument. They are choosing to try and squeeze the life out of the players continuing to play the game because the game is on a downward trend it isn't going to be good for them long term it benefits no one. 
I really don't care if the East has a spending problem and they eat up this predatory nonsense doesn't mean everyone outside the east just has to like it. 
Kuro has shown to try and take some thing and implement them better I don't believe it is a genshin knockoff like people like to say but I think if they somehow frame it in a way that a stupid person thinks it is smart they will go for it. If WuWa was released first it would be in the exact situation hoyo is in honestly."
@mtmartian7252  the vast majority do lmao u just haven't been around long hoyo was one of the first gacha to have a pity system and a 50/50 system they have improved the space in that aspect before you could spend 1000 and get no 5 star characters . I'm not mindlessly defending them I'm just using critical thinking and global buffs operate on the same premise as edilons. Moc isn't designed around e6s5 characters so why should moc all of a sudden be based around global buffs. 90 percent of this is just fomo. You mentioned they are trying to squeeze the life out of the players how it's not like you have to pull I haven't pulled in months and still clear everything and I have a f2p with only standard 5 star and I still clear so even the idea that this global buffs is gonna break the game or make you spend is insane you as a avg player are not meant to have every new character and the game is designed in that way if you want every character then you aren't a avg player you are a spender because it's ridiculous to think you will get every 5 star for free and as a f2p it ridiculous to try and build a lot of different characters and teams you should be picking you two DPS and vertically build as a f2p alot of the problem in this game come from RSS mismanagement and poor pull choices I personally haven't spent since Fei first dropped and I still 0 cycle both sides with Acheron and Fei but these are my only two teams and DPS and I've vertical in vested in them
@mtmartian7252  I do agree if the gameplay suffers from it then it will be a problem but they haven't done anything to suggest that because the game is still designed to be beat by e0 variants of units and the end game isn't built for the e6 variants even tho the buffs are there and available to everyone. There track record shows they will still make everything clearable for a E0 player because the game has to be beatable no matter when someone starts playing so they can't even design the game around buffs like that because the barrier of entry alot of the fear comes from fomo cuz no one wants to miss out or feel like others have advantages over another that's why e6 players get killed for being unrelatable rather than being like oh snap u got the e6 cool lol
@ that is great you can clear it f2p but leaks are suggesting the fate collabs will also have global passives and they will probably have another before 4.0. Also what happens in 4.0 will they have two global passives. What if they design an enemy that kills you outright to make the Castorice passive mandatory in MOC. This is not a f2p thing at all and they also are having a spending event to promote spending. They are clearly telling you who this is for. Not everyone is lucky in this game so they won't be able to get everything it just sets a bad precedent. What happens in 4.0 when your vertical invested dps units are useless because power creep is increasing at a fast rate. I also still don't understand why you think just because a different game does it that all of a sudden makes me wrong. A few games can be wrong at once. i have played a lot of gachas as well and none of them have had it. If you played the more predatory ones hey congrats on promoting their practice more and more to give star rail ideas.
@mtmartian7252  so we are more or less on same page it really just comes down to how they handle it I've played games it's been really good and games it's been horrible as long as moc and the other end game modes don't require the global passives but just make it easier then it really won't effect anything but like you said if they make enemies directly make u need a global passive to complete it will be predatory so it really depends how it goes going forward if it's tame like 4 percent here 2 percent there things like that it won't be game breaking we will have to wait and see how it is handled and how they handle old units buffs we can make a judgement after a few moc and see if her passive changed anything
 @CordneyRobinson  if you see it that way it is fine but to me the game has fell off after act 2 of penaconny so I was already losing interest. To me what the game does now regardless doesn't matter with the implementation of global passives. Just sucks how much I enjoyed the game a year ago and just hasn't really grabbed me since. I honestly find genshin a better game right now in like every way funnily enough. I might come back in a year to check it out like I do with feh and afk journey but honestly this game pissed me off more than both of those games did so might be longer or not at all.
@mtmartian7252  I absolutely agree I did not enjoy penacony and amp is lackluster I don't feel the need to play story like I used to the lack of voice acting and cutscenes is ridiculous and all the quest feel dry I think they need to come up with some more game modes and introduce a new cast of 4stars I've already stopped spending just waiting to see how stuff shake out with old units buffs cuz I wanna use jingliu and blade more often
"That’s because Fob is slightly, and it is kinda slight, wrong with his China narrative. 

It’s true that the passive isn’t inherently a big deal on CN, though some do have an issue with the global passive, powercreep has become something of an issue there. 

They don’t like how hard endgame is getting at its current rate, and how quickly units are becoming worthless. 

Yes they have a much higher tolerance for p2w and powercreep than over here, but it’s still just a tolerance. There’s still a limit, and hoyo is kinda starting to push it. 

How much more they can push it remains to be seen, but given the other issues Hsr currently has I imagine it’s not much more (there have been many story complaints too, which is probably why there’s the 3.8 update)."
"Chinese fanbase is quite easily appeased or controlled compared to global audiences. They are used to that living standards, so hoyo is slowly making them accepting ""must pull"" units for HSR. They know Chinese fanbase will bow down in time if they drip this kind of characters slowly."
Exactly 😂
"The issue isn’t competition. It simplifies down to two big problems. 

One, it makes people to pull for characters outside of their actual appeal as a gacha character. Yeah meta pulling in gacha is a losing game, but it doesn’t make it any less scummy. 

Two, endgame will be balanced around global passives. As they slowly stack up, it’ll screw over everyone who likes characters who aren’t shilled with passives."
People seems struggle against AI
​ @justapotbro547  that's intellectually dishonest to say it will be based around global passives when the game isn't based around edilon buffs which is essentially the same thing
" @CordneyRobinson 
It’s also dishonest to compare a feature included in the base kit of a character that applies to all modes even when they’re not on the team. 

At the very least eidolons are only active when you use the character."
@justapotbro547  that's a cop out and u know it Acheron kills over world herta finds chest units have global buffs already in a sense a revive changes literally nothing this is just doom posting and fomo
​ @CordneyRobinson if castorice passive worked everywhere beside the end game content no one would complain the character you named make overworld experience better they could also made castorice that having her make you don't randomly die fighting mobs but she works everywhere as long as you have her on your account and you may argue it's not that big it doesn't help but let's say it's true than that more reason to make it not work in end game content since it doesn't do anything anyways
⁠ @CordneyRobinson  wtf? Overworld kills just save time and chest finding just saves you from using yt. That’s not comparable to a permanent endgame content buff at all.
" @justapotbro547   did you think Castorice global buff will save you from endgame content? NO, if you die, you still losing stars."
@justapotbro547  and all revive saves u is a restart so u see how ridiculous it is to be worried about such min buff
"Spending 1-2 extra cycles is having to deal with something that didn't exist before. The only reason to add them in is for more fomo, and it in no way is an overall positive for the player. Why should anyone be cool with something that randomly negatively affects them for no gain? They are just laying the ground work for shit that's going to erode whatever semblance of game balance was left. It's lame man, makes the game less fun."
"are these ""Dreams"" or are you just trolling? lmao"
I hate how I can imagine this happening in the future. Maybe not the 10 stellar jades (unless Hoyo is a goblin) but it is possible. It's even more of a f you in the face if they only make it exclusively to limited characters. At least give it to every single character.
​ @SchifferThe2nd you're the kind of person who would be fooled by a tunnel painted onto a wall
Definitely not the 10 stellar jades lmao!
​ @CultureAdd1ct he is joking
 @CultureAdd1ct  hes just trolling but its pretty close imo
" @Húhú202ehhe  The jades and the stamina are the only ones where im like ""........alright, lets simmer down"" lmao. But i did hear the collab units had global passives and the other ones seem realistic."
"@ just exaggeration, but if you spend 160 pulls for cipher it would take 7 years to earn them back from 10 per day. I just made them up, nothing in particular. Would hate it if they actually go this direction"
what about the moc hp inflation did they listen.
​@zap7737 pretty sure all of the other global passives people had dreams about were proved to not be legitimate dreams
​@ bro is a history fictionologist
"Damn...by looking all these responds, they literally highschooler who take anything serious"
3650 stellar jades in a year enough for 20 pulls 😂
@ 18 blues two purples
" @CultureAdd1ct  As of this morning, there is no indication that there is any other passive SO FAR"
"​ @thescorbunny9511  100% will be more. Once you go down this road, and players accepted it, theres zero reason for them to stop doing it for more profits. Capitalism demands it."
Luocha is coming back thanks to Castorice. Ruan mei is still a very good generalist support
​@Salientspeaker56  thanks to mydei i was able to use him again
Yes but you can still use those old characters to clear so its a net positive to get them without going out of your way. You can focus on pulling new characters instead of always getting stressed over the reruns.
this comment are clearly people who are fomo ruan mei can be viable with castorice team luocha is good for mydei
They didnt increase HP to keep up with powercreep; they increased it to FORCE everyone to get eidolons/signature LC or pull new meta character to keep up. Powercreep has existed before and it doesnt hit us as hard it is until recently. Firefly & acheron casually clears within 1-2 cycles and suddenly it took them 4-5 cycles to clear
"Actually, I am curious about the game for f2p that means. What is the borderline of the f2p game?"
​ @kimoboom1126  okay im return player and f2p for hsr.for this issue is just dont  buff monster.then it is all good and for me f2p game you can look at limbus company.
"yeah, theyre all dumb as bricks lol."
Same goes for the opposite. Don't act like the game is above criticizing and don't attack CCs or random internet users because of their opinion. Discuss things like a normal human being or get off social media.
@Inco_Grapha exactly either or you should base your own off of yourself whether positively or negatively
Preach
fob's opinion most of the time comes from someone who is to far gone to be argued with. he is straight up stupid
When you are in a mindless consoomer competition but your opponent is Fob
"Castorices, global passive is a whatever, it doesn't change much. However my worry is when global passives start stacking which could be very dangerous. I really hope they limit to just 1 per team or exclude it entirely from endgame. I think that would fix some issues. I have my doubts but one can hope."
global passive doesnt matter because hsr has been powercreeping since last year and all your yapping changed nothing.  so why complain more? did yall not play genshin?
people that think that they are special or important spamming that they are quitting is really annoying im going to start to call it american make honkai star rail great again. serious yeah global passive can be a problem but i dont care lmao they are giving more free stuff + fixing story and etc. btw i want more content too and the new game mode but i can wait lol. im playing like 50 other games.
People are trying to be soy rebels for some revolution in gacha game
"Does people can't see what's happening after they quit Genshin and all those melanin drama? Genshin still thrive and do what they always did like nothing happened lmao. They don't care about F2Ps and some whales opinion as long as the majority of the eastern players and their giga whale fanboy happy. Those giga whales fund hoyo like at least 90% of their revenue. What does the other 10% source of income do for them if they quit? Nothing! But hey, I'm not against the rebel or people stating their opinion, it's just I find it funny when people dramatize their decision to quit like it's some kind of political vote that your well being depends on it. Just quit bro. HoYo will change only if their giga whale fanboy finally converts to Kuro giga whale fanboy."
We killing (or potentially making its life shorter) the game with this one
"Way too sanitised to shit at this point cuz of having bad gacha before ToT. Whatever it is, I keep knowledge of what's happening but I'm already used to this stuff so I'm just gonna chill and play like usual enjoy stuff when it's cool and that's it lol"
"Global passive aside, which is dog shit, this might be the worst anniversary livestream ive ever seen."
"This kind of gives a ""always save up for anniversary patch"" morale of story vibe 😅"
"There's nothing we can do for the game nor the industry, just quit the whole genre for your own good or accept the new tier of monetization. But remember folks, games used to be designed in the interest of the player, being fun for being games, now they're just made to incentivize you to spend for every little thing. That might feel good in its own right but ultimately you're only serving their purpose, they're not serving yours nor even having a fair exchange, you're just being milked unapologetically as hard as possible"
"Eh, as long as passives aren't account wide stat buffs i dont care.  Extra credits/materials/SU/DU buffs?  Its fine"
The dream ive had about hsr is memo sprite jingyuan and fire kafka
"Was soo hard to keep up with powercreep and global buff hit the final nail for me , Left hsr when i heared leakers talking  about global buff  sh*t .
And now i am living stress free life , best decision of my life."
"it's not because of the global passives, but i'm realizing that this game isnt for me. the game is way too casual with an apparent casual community who is better off without exhibitionists like myself. i have quit because the game is too easy with nothing to do; luckily, i started marvel rivals and already climbed to plat in a week of starting. i forget how fun online pvp games were"
This entire debate made the people complaining pretty much cannon in the lore as the Mourning Actors and Hoyo as the IPC without the military power 😅😅😭😭
Gigazad at it again
Are people really complaining that they got spoiled on a story they haven’t gone through in almost 6 weeks especially when they do story recap in every livestream so it’s nothing new?
At this point jenazad should’ve just uploaded this since he was the actual one who was leading the conversation
"Imagine future character having a 10% RES PEN or 10% ATK/HP global passive haha, of course that would never happend"
the passive works even if the character is not in the party.... its also doesn't matter if you use a different team
"@HarzinLolz  I think you need to reread what I said.  I know how it works. What I meant is it could be dangerous when the passives start stacking and limiting active global passives, so they don't start stacking on top of each other"
" @definitelynotahedgehog9461  You see, your fatal flaw was thinking that the guy replying has a skill called, ""reading comprehension"" when in reality it's an ultra rare SSS tier skill that only the advanced humans have.

Also yeah. Honestly I'd be fine with global passives if they
1) give one to every limited 5 star and
2) make it so you can only have 1 enabled at a time.

But since it's literally just castorice, it's just a display of favoritism on a level hoyo has never gone to before."
" @definitelynotahedgehog9461  i Agree the passive effect is meh at best and they could literally put global passives tied to content progression, like for example: +10% HP by completing space station, +10% Def by completing Belobog, 10% atk by completing ambrosial arbor, 10% crit rate by defeating phantylia, etc...
Instead they made it in the worst possible way with the shittiest effect possible"
"​@djohnthesalty  for now, we can safely say that global passives would only be given to anniversary char which is castorice. Let's be honest here, hoyo lives waifus than husbandos so only the female will get very special treatment so if we only gt one global passive every year. It changes nothing here"
" @djohnthesalty  for now the passive is fine (still bad that it exists) , we just have to wait what hoyo will do when the second global passive drops. If any of those become stat buffs, that would be really bad."
"They have displayed high levels of favouritism before Castorice, but now they are just breaking the game's logic. 

I truly think people should stop thinking ""The skill is fine, the problem is the future"", because the whole point of the god daam game is that at the very least the characters has to be an active member to activate its ability.

Acheron herself came with a fucking ""Skip Battle"" button, that to this day works perfectly fine, I don't like that they did that to this day, but at least they gave it a limitation that she has to be in the team, and it doesn't function on Elites. Castorice has a total of 0 limitions, the only thing stopping it being that you need Heals or Shields, wich is something all endgame teams will have outside of 0-cycles. Its fucking abysmal"
How would that even work? They would need to implement a new UI to toggle which global passive. They haven't even gotten to artifact load outs.
"​ @Salientspeaker56  watch them implement it to Phainon, Cyrene and the fate collab characters"
@Male_Ficent  phainon is a no. You know hoyo loves to gives these to waifus. Cyrene is a stretch. Fate chars is a possibility but unknown for now
MoC already doesnt count 3 stars when Castorice passive activates because the game thinks someone died. So it doesnt give you 3 star
Yeah one or 2 arznt really a problem of them but if all the upcoming important amphorieus characters have one it might become quite a differance compared to an account that doenst have all of those characters
"Imagine they'll just release crit rate, atk, crit dmg increase global passive on phainon when he arrives 💀"
"Those things you're asking for weren't present in the beta for Castorice. So I wouldn't hold hope for Hoyo to ""do the right thing""."
"Phainon probably will have 20% crit rate global buff, and there will be another one later since hoyo gonna make 3 characters with global buff for each new region after this."
"Think deeper kids,
If whales with 20+ global passives on patch 4.X+ start clearing content too easily, they will get bored and stop pulling for more globals (reverting back to f2p mindset of non meta-chasing and just pulling chars they like)

Hoyoverse is a company that has gone public, to please each and everyone demand, revenue should not have an inbound drop / decrease. They need to keep selling

Now if the game cannot readjust down old chars and their skills, they will likely just toughen up and make stages in moc etc harder, now the f2p and light spenders will be d one having a hardtime to 3star their usual moc pf as and they will face a decrease in free jades acquired 🎉🎉🎉"
"So called ""powercreeping"" has slowed down a lot. New chars are not stronger than Yunli in 2.4 or Rappa in 2.6. Castorice is not stronger than The Herta as well"
the fuck are you yapping about
not the masculine spender.
So you're the chad shills then? lmao
I think the Genshin 3 year so 3 wishes of appreciation is far worse that came with the 4.4 Special Program.
" @TOTGodofWar  I said that IVE ever seen. I dont play Genshin, so i dont watch their livestreams."
​​ @TOTGodofWar that wasn't anniversary(y'all also just misconstrued what they said but whatever)
​ @CultureAdd1ct the scenario they're mentioning wasn't even during anniversary is the funniest thing.
 @justsomeguy727  Yeah you are correct. That Genshin situation happened during the 4.4 special program.
You don't need to and if you feel that way take a step back and think about what type of game it is (single player gacha).
castorice's global passive is account wide
" @HarzinLolz  it is and its also almost entirely useless. 

What they're talking about is a global passive that provides 50% damage boost or something and works in all content."
true if they release like a global passive that gives like 5% credits on assignments or Simulated Universe i will be like so this is the global passive that u guys complain about?
@ ok so what happens if more characters with global passives are introduced. they will probably stack with each other. that is the problem not that one is ok its that multiple are not
​ @HarzinLolz  it's literally useless
@ ok by itself sure but i am not talk about if a global passive appears once i am saying if more  then one character gets them.
 @HarzinLolz  we don't know anything about that yet so let's not look too much into the future
@ ight when it happens don't be mad or saying you didn't see it coming
 @HarzinLolz  i am genuinely playing HSR for the story and lore endgame is not my top priority. Like even I can't clear MoC 12 it's fine it is just 80 Jades. So it won't bother me as much🤷.
​ @Ayush-kc2vx you say it's useless let's say it is than why have it in the first place they could have made it so only worked when castorice is in the team or only works outside of pf/moc/apo it's useless anyways right and I guarantee no one would have complained if that was the case there is a reason they not doing that and they decided to make it global
 @mlg9814  well i agree with that all of this could have been avoided if it just worked in over world and SU
Yay
u said u quit and yet u still look for hsr leaks ????
" @jawbonedis  lmao what ? Maybe you need to read entire comment slowly bro 
Guess you are too fast to read  and skipped something and jumped on me for thing that didn't happen 🤣🤣🤣"
Bro was stressing out with a anime gacha game bruh.
" @skitteronline   ""Left hsr when heared i heared leakers talking about global buff sh*t"" this is what u said bro tell me where am i wrong? no matter what u heard or seen u still look at leaks"
" @jawbonedis  lmao 🤣🤣 are you serious? 
I typed  ""I left"" and not ""I am leaving"" 
Why would someone look for leaks one they done with something? Guess you wana be a nice hoyoshill and defend daddy HSR xD 
Good luck with that 👍 or maybe you just want a target to get your inner anger thrown at 🤣🤣 well whatever it is you need to calm down and learn to read before making any claims rushing is not good you know XD it makes you look fool"
" @mirei9225  yeah bro it was stressy situation it was my 1st turn based game and loved this concept but was hard to clear stuff with e0s0.  overtime it felt like it's 9/5 job  to get all possible currency I felt like need to replace experienced guy with newcomers/ freshers so that way a business owner can earn big with less spending XD 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
(This was example for pulling new unit every patch to clear all content without worrying about any strategy/ planning) 
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
"​ @skitteronline bruh you play genshin, wuwa and zzz too. It is not stress free life at all lmao."
@ yeah i can agree with you on this matter xD but hey now days i just log in for 5 min do the dailies and off to play escape from tarkov oh i absolutely in love with escape from tarkov i just started playing gacha games like year ago  i still love some of them but i found EFt now xD escape from takov just wont let me play other games for long
Nice. -1 for snowflakes
"So good luck, skill issue man. So hard powercreep where Serval hypercarry pack can pass Nikador in like 3 cycles with only one 5 star char in the team"
"Fr… the story loss my interest after the end of Penacony so the only enjoyment comes from end-game resets. Tbh, 10 mins of content every 2 weeks is not worth it to me.

I just started Marvel Rivals too. Coming from someone who grew up on CoD, Halo, and LoL, I don’t know how I ended up ever liking a gacha game. It’s so refreshing again to play a game where Meta and strategy actually matters."
wuwa is the best place for us
"It is a casual games bro😭, i mean it's not wrong if you quit cause you don't like PvE and going to PvP"
" @AFK_idle  i wouldnt mind it if there was more end game content that was challenging and difficult

resets are every 2 weeks for 10 mins of playtime. i could care less about the disney events, story, etc so that’s why i quit… not bc of pve"
When I feel like playing something simple just hop on hsr when I want some adrenaline I play phasmo and Cod with friends lol it's not that deep just play depending on your mood
"This game is a cake walk even for F2P but I think it’s a waste of time even logging in to use stamina when there is nothing to do - a mundane chore. I wanted to log in only for MoC, AS, and PF resets but I don’t find it rewarding to upkeep my account everyday just to clear"
"Y'all said this game is ez, but i wonder why so many people say MoC is hard🤔(im not one of them tho)"
"@ Probably because the community is very casual (i’m not a sweat but i’m not unaware of what i do).

Also, people that think it is easy may not need to say anything compared to the complainer who can’t clear. This community is very unreceptive to help too… they rather just complain"
" @squish-da-peepo  im also a casual, i don't pull for OP male like Sunday or Aventurine, and i still clear end game by pulling Eidolons or LC. There are just so much way to clear endgames. But yeah human never statisfied and they always complain"
And then you get the Enigmata and Elation stirring the pot further.
 @Grayewicked  History Fictionologists spreading misinformation while Masked Fools laughing at everybody. AM LITERLALLY A MASKED FOOL LMAOOo
The true NEUTRAL man
"I think it’s fair to not want spoilers in the stream. A lot of people join the livestreams in order to see the new characters and content even when they haven’t finished the story. I for example, started the game a few months ago and am nearing the end of Penacony, but still want to see the anniversary events without spoilers."
"@ Twitter, reddit or the hoyo site is gonna be the best options for spoiler free news"
 @Zagreus248  Then you can simply look on the website where it has all the info.
"He doesn't upload much unfortunately, he streams a lot tho and has a decent number of concurrents"
you never know hoyo can probably pull it off
"you know theres a huge gap between 10% atk/hp and 10% res pen, right?"
10% ATK/HP lets be honest it fucking useless if they really wanna powercreep global passives they should at least make it 50%
"Well there's no information from dataminers or leakers to even suggest that and that would probably upset a lot of the community in japan and china, yes china is mroe accepting of thsoe things from what I understand its a mixed bag there as well with most being indifferent to the passive for now because its not a big deal.
However the next anniversary unit might have one and the question becomes what type of passive is it and what does it do etc."
"​ @emanuel5242  im just providing an example for what the future could hold. 
X% Follow up damage increase, X% increase in Additional DMG, X% DMG Reduction, X% Energy Regen increase, etc. 

They are small buffs but they add up overtime. This is the problem."
" @ayayato_  thats true but i think its will never all at once. theres will be limit to active ones, unless as u said in future this might broke the game"
 @dev1lykt14   i have a feeling that global passives will stack as characters are released which can be bad depend on how strong and how many characters get global passives
"@ certainly its a bad thing, and i hope that devs will limit number of active ones, so u can atleast have somewhat balance. because if they will do endgame difficility based on passives that exist it would ruin balance so badly."
@ oh i forgot the character might not even need to be in a party to trigger the global passive you just have to own them
" @jawbonedis  no, thats dumb. The whole point of the global passives is that theres tons of them. So you dont shove 50% on one unit. You have 10% spread across 5."
This wont happen
" @dev1lykt14  yeah, ruined balance where 2 cost Qingque or Seele passes Nikador in 0 cycles. Very broken balance"
 @skcmoonlord  youre trolling if you think it wont happen lol
Nobody cares whether you quit the game or not because of a single update sadly 😂
Hoyoshill opinion on a hoyo game while getting sponsored by hoyo is crazy
ciphers +5% credits global passive will break the game guys
"Brother it’s a single player game! Absolutely nobody cares if you can clear MOC, it’s all in your head, just pull on the character you like and play the game you wanna play, it’s piss easy anyway. MOC is a timesink and borderline unnecessary to enjoy the game.
Now go have fun. As there is no fucking META in a single player game!!!"
"If a day comes where the global passives are a must to clear endgame content will be the day I will quit the game. For now though let's see where this ride takes us, still pulling Castorice cause big dragon makes simple man happy"
hmmm
Gachasmack crying in the corner
fob is so tone deaf its behind wild
"The unfortunate part is if all EN decides to drop the game, hoyo would literally not care. We only make up like 10% of the actual player base for hsr. And while there is some complaints over in the cn and jp side, they aren't as prevalent for the company to make changes. That's the harsh reality of the situation some people can't seem to accept. Games not gonna die or change anytime soon, its gonna stay being garbage for years to come, and it really sucks to see."
"Topaz global passive, Acheron global passive, oh wow another global passive in a single player game.  Must be the end of the world!  F all the haters!"
"I quite like the global passive as I find it convenient to get a skill/untility once by pulling one character and share it with every character instead of pulling one character for each team to have the synergy. Also save me the trouble of leveling up characters. It is not as if Castorice’s global passive enables immortality of characters during battle, they still can die, even Mydei is not immortal.
Anyway, I pull for characters that I like, regardless of meta."
">Complain about the global passive breaking the game
>Realize that the global passive will not break the game
>Complain that other future characters receiving a global passive might break the game
>Realize that other future characters are not getting global passive
>Literally workshopping complaining that other games might introduce global passives that might break their game
>Idea gets shut down immediately

Guys, comon, what should we complain about next?"
If they do add other global passives at least make them as minimal a as possible like a global 10% dmg buff
"I think you can see global passive as something to make your game easier to play in the future, and for future, i mean like even 4.0 or 5.0, they won't keep giving global passive to every new character, and this isn't even the first global passive character, Acheron's instant kill is also one, like for now some player already don't main her, but still use her for exploring and in simulated Universe.
If they give us global passive character periodically , like every anniversary, I think it's ok.
Also, the good way of global passive is even if the character got powercreep, you can still play easier even you don't got the strongest character in the future, that's actually good for f2p.
The only two thing we need to worry about are keep giving global passive character every new update and you must need global passive character to win a game, but i believe these two won't happen, Mihoyo is greedy, but not stupid, ofc they know if they do that, players will be leaving."
The crybabies are already crying on Reddit lmfao 😂
"Y'all didn't talk about anything. It was mainly a yap session with absolutely no point, and when the serious things were ""addressed"", I put it in quotations because it wasn't even addressed properly just the ""yeah it sucks anyways it is what it is"", it was poor Jenazad vs 5 hoyo shills and Braccs was just tryna be neutral. Tectone and GachaSmack should've also been there to atleast balance out the sides. 

Also fob's undermining of the whole core problem by saying ""global passive is whatever, this is normal in Asia and they will like it"" / ""who cares about global, they barely make up any percentage of the playerbase/revenue"" is just so pathetic. While it's true because asia gacha culture is beyond cooked, and they're so far gone accepting horrendous gacha practices, the western community is still REALLY big. This guy usually has good takes but when it comes to standing on business or on actual SERIOUS discussions like these, his hoyo shilling shows its full colors and he goes full hoyobot (even though he calls out hoyo games on a daily basis on his streams)."
"At this point there’s only 2 things you do:
- suck it up and accept that global passives will unfortunately be a thing
- quit the game since there’s no point in complaining because they don’t listen"
"yeah west people always complains about everything, i mean it's not even REAL PVP GAME, it is a problem if the game are PVP game, but it is not we literally  play against programmed enemy A BOT."
I promise nobody cares.
For people thinking that this isn’t that big of a deal and the passive isn’t even that strong you have to remember that this isn’t just about the passive itself and how good it is its also about the precedent this sets that hoyo can just lock huge shit like this behind the gacha and because hoyo is currently the biggest gacha company other smaller games will follow suit which will result in the gacha space a pretty predatory space already becoming more predatory
Them quitting is literally PEAK comedy 😂
and also announcing it as if like people would care if you quit like bro 😂

"​@vexusdesu6272  it's true that people who say I'll quit 100 times should quit, but your sentences about it ain't being that deep is like genshin players mindset, so we shouldn't expect qol or any changes because it's just a game right?"
You cared
You say that and yet you still have an hoyo character as profile 🫥
 @Ayush-kc2vx they didn’t say they dnt like hoyo tho also u dnt gotta like hoyo to enjoy kafka
Is that the one makes gachasmack quit HSR?
" @AaAldi-vr3fe  Nah, he already quit. He quit because you can see how Hoyo is going to add even more pay to win elements over and over again instead of fixing issues, so he dipped. He didn't have fun with the game anymore and called quits. Personally something I believe gacha players can't do no matter how miserable they are"
" @destinystriumph1573   with that kinda mindset, I bet he's gonna quit wuwa as well if dev trying to make some money with boosting their products, even he already rant over cantarella's faster swimming gimmick in the game"

OldgeSmack hasn't played HSR seriously for over half a year, he was just looking for a loud reason to leave and catch the hype xd"

"​@ViktorAl-o9z  Wuwa is constantly improving, taking player's feedback and implementing it. By saying it's perfect, you're essentially stating that it should make no further improvements. Loving a game is good, but worshipping it is not. It will only stagnate the game's growth. 

Wuwa is appreciated on the basis that it LISTENS to its playerbase. Why are you calling it perfect? Because a perfect game simply does not exist. As a perfect game  would imply it needs no improvements."
@ as you should
"@ 
But doesn't the developers' lining up for any request from players elevate the game's status to perfect? ​​I think that's true. 
I hope that my request to add an even more naked character with an even larger chest size will also be satisfied, because the developers really listen to the players. 
And it would also be great if they removed the limit on flights.
I also asked them to add the ability to collect chests in AoE so I don't have to look for them, it's too boring.
On the other hand, they could remove chests from the game altogether, it's a relic of the past from Genshin, and send all the currency and resources to the mail at the beginning of the patch. 
This would make the game not just perfect but ideal"
" @ViktorAl-o9z  What? I... I think our thoughts are running at different wavelengths... Uh... good day to you! 
😭😭😭"
@ LMAOOOO The sarcasm went over your head. Kinda pointless to makes arguements with fanatical zealots who think the game is perfect as it is.
"Yeah, especially for F2P players with 50+ million credits like me"
" @siri6745  
I mean, isn't that why everyone loves Wuwa so much? 
Because the developers respect the players, slather them with freebies and handouts, simplify the movement around the world so it's easier to get currency for pulls, twist every storyline around a female character who in the end becomes the player's new wife? 
I just think they can go even further :)"
" @idontspeakjapanese6289  I knew he was being sarcastic... That's why I was shocked. He thought that's what I meant when I was said that Wuwa's devs listens to their playerbase... 
 You're right though... I just don't get the point of worshipping a game no matter how good it is... 😮‍💨 😭"
 @idontspeakjapanese6289  bro ICANT
"@ Just like Genshin and HSR, Wuwa also a dedicted fanatical group of white knights and zealots defending the game for criticisms. 

I won't argue that it's the best gacha game, it deserves to be it, because you can see the devs passion about the game, but calling it perfect is literally something else and his reply on your comment.........bro is on his high horse"
" @idontspeakjapanese6289  Yeah! I also agree Wuwa is really really good game. I was completely addicted the first one month I played it, and still play consistently every day... But to say it's perfect and needs no improvements is a really dangerous thought. 
😔"
 @idontspeakjapanese6289  Wuwa fans seem to be too young to engage in an internet conversations
"​ @idontspeakjapanese6289  wuwatards are like genshintards 2.0
They're like a cult. The game has so many faults and this kid is dickriding. Echo farming and upgrading problem, still boring story, the most horrible gender ratio."
"I also like how wuwa listen to their player but one thing i hated in this game which is real money currency is more expensive. If you player from europe its ok, immagine other people form asia which thier money currency is low than europe currency. You need to pay more for it​@ViktorAl-o9z"
 @ViktorAl-o9z  cut to everybody in the official server still having problems with the optimizations of the game.
"@ oh yeah, i have them too 
Wuwa almost burned my pc :)"
 @ViktorAl-o9z  so not a perfect game then
" @thatsaber01  nope, still perfect, devs listened, hail solon"
"@ Perfect is a stretch, it's a good game but there's glaring flaws. The devs do listen more but the key difference between the companies is that you can tell Wuwa devs actually care about their games imo"
" @destinystriumph1573  yes, they care about audience without which the game will die, unlike hoyo, who think only about the money that players bring"
" @ViktorAl-o9z  Yeah, but both business models are profitable and Wuwa's devs only stand out because how bad Hoyo's are... that being said, Wuwa's not perfect just because the devs are good. It's a 7/10, I'd accept someone giving it an 8/10. It's good, great even, not perfect"
" @destinystriumph1573  I wouldn't say Wuwa stands out because of Hoyo, but because it was a terrible, incredibly disastrous launch that greatly affected the start of the game, which made the developers beg the players to stay, listening to their every wish :)
ZZZ is doing something similar now"
" @ViktorAl-o9z I’m sorry but no gacha game can be a perfect game, gacha games by design are predatory and can’t ever be perfect"
 @KT-qk9ip  so... explain how wuwa is perfect then?
"​ @AaAldi-vr3fe bro those dogsmack, already quit long time ago cause he is a wuwa loyal dog"
" @AaAldi-vr3fe  I love how you're saying that ""Make some money"" like Hoyoverse isn't already drowning in it.

And yeah if WuWa follows suit then they deserve the same kind of criticism Star rail and Genshin is getting right now."
" @ViktorAl-o9z  Clueless, Wuwa devs care about money and know that they can't fuck up after the disastrously 1.x"
"@zakariamimouni279 please, don't open your mouth if you don't know anything about the company's history and growth over the years. But, it's not like I expect much from people like you tbh lol 🤏"
"guys this ViktorAI dude is just being sarcastic bruh, he literally makes fun of those typical die hard fans that thought their beloved game is the best, and Yes Wuwa also has these types of fans. At this point, every single product always have their dedicated, selfless, fanatical maniacs. I mean a band as niche as Tool can also have that. No need to be deep in thought and act like a product is bad because it has die hard fanatics with childish mentality 💀💀"
I’ve learned today just how many people can’t pick up internet sarcasm these days.
Just CCs and addicts. They want everything to stay as 1.0.
As a f2p i can't just ignore it like it gives free pulls why the f i will ignore the endgame??
But what exactly is to play besides MOC after you are sone with story quests??? Wtf you be on bro... There's nothing to play in this game other than MoC once you are done with story quest which isn't even enjoyable as it's all black screen and white texts
 @Why_AreYou  do yourself a favour and stop playing this game. It’s designed to suck your money and make you care about things that mean nothing. You loose nothing from missing out on 1 pull every 40 days. It’s a trap that eventually becomes a massive time sink. I am light spender and I just play this game for the story and I can even clear MOC from time to time. But it’s not my end all or be all.
 @Ayush-kc2vx  unnecessary being the keyword I never said don’t do MOC. It’s just not the be all or end all of this game.
"​ @Why_AreYou play DU/SU or grind achievements, or even play another game, this can't be your only game. I mean you don't have to play HSR all the time bro, this game is just a side casual game which we play often only during early patch update. Also its not easy to add tons of quality contents within 40 days EVERY update. I choose HSR cause i don't want to grind all day, just wanna grind first week then just chilling doing dailies/weekly and IRL"
This is always the dumbest type of comment
You're just clueless
" @CultureAdd1ct no, dumbest comment here was you."
 @frappuchieno  nope
"As long as the Chinese community doesn't make a move, Hoyo won't make changes since it's pretty obvious they're the target market. Just like Sweetily said most Chinese aren't bothered by the global buffs compared to global"
​@Galahad-x8hyour first comparison is not correct. 1hp vs a percentage. Also it fits her lore and gameplay wise. They could easily add more revives on other units would you still say the same thing
"@Galahad-x8h Many units have a revive and in most content that revive is useless end game anyways since you need heals or a shielder and if you're dying then you may as well reset anyways im sure some runs might get saved or have less resets to clear but it doesn't matter for most playres actually doing end game and story content is generally easy enough that you don't need that either. 
The issue is the later implementations of global passives"
The issue is that this opens the door for future global passives because people like you are saying this one is fine
" @Noggintoggin  I never said it's fine though, all I'm saying is if these are required to clear content then the game is truly far too gone"
"​ @Noggintoggin creating more powerful global passives is going to shoot them in the foot twice. They not only lose income, they will also struggle to control the powercreep here so no. The idea or using global passives will destroy them in the long run here. For now, let's wait for 3.3, if we don't get any global passives, we can guranteed say only anniversary waifus get them only"
"​@Galahad-x8hnobody would go to eidolons just for revives, revives are pointless, in moc you lose the 3 stars if someone dies anyway so not dying is kind of a thing you might want to do castorice passive will never proc for me, I will never see it happen ever"
"@Galahad-x8h  still that is a super niche case, nearly nobody will think oh of going to go for e2 just for the revive, and while I understand you still get max stars, the goal is still to not have characters dying and if your a competent player you shouldn't have anyone dying ever unless you are using your healers wronf"
"@Galahad-x8h  no because a competent player would still not die in the first place, and most likely if your in the situation where your usingnyour healers incorrectly tour not just going to die once your going to have multiple deaths throughout the fight and the passive can only proc once, it's still a completely useless passive"
"I mean i can comfortably clear endgame with my E0S0 Seele who's not seen relic farming in 1 and a half years. (Seele, 3b, Sparkle, FX, not even speed tuned 3 cycles MoC12, HP inflation does exist but I only used 1 single busted unit which has limited synergy with the DPS and it's easily a passing grade). In other words, yes global passive bad design but as with powercreep and HP inflation the problem is blown vastly out of proportions.
Personally I'll have to see how much better hyacine is than ghallager once the dreams of 3.3 start rolling in that'll determine if I skip cas or not cuz I ain't pulling that shit."
@123FireSnake  not gonna lie shell probably be synergistic with casto and have some way of healing like bailou does
"No, you wont. You will keep moving the goalposts because of sunk cost fallacy. People said the same thing when resistances meant something."
" @kash1Mz  nah once it's like that it's gg's for me, besides I treat hsr more like a side game like clash of clans anyways, I ain't afraid to let it go"
" @Salientspeaker56  3.3 deep test kit is already out, no global passive"
"that's the thing, it'll never happen lmao"
He's smacking again?😆
He is going back to Monster hunter worlds 😭
This revelation is not new. Trust me.
 @Orthrus02  just wanted to say it to all the babies
well he is also tired as all heal streaming for 10+ hours and then getting in a call after
"Not to mention many of those Chinese gamers are millionaires, they could literally fund hsr non stop"
"we have no idea about the financial side of things and no data to confirm that, as for players I doubt 50 million or so are cn players only, theres japan, korea, europe and the US and theres like 3-4 billion plus people in total and over 60 million players."
 @yulfine1688  You think this game has 60 million ACTIVE players in 2025? lmaooo
"​ @iamAdrian_56 currently active monthly amount is around 21 million players, globally theres around 60 million players doesnt mean theyre always playing. 

Genshin has like 3x that or more despite its issues... so yeah"
 @yulfine1688  proof?
"​ @iamAdrian_56 you can google the info for yourself, however we cant know how many in china for example play. 

Unless the devs give official numbers sites that estimate guess. 

The last 30 days suggest around 21 million active players up from januarys 19 million. 

You have to factor all platforms which makes it harder from pc, to cn, console etc."
" @yulfine1688  I I think billions is too much, it's like you're saying 50% of human population are playing hoyo games"
"​ @Shinra0629 no im saying the population is roughly that between those areas.

Theres 60 million or so total players unless i mistyped which is possible. 
There's roughly 21 million players active monthly."
"That’s the thing, westerners make everything about them. Some random small CC tried to sic the CN/JP community on hoyoverse “to get them to change things”. Like what??"
Future update characters got a new global passive that deletes en complainer
Meta has absolutely nothing to do with this issue and I don’t understand why people always need to justify “ I pull for I like” while missing the point that they’re just bad in general
​ @amari7782  you haven't even seen it develop. Lets just go back to the power level of 1.0 and stay like that. Either you haven't played any other gachas or everything to remain stale.
" @deviant315l6   I’ve played many other gacha games and I can tell you that HSR power creep is such a problem because the game at its core is terrible even by turn based gacha standards ( this is coming from someone who’s played since beta 2)

When power creep happens in other games it’s because of interactive mechanics between enemy and player

For example fgo with its countless racism buff on top of them BUFFING older characters 

Limbus company constantly gives new units that fill out archetypes.

For some examples

Again all the points people try to make about other gacha don’t apply to as many as people want to believe and even then the ones that do qualify are some mostly obscure titles average gacha players won’t know about so what are u trying to prove"
"@ You are right. Since meta has nothing to do with this issue, why are people making a fuss ? You said it is bad, please elaborate."
"@ it’s primarily because pushing global passives in the form of characters instead of how other gachas do it which is just a free grindable system basically just says to hoyo that they can make characters as non f2p as they want

Whether its make more 5 stars with these effects, scaling content with the intent of needing to roll these units ( which mobs or not) or potentially moving these ideas to their other games"
"@I always feel that whether to roll for a limited 5-star character/weapon is up to the player. HYV is not forcing anyone to pull anything. There is no must-pull character/weapon. As a F2P from the day of release of HSR, other than 3.0 onwards, I have all the supports (except Jiaoqiu) and substains (except Huohuo). My teams do not need the revival global passive of Castorice but I’m still pulling for her because I like her design. 
Global passives are beneficial to my teams as that means I do not need to level up characters to use the passives.
Imagine buffs, Energy Regen, Shields, Heals are in character passives, maybe then, I just need to bring dpsers and don’t need to pull so many characters. A bit far-fetched but even if it happens, we are probably at the end of HSR journey."
"@ at that point why not just actually do wat other games do and just make a free system that does the exact same thing?

The issue is the fact that they’d rather go the scummiest way possible just sell more characters rather than make interesting systems that have proven to work to make the game more interesting.

You could easily do way more with standalone systems but instead they chose the worst way possible cuz they know no one is going to complain"
"@ I’ve already pointed out why I feel it is beneficial to me. Why must every game copy one another ? If anyone is not happy with a game, just quit and play other games."
" @andrinaleong4079  it’s almost like having a good system is just good to have  in any game. 

Again the point I’m getting at is why not just make it a whole system that accomplishes the same goal instead of just making characters each with a passive like this?"
"@ I wouldn’t like it as it gives me the feeling of repetition (or copying) of other games. For example, I started open-world game with Genshin and when I tried Wuthering Waves, I had a hard time going through 1.X because the feeling of playing Genshin again, comes in. Even looking at the WuWa interface (menus) gives me that feeling and it is quite unbearable. I believe if I had started with WuWa (or other open-world games) first, it would give me the same unenjoyable experience. I do not like to play games that have things/systems that are too similiar."
"@ because other games already have it ? I already said I would not like this to be implemented as I don’t like games to copy one another.
Also when people complain in the feedback, I hope that they do suggest an alternative solution to the problem.  Talking is easy, solving problem is not.
Anyway, there is no point discussing this topic any further as everyone has his/her own opinion. I’ll stick to mine."
@ I love how you want an alternative solution when I literally just told you wat the alternative solution is but you’re too busy focusing on the idea of them copying it from other games.
most real shit anyone has said 😭ly bro
"i don't get it, why are you talking like you know what hoyo is going to do? what makes you confident in saying that? if they did it once why wouldn't they do it again?"
"Do you seriously think this is a one time thing? This game has shown time and time again they will powercreep everything and powercreep it aggressively in order to maximise profit.

They will monetise this further, hell they even monetised the anniversary rewards. You cannot be so blind to not have foresight.

They've shown you their business model and yet you want to pretend they won't follow it out of the kindness of their hearts?"
how do you know they won't add more global passives to characters as they releases them?
 @9019fran  fr tho we for sure getting more global passives and i bet they will stack with each other too
hahahahaha
"Saying they will not make more global passives is like saying that after acheron nobody had a game-changing E2 ever. Yeah right.
They tested the idea of an early busted E2 with acheron and went and gave everyone and their mama an insane E2. Cast is a global passive test and there is zero reason to not give the later characters even more insane passives. But its a nice cope to think hoyo are so nice to make this a one off thing"
We are 100% getting a global passive by the end of this year.
@ i hear some of the fate characters might have global passives as well
The global passive already has its own UI so I guess they gonna release more in the future and I'm sure it's some broken passives that will adjust the endgame 💀
 @HarzinLolz  no you don't because theres no information about their kits...
 @tempestu2676  I mean yes it would have its own UI because its a basic UI and animation but that's for castorice specifically dataminers have not provided any information of any further units having one but yes its possibly others probably the next anniversary will.
 @yulfine1688  how do you know what i know
 @yulfine1688  also how do you know they won't add global passives to other characters. if one character has one then others probably will as well.
"What about they step up the scale if hoyo plan to introduce this ? Sharing global passive to friend you choose. Global active skill (like blessing skill 
,yin DU)."
@  thats gonna be a problem if   you have multiple global passive characters
" @Alm0nd_T0fuO3  This is absurd, e2 dhil already was the first heavy eidolon investment dps and it literally passed 1 entire version for another character to have a game changer e2. From my point of view, global passive are going reserved for heavy lore characters, like maybe for 2 more characters on the enterity of 3.x. Like phainon and probably fate collab. Right know, from 36 limited, only ff, acheron, feixiao and maaybe dhil have game changing e2. The rest are not even close in terms of value. So ""everyone and their mama"" is basically instigating for fun lmao"
"People are saying that this incentivizes greedier practices. It’s not about what the global passive. It’s about the implication of what HoYo KNOWS what they can get away with when they release characters. The goalpost always gets moved. It may seem like a nothing burger now, but eventually, powercreep will start affecting global passives as well. And it’ll be to the point where not having a unit will place your account behind."
 @TacticalDimples  that is what am saying
This is literally just wrong. Other units are getting the global passive lmao. Theres already like 4 other global passives leaked lmao
 @9019fran quit the game then lmfao
"@ i did, though i don't see how that has anything to do with what i said"
🤡
"Chat clip this, be back in 1 year when we have multiple characters with global passives."
 @9019fran what makes YOU confident that you know what you’re talking about and what hoyoverse is going to do? Do you work there? Do you see the future? Or just play their games like the rest of us?
" @jisforjae  i have never stated that though, i just said that if they did it once, why wouldn't they do it again?

and well, 3 more global passives have been leaked already (including one fate character), maybe true maybe not, but most of the time leaks have been correct"
"This didn't age well lol
And how the freak is a free revive on all characters from the account not game breaking lol 
I love the game but we have to be honest just having castorice in my account would forever change the way I play the game for the only reason that playing with 2 buffer wasn't viable since one of my characters would probably die before the end of the fight but now is easy for me but what about the guy that would miss 3.2?"
Damn you have too much hope when powercreep exist
"The entire issue is literally the precedent it sets

Do you actually think they'll never add another Global Passive that isn't better? People like you are exactly what Hoyo wants, absolutely 0 critical thinking and just writing off everything as pointless complaining"
"mmm ok, I se—WHAT 

(effective bait)"
Dude that is way too overpowered.
It will be funny if its like 10% credits on simulated universe that will be hilarous and a slap in the face for the complainers 😂
Haha
I want to disclose that the global buff will most likely be balanced out i mean imagine if 9 characters has a global buff your account will most likely be allowed to only choose one to use at a time so it really isnt that bad in this regard
 @firasj0826  so what if global passives stack as characters are released tho?
" @firasj0826  And if they do let you use all the global passive, i think it's still ok, as i said, if global passive isn't the main reason for you to win the game, then that's fine.
F2p can win normally, and p2w will get a e6s5 anyway"
"​ @firasj0826  based on what? People said most likely it will get reverted before v2 of the beta and look how that turned out.

Do you seriously think they will deactivate people's abilities they paid for? Ofcourse not, they want as much money as possible so they're going to release more of these characters to pull and if they allow them to stack it gives you less reason to skip if you like you're existing passive."
"Not sure if Acheron’s tech counts as a “global passive” if it only works with her on the team, let alone input to activate it. A passive doesn’t require input.

Acheron’s technique at least requires her to be on the team. Castorice revive does not. She just needs to exist on the account period.

Its not entirely the end of the world about it, at least to me, but I understand why it can be seen as a dark precedent for the future units that come with passives that work outside the team."
"@AvertBurden  my bad, i should be clear.
What i wanna said is a similar situation with acheron and castorice. 
For acheron, she's for exploring map and play simulated universe easier, but you can play without her; for castorice, she's use for avoiding your team accidentally died and need to restart the game, but if you do build your sustain well, you can also play without her.
For people who said castorice global passive destroying HSR, are stupid. What really matter is they keep giving out tons of  character with global passive, or make global passive too op.

Will Mihoyo know these too and change? IDK, lets see."
@ the reasons i think they will only allow one active at a time is simply because stacking these buffs will literally break the game if i thought of adding this then i will simply give it to a new character and to the trailblazer and allow one at a time i dont know though how they will work with the buff but 100% they wont allow them to stack since this will break the game
"For one, you have no idea if they ""wont give global passives to every unit"". Two, Acheron does not have a global passive."
" @firasj0826   No, that would defeat the whole purpose of them"
"⁠ @CultureAdd1ct since you seem to be an expert, are YOU know hoe many global passives will release in the future? because as things stand castorice is the only confirmed case, whats to say that we wont have another one untill version 4. global passive doomshilling is always ""if"" and ""when"" 

also functionally acheron's technique gives you a global advantage, you can utilize its effects of insta killing mobs but just slotting her in and then swapping off, an advantage which doesnt exist if you dont own her"
​ @yesno4326 can you use Acheron ability in moc/pf/apo I say castorice global passive same as ruan mei passive but the different is she only work in su if castorice passive didn't work in the end game content trust me no one would complain she gives advantage even it's little it's still is and she only need to exist on the account
PEAK COMEDY 🎉🎉
we knew a month plus ago about it to be honest anyone who paid attnetions to leaks but no dataminers have suggest anything else there are fake leaks for phainon or hyacine apparently claiming they have global buffs or something
nah agree w the rest but if tectone was in there id rather shoot myself then listen to him complain about nothing for hours
bro commented pure facts 🗣🔥🔥
"To be fair Brax was also playing wizardry Daphne so bro probably wasn’t caring too much about the conversation 
Also I think he’s at a point and most of them are at a point where no one really cares"
You already said asia gacha mentality is cooked so why are western players try to change it? and if they add tectone and gacha smack the end result will be they will just agree on tectone and gacha smack without giving their own opinions on the matter because lets be honest when talking to tectone or gacha smack any slightly positive opinion u have on this will be downplay immediately
"@ it’s one of 2 things

Everyone will agree for the sake of them just being brick walls

Or gacha smack and the gang are just going to say the most obvious stuff and act like it’s the most profound seeds of wisdom"
"Asia players are beyond cooked? Accepting horrendous gacha practices? Because first thing’s first. Why would you even play a gacha game if you hate being cooked? You westerners are the only yappers like you have so many say in a certain thing. The skin color, the nationality of a certain character, the skills, the passive and so many more. Us (most) asia players are so chill while you guys are being pathetic, ungrateful 💩 Westerner tourists are always free to leave, board the plane and adios!"
"@ what can I say man, I speak nothing but the truth that everybody is too afraid to say. 

This guy is the biggest hypocrite in all of Hoyo CCs and is a worse case than Enviosity, his community is so obnoxiously hoyo-pilled that they make Enviosity's community look pale in comparision. The toxic positivity, and heavy undermining of the problems in HSR has gotten so out of hand and it's thanks to this guy and his fanbase. 
Truly a shame to see HSR go down a route way worse than Genshin ever did mainly thanks to the devs but community-wise thanks to this guy."
 @JokerOfCards   imagine calling someone hypocrite because he likes and genuinely enjoy the game bro is this the influence of dumb CCs you've been watching? first calling asia gacha mentality cooked and now calling mrpokke and his communities hypocrite? holy
"@ Yes he is a hypocrite, and it's very obvious to anyone with a brain. His twitter posts are back and forth of ""I don't war just peace"" into the most instigative, ragebait, or straight up shit takes over and over again. He also said he would not roll on Castorice if the global passive actually goes to live but I'm sure he's getting E6S5 when his cult of a community ""funds his pulls"" and he claims that his ""community forced him to e6s5 her"" like he did with other super hyped units. 
Also he's sure as heck doing his hardest to defend HSR following the 3.2 stream on his twitter, by either memeing on global passives undermining the core problem or calling out the CCs that spoke against it.
If you still think I'm calling this guy a hypocrite because ""he genuinely enjoys a game"", then we can end the conversation right here. 


Asia gacha mentality is cooked, legit don't see what's wrong with what I said there? The amount of predatory gacha practices they willingly accept because of their horrendous addiction to gacha games, PVP and wanting to always be competitive is why they're beyond cooked. I mean there's a reason they won't give a single damn about Castorice global passive, heck I'm sure they're celebrating it because they love predatory trash like this. 

I already explained why Mr. Jokke is a hypocrite, as for his community they're straight up a significantly more obnoxious hoyo-infested chat than Enviosity's community ever was, which is just beyond insane. To give you ONE example out of the numerous ones, just look at the whole Castorice global passive situation, and how they're treating it. They constantly meme on it to undermine it, constantly shit on all the other CCs that actually try to speak up actively call out how horrible of a change it is and the precedence it sets for the game (for example look at GachaSmack's video and the perception it had from Mr.Jokke's pathetic community when 95% of smack's vid was straight up calling things how they are, you legit outed yourself as one of that obnoxious horde by calling them ""dumb CCs"" LMAO), and constantly attack ANYONE that dares to criticize their holy perfect game. They aren't just obnoxious massive whiteknights, they are also pretty damn aggressive about it. Honestly, it is disgusting to look at."
 @JokerOfCards  it’s wild how HSR had so much good faith with the community only to burn it all in a year
"@ I mean that's the Hoyo cycle isn't it? First it was Genshin, then it went to HSR with them baiting us by making us think they're different from Genshin, only for it to be signiciantly worse. I GUARANTEE you ZZZ will be next in a year or two, given how based we think ZZZ devs are only for the cycle to repeat itself. 

People have to start waking up and realize Hoyo is the scummiest of the scummiest game companies in the world, and to never ever place trust in anything they do."
" @JokerOfCards  first of all when did he said his not going to pull for castorice when the global buff is release too? show me proof then i believe you plus its pretty obvious he did because it was for content like bro what?

Second if u watch his recent livestream he talks about the if CCs were to pulled for castorice it will affect how viewers sees them if they pull they will be called hypocrite and if they did not then they will be praised but also on other hand the people that genuinely like castorice or likes the game will they also be called hypocrite? dumb? or hoyoshills?

Lastly, its pretty obvious the CCs that u watch their influence will also affects you u know there is a saying that goes the ""CCs reflects their communities"" gacha smack and tectone though they have pretty good mindset on all this but they consider people or players that enjoy the game dumb and hypocrite just like whats happening right now, so tell me why are the people who really likes game gets affected by this?"
"Pretty much this. Since global passive was confirmed to be in the game, HSR is cooked and they just cannot remove it at all anymore. 
This livestream serves as a soft filter to some players, if you can't accept the current state of HSR then quit right now otherwise shut up, accept the fact this is how this game will unfortunately be and keep playing."
Yep that's it. Hoyo don't give a f. Uninstall.
Unfortunately ppl won't do either of these two. They'll keep complaining or hating the game and still playing it.
Please quit and uninstall. You're doing hsr playerbase a huge favor
 @raidenyato  If you care so much about the game that you would uninstall it because of a change in the pvp system they why the hell even play. Pvp was never the great part about the game ???
I'll suck it up if they implement global passive to every single character that exists in the game. Yes every single one. 4 star and standard 5 star included.
Or just enjoy the game
 @raidenyato just uninstall it and shut up
"If you’re not from the major spenders, which is China, then stop the yap. They dont gaf. You westerners are the only weird thing in every gacha games"
​@bendefreude8013the game dosent have pvp
"They listened on buffing old characters. They listened on adjusting the storytelling. It's very clear that the players' voices matter on this in a way that they do not with Genshin Impact because Genshin has a huge swath of players that love the game as is. HSR doesn't have that. WuWa doesn't have that. ZZZ doesn't have that. They do have to listen because the people complaining are a much larger portion of the playerbase.

Castorice's global passive, if they stop making new global passives in the future, would not kill the game."
" @eckology016  well that’s the thing. The fate collab characters and Phainon were already leaked to have global passives, and those are not something useless like Casto’s revive"
"@ Nono, you have it all wrong. They didn't listen to buffing old characters, they just want to give you the ILLUSION that they did. It was addressed from 3.0 and that we'd atleast get some major news by 3.2 only for them to mention it in a SINGLE sentence and to postpone it to 3.4. This is pathetic, extremely pathetic. 

Adjusting the storytelling STILL isn't officially in the game, and they've taught me to never take whatever they say for granted thanks to their empty promises or straight up blatant lies so I won't believe it until I experience the improvements myself in the future patches. 

And we really should stop with the cope around Castorice's global passive, istg this MrDookie guy's community is so hoyo-pilled they make up the most delusional takes revolving this passive. They WILL make more global passives, they WILL be way stronger and beneficial and they WILL stack. It's a horrible precedence, I know it you know it everybody knows it but unfortunately many hoyo-whiteknights are turning a blind eye. Then once things turn out exactly the way many people with above room temp IQ said it would, it would have been way too late. 

HSR devs do not give a single damn about what the players think, they never did. They want to make people think that they care but really they don't."
​ @itzmeKinto you an complain while still playing. Im sure at your workplace you have complaints but instead of leaving you still stay.
I feel that I really do not care about global passive and I am not going to pull for Cas 😂
​ @redlove8861  Why would I stay? If I don't like the environment of my workplace or complain about how my boss is bitch then I quit. Isn't that normal thing to do?
"Truth lol, its clear hoyo wont bother at all with criticism or survey. There's no need to keep playing if you hate it, and for those who do, well, good for them too."
"Lmao, kinda sad that you can't have the third option for this company. Even if you like the game and want it to get better, it's either stay in the rot or full abandonment and never the option to make them change. Stagnation Path is actually true and real. 💀"
That doesn’t matter and if it needs to be PvP to justify being made then that’s just downright stupid
"Even outside of gacha games, westerners really love to complain 😅"
Yep. First MoC too easy then too hard. Thi character too strong then too weak like end game is the only content when even missing 3 stars on each one gives you 1-3 pulls.
"Yep, en hoyo community just sucks. Jp and Cn are so much better."
"Some other gachas already have this theres no ""cause other gachas to do anything"""
"Yes that's the main concern however so far dataminers have not provided anything suggesting any other units at least in 3.x to have any sort of global passive, plus while many are rather indifferent to it, CN isn't afraid to jump ship and attack the company and a lot of their players are free to play as well if not a larger portion or they're light spenders who spend here and there most are not whales that's always a minority."
"1. Global buffs been in mobile games for 15 plus years
2.thinking game will be designed around global buffs is intellectually dishonest when the game isn't designed around e6s5"
"The sooner people realize this only effect endgame and 99% of the rest of the game will be fine. Everybody should know gacha endgame is the only place they can realistically make ""p2w"" since few people care about it to begin with and its not locking story or events from you. You can still clear content as f2p in endgame without Castorice. 

A lot of people were saying you needed Ruan Mei or Robin to clear back in the day but they got proven wrong too when they were about the closest thing to an account buff you could get since between both of them every single kind of team trivialized the game back than."
Maybe try contributing to the conversation instead of just leeching views from other creators?
Holy yap vods
mr yapper waited 20 minutes for his yapping to begin
"Jenazad was pretty much right, the casual fanbase (which is like 99% of the HSR playerbase) gives zero fucks about the implications of the global passive.

The only ones it'll deeply hurt in the long run are those who are way too kneedeep into gacha as a culture (and this is like the mega minority in the modern gacha space as a whole nowadays).

You can bitch and doom, but for so as long as the 1st paragraph of what Jenazad said exists, nobody will care to change anything."
Literally yap session
"There is 3 more this version, can’t wait to see the reaction to them.😅"
"For now there's nothing we can do,just gonna accept the global passive thing,they won't hear our opinions or take the Qol from the player,unless from the OG country itself,I'm worried about the future of this game,but still,let pray and hope its going well,HSR still one of my favourite game,and still going too play no matter what,just gonna enjoy the game ,ignore those things like it's doesn't even exist.."
Idk if this was mentioned or not but we didnt really see how would multiple global works work right? I mean why do people assume that they will stack in the first place? I actually think that there will be just limit of 1 working global passive and that's it. It would be funny cus then all this drama is really for nothing. I dont think there will be 50+ working global passives or smth
Word of the day chat?
Holy wow
"Thats exactly the point, endgane is a side hustke non required to progress hsr as a f2p experience, you only pay if you want for extras and thats it. Listening to whining on ""ruining the experience"" is just bullcrap"
"This is just stupid mindest, cause the problem isn't the castorice global passive effect, the problem is that this now let's the FLOOD GATES OPEN to global passives in general 

I wouldn't put it past them if they decide to make some account passive like ""ur team bow ignores 15% defense"" OR ""Action advances all allies 100% at start of battle"""
"@Accountthatexists Yes you wouldn't put it past them but are those mechanics in the game now? If you speculate about the future you can imagine literally anything like a character who automatically generate stellar jades in your account daily or  ensure your relics roll into whatever stat you want once per week. 

Most people arguments are bonkers gamebreaking mechanics. HSR devs are literally scared of Dance Dance Dance lightcone and eagle set. THey won't even powercreep them because they already break the game as is and probably would not have been made right now had they known its effects on the game."
"that's not the point, the point is There's going to be more global passive which is more op than reviving which is attack or speed or defense, HP, etc. That's the problem, it's not just castorice, it's about the future of the game, the upcoming more global passive"
"@Accountthatexists Those extreme example are the same as ""If i step outside my house a plane will crash right on top of me!"""
​@Accountthatexistsbro acts like they are gonna bring back Acheron insta kill in MOC back❤
" @kennethyoung7457  i don't think you're getting the actual point, yes, the examples he gave were exaggerated, but the point is that before that wasn't even a POSSIBILITY because global passives were NOT a thing, now since they are a thing, it has become a possibility that something along those lines would exist (i doubt something as broken as that, but maybe idk) and that's good for absolutely no one really, besides hoyo becasue they maybe make more money because of it idk"
"​ @kennethyoung7457 The fact they are ""scared"" about that as you say, is because everyone can have access to them without paying them. You can't really compare a 4-star LC and a farmable set Vs Limited Characters. Gallagher himself had probably been one of their most ""failed"" creations for the sole fact he is way too good. They are not on our side."
 @9019fran  I mean if they just wanted money they could sell skins thats way easier money from all types of players instead of only making a mechanics that meta focused player would care about.
" @melowmelow99  Gallagher is quite balanced he was made with supporting the new meta in mind of attack frequency, break and debuffs. Without gallagher many people wouldn't have a good f2p option for characters like Acheron, Firefly or Feixiao which were the ""main"" dps units of 2.x.

 They also made Remembrance MC for free and they are more cracked than. They make f2p character really good now because thats the power level they need to be worth using."
you don't need it for end game either in fact its mostly useless there you have unlimited tries in runs.. and if you're dying in your end game runs you're already doing something wrong anyways so it doesn't matter that's not the issue the issue is global passives that start providing damage buffs or something or if they add pvp.. which I also don't see happening to be honest.
"thats true ive survived whole 2.x versions without Robin, Aventurine, Huo Huo was able to clear all endgame. and now in 3.x im still doing okay without THerta and Aglea. in fact i didnt pulled any 3.x character yet"
"@ So do you think people would be complaining if they were making skins? I believe every single person would prefer that alternative.

Gallagher is by far the best 4 star in the game in my opinion, they also made Match 8th, wich also is a godsend for F2P players and even competes with Topaz on Feixiao comps, and the MC is really cracked, with his only downside being you can only have 1 type of MC at a time (Wich is fair)

But I really cannot find any justifiable measure to implement a game mechanic that applies in combat without said character that has the mechanics even being in your daam active team.

If we would use the lore acurate reason they used in the stream, we could use the same argument for every single other character that has a major role, ""Numby can be in any team cuz Topaz lends him to you"", ""Fu Xuan can negate 1 team wide attack cuz she predicated it before the fight started"" and all the other bullshit reasons they can come up with. If every single character is limited to active team slots, why in god's green earth should any other character not be?"
Bro is sungjinwoo
He was busy Aura farming
Tbf he probably wanted to make a more informed take so he doesn’t go down the greedy and stupid route😅
Arise.... (Sniffa!)
Man expanded his domain of yap 🤣
"I'm so glad this update is filtering out all of the annoying people. Like, nobody cares that you're quitting. They'll probably be back in 2 months from now because they want to satisfy their gambling addiction"
What's funny to me is that they're announcing that they're quitting as if like people would care to begin with 😅😅 They're literally the Mourning Actors 😭🤣
​@idontspeakjapanese6289 they need validation that what they are doing is right. 100% insecure people.
what are you smoking? lmao
"I think it’s right and wrong at the same time, yes 90% of the player base are casuals, inside it there is mega casuals up to almost non casual gamers, they don’t give a shit that’s for sure, then you have the try harders or non casual gamers who cares a lot and inside it the ones who can make a difference are the Whales but they won’t and the rest has literally no impact."
"We're not smoking anything, we're talking in Layman's terms ​ @CultureAdd1ct "
" @MuB3ta  game isn’t going to die, but it will get worse and worse over time. Genshin is an example of this. Better yet, HI3 is an even better example because HSR feels like it’s doing what HI3 was doing in the past. Yeah, it may not matter a much now, but overtime, you’ll start to really feel it. Always needing to pull for new characters + their gear to keep up. It’s not a good thing if you plan to play the game long term. And you’ll start to realize that the game favors newcomers over veterans."
yea like why care anyway? this is single-player game! play whenever you like!
 @MuB3ta you’re glad that people calling out a company for evil practices are gone so that… they can implement more without scrutiny 😂 sure the Gacha industry is inherently predatory doesn’t mean it needs to become more predatory
"Naaah... casuals aren't the ones spending money though, maybe the majority of the casuals don't care. But people who invest into their account like Mrpokkes peeps are def gonna make an impact"
I hate this opinion because it shames you for caring. Someone doesn't have to be a gambling addict to love Star Rail and have a line in the sand they feel is important and worth speaking up over. Yeah a lot of people don't care abd that's reality but it's literally no reason to patronize anyone who wants to speak up hoping others and Hoyo will care. It's not just people with ego and addiction.
" @lukebruton4110  it's a gacha game. If you get emotional and angry over the unimportant things in life like a game company adding something ""unfair"" to a single player game that already uses dirty practices, you need to reevaluate your life."
 @MuB3ta  How dare a person be a upset over a game he likes to play! You should be like Mub3ta who's a monk that is just zen on everything in life!
 @lukebruton4110  blud yapping as if he had to pay to play this game :face-blue-smiling:
Enjoy your game in the future when all that is left are casual f2ps that don't spend a dime in the game. Have fun with hoyo being moe lazy than they are now in the near future lmao
 @Haerin1397  why would the people who spend money quit playing this game? Whales won't care if castorice has a global passive because they can just get e6s5 of whatever character and clear everything that way. The people who are complaining are mostly Western players in the vocal minority and I'm sure they haven't spent a dime compared to the Asian players who make up 80-90% of hoyo's revenue.
"​ @Haerin1397  Also, Genshin is still one of the highest earning gacha games and it caters to casual players... Yet the whales are still spending"
 @MuB3ta so this update is filtering out the people that actually want to put the game to a standard and want a good game?
" @adogewithwifi1652   the game will be fine, and the world will keep spinning. It's no big deal. The casual players that play for an hour or two a day won't care because they don't grind and maximize everything, the players who spend money frequently won't care care because they can just get castorice or get eidolons for any character they want and clear the content that way. What's this passive really going to do in a single player game? Like, oh boy... You cleared moc one cycle faster because your dps tanked a powerful blow and now you get 1 extra turn.. and even then someone without castorice can just click two buttons to restart the run."
"@ Wow, what a surprise! The apple of gacha games aren't suddenly going bankrupt?!? Well yeah, they're still going to be one of the highest earning, it's not like they suddenly lose all the revenue they have that they can put towards the game. Talk about the DECLINE compared to previous patches if we are talking about a company like Hoyo. You just proved my point: you need other people who play the game other than story gooning like yourselves because u know damn well it's not going to survive the same way it's been doing"
" @lukebruton4110  ""Filtering annoying people"" but its not in skill or intellect, in gambling addiction brainrot lmao"
 @Haerin1397 brother. Genshin is still alive and bigger than WuWa even though WuWa is objectively the better game. The casuals don’t give a fuck. It’s the sad truth
"@ Like I said, it's not going to die. It's hoyo, they're a billion dollar company with the army of shills. They sure will not like it when their revenue goes downhill (which it already has since natlan)"
" @Haerin1397 in fact the casuals are those that can spend on the game as most of them or like me got jobs and which we can afford to spend.
Also sadly to say those that has big complains are usually the f2p casuals that brings no income to the company"
" @randomboi1959 in fact casuals are working adults which they can afford to spend or even whale if their income is high.
Those f2p casuals are just part of the big casual group."
" @randomboi1959  casuals aret the ONES that spends money the most, there are literally hundreds and even thousands of players out there that are working adults that can just dump their salaries on to the game"
"​ @MuB3ta you are probably the guy who justifies spending money for a pixel on a screen over a marriage ceremony. Sad, youre a lost cause. Condolences to you."
@zekeaffy9647  what does that have to do with anything? If you have nothing of value to say then don't bother me.
"​@MuB3ta  it's not just the fact that people want things to be better. Honkai Star Rail started off as the gacha game that was better and a step forward, and it's disappointing to see the game take a step back almost every other patch. Hoyo ""filtering"" people is not even healthy for the game, it's really not far from having a reputation that will steer people away from wanting to get into it"
" @jackiecianura  
Who decided that the game is going backwards? Maybe you? As a HSR player, I don't think the game is getting worse, personally it provides the same experience as a year ago, as before 2.0 
Why did you decide that your opinion is the only correct one?"
​ @adogewithwifi1652  that standard is not up to the players to hold. What the fuck did you do to earn that right?
"@tdof7217  how will this steer new players from getting into hsr? I think if a new player were to start playing during 3.2 and they pulled castorice with their beginner rewards it would help them in the long run and make combat more comfy. I'm tired of seeing people commenting about how they're going to quit and how hsr is going to die. We all know that at least 90% of them are lying and only doing it for attention because they either quit playing hsr awhile ago, or never even played or tried the game in the first place and just want to see the game burn. Or they're not actually quitting and are just mad because they aren't castorice fans and they have to watch the castorice enjoyers get extra benefits."
 @ViktorAl-o9z   Stupid people with stupid opinions :v I'm not sure if people who always complain are actually playing the game or not
" @TacticalDimples  One of the many reasons why HSR will never be like HI3 is because HSR doesn't have a PvP/Scoring/Leaderboard system. If you remove the need to score very high just to retain your rankings or compete with the leaderboard in Hi3, there will be little to no need to pull very often for the new units. In HSR, 36 stars already means Nirvana in HI3 since you get the maximum possible reward, and that's with a 10-cycle allowance. Not clearing floor 12 means you just lose on 80 jades which is similar to just being in RL or Agony, and that's fine, almost everyone is fine with that."
 @randomboi1959 you haven’t seen Chinese players bro…link at least 50%-40% spend on the game as casuals.
@ And not to mention they are the main target market of Hoyo and where they get most of their money.
"​ @MuB3ta man there are many games much better than HSR for those gambling addicts. In the end, you think this game is the top game when its only top in the Revenue (well, it's steadily declining) and that only shows how predatory this game is."
 @MuB3ta  LMAOO real
"​ @megumin9967  when did I ever say anything about hsr being the ""best game""? I can recognize this game has flaws and it's far from perfect (hp inflation, story bloat, lack of animation, etc). This community has become a cesspool for negativity and all I'm doing is calling out stupidity because the doom posting is everywhere now. This is the third time someone in this comment section has misconstrued my comments and it's almost a difficulty dealing with this side of the community. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this specific global passive won't make much of a difference in gameplay and people will forget about it in 2 weeks. You can hold me on that, because I'm sure once people see how it doesn't make a huge difference in gameplay, they'll quietly delete and take back their comments on how you ""need"" global passive or your account is cooked."
" @MuB3ta  First of all, you are assuming they are coming back like its the only game they can play. People play games for enjoyment and for others especially on games like gacha, their longevity. This game is mid at best and I am glad I quit this game by 2.8. Maybe not spending anything coz I already learned my lesson in genshin also helped. The influx of new players are not going up, but thinking people will return just because of gacha addiction is just plain stupid. There are games much better than this getting released everyday and this game just continues to go more and more predatory.

P.S: One Global Passive wont matter, but after the Fifth or Sixth Global Passive in the consecutive release mattered as they factor these in when designing endgame would hurt like hell and I am waiting for people who are defending this mechanic get this bit on their ass."
" @megumin9967  I really doubt they're going to make it where you can have multiple global passives at once. And who's to say they won't give older 5 star characters that people already have global passives as well? They could include them into silver wolf or kafka's kit, and continue that trend with other 5 stars as well when they get their respective buff."
I am casual but i think that global passives are a really bad idea
 @Yuki_Ika7  why do you think so
" @megumin9967  if u really wanna quit this game, then stop commenting on this video. you still care about this game if u still care to comment on this topic. people need to realize, this is a gacha game. ofc some characters are gonna be op, but that doesnt mean you need to pull it. what u can critisize is not the character, but the endgame content like the enemy with hp inflation ect. bc thats why the ""needs"" to pull a character is from, when you cant clear the endgame content so you should pull a spesific character. get ur priorities right"
"i played gacha games since fgo jp first week release and still don't understand why people are this upset about global passive in a non pvp gacha game, if there's pvp, fine, but HSR? THE GAME ISN'T EVEN THAT HARD LMAO"
"@wandererman3772  you think I wanna? I hope i'm wrong with this one and not doomposting but this move by hoyo if become successful, will rub off to other gacha games coz you know, HOYO is a placeholder of a successful game via revenue and shareholder perspective. They are the so called golden standard for every gacha game in existence that wants to earn money (Special case for Kuro since all they did was listen). If you think this isn't a gacha space problem then you are in an illusion and deep into addiction thinking Hoyoverse is all it is in the Gacha Space. This move is FOMO XXL."
" @TacticalDimples  the only reason for you to pull new characters in HI3 is if you want to compete in Nirvana, outside of that everything still clears with old characters (old being 4.0+ characters)"
sakura no uta pfp
 @randomboi1959  you must be slow and delusional cause casuals are 100% spending money cause they arent going to sweating to get gems and would rather pay a little to pull. They dont go balls deep but they still send. I know cause my sister is like this.
"​ @MuB3ta imagine thinking you're the smart one for simping for a greedy company and not the players who actually want the, game to improve. Mr.Dookie was right about the greedy and stupid, only it applies to himself and his cult."
"@ buddy talking about illusion while he's in delusion, if u think like that then why no other gacha games following the path of FGO then? its the biggest gacha game before genshin and hsr appeared. at the end of the day, u need to learn what is the core of gacha games, especially with no pvp in the game"
"​ @TacticalDimples global passives on more and more characters = newcomers will be shafted pretty hard tho, ofc assuming that does happen

People like to say it's CC's fault the drama exists to begin with, to some extent I agree they are negatively exaggerating some things, but many complaints are pretty valid, it's just most hoyo players are heavy casuals and they don't really care about a lot of things, as long as they can get and spend for their favorite characters they're gonna greenlight anything that comes their way"
​ @lukebruton4110 u aren't wrong but the ones to complain to is... the regulators
" @amirmahdi9373  So disagreeing with people and not doom posting about hsr = ""simping for a greedy company""?"
"So now it's bad for people who love the game to expect more from a multibillion company ? 
Hsr and genshi were top 1 of all gacha games now none of them can reach that point they aren't even nominee anymore 
Y'all literally fighting for the game dev to just not care about you anymore did y'all see the 3d effects on that game like wtf is this with main mc that get a distorted mouth in some scenes why are you against your game getting better?"
​ @kwhitepearl who do you think hoyo value more a random that pull for some character cause they pretty or the guy that go e6s5 on all his meta character to do massive damage?
​ @MuB3ta think about a new players that get in hsr after 3.2 now his account is ruined until castorice rerun and he now has to fight boss that put you to 1hp and enemies with attack that goes through shield
"@-DA-ONE-  you don't NEED a revive to clear the content. People have been able to do it without a castorice passive until now, so what's the difference?"
"Like to dislike ratio on the livetstream suggests a 80%- rate, but yeah, the majority still doesn't seem to give a fck"
 @MuB3ta  I would agree with you if it weren't  for the new boss that put you to 1 hp and the enemies with attack that goes through shield 💀
"@-DA-ONE-  You clearly don't know what you're talking about. Spend 5 minutes looking at the leaked boss gameplay and come back. The mechanic encourages you to use healers to quickly restore your health back to normal (which is very easy to do if you have gallagher of luocha, who btw is FREE now.)"
" @MuB3ta  It does matter actually as it sets a precedents for other gachas in the future. As well as idk, PEOPLE'S MONEY. People should be outraged. It can certainly ruin people, it's not a joke. It's gambling. Feels bad when you invest money and time on a character, then is powercrept in 2 patches."
"@ammarshamsul1217  how will this affect other people's money? It's a gacha game, no shit everything it does will influence spending. You can't gaslight the majority of people into changing their mind and thinking this is a bad idea now, and especially the devs because they've already made their decision and it's too late to go back. Give the game some time for them to release the character buffs before you cry about your investments and builds being wasted. You people do nothing but talk about ""what-ifs"" instead of just and accepting what the game is now or quitting."
"The majority of people aren't ""outraged"" like you are. This game isn't competitive. There is no pvp. There is no leaderboard, There is no ranked system. Anyone with money can clear all of the content because that's just how gacha games work. They aren't going to release a boss or an endgame stage that requires you to have a guaranteed revive no matter the team setup because that would just be horrible design from a gameplay perspective."
"⁠ @CultureAdd1ct  name me one team comp that needs to revive. sustainless? maybe, but sustainless is built to do enough dmg to not even need a single point of healing, much less a revive. the point is that a global revive isnt needed because it only procs if you either make bad decisions, or youre just not built well. no character needs to be revived, especially if youre running huo2 lingsha and aventurine."
 @arby9930  Exactly. Global passives are more like crutches for new/low investment players or for people who just suck at the game. It's not a necessity. it's just there to make the game easier.
 @arby9930   the fuck does that have to do with anything? lmao
"​ @randomboi1959 Not exactly, they do spend on the game especially since they dont do dailies/events and they only login when theres new story update and new banner. So they need to spend to get the 5*"
​ @Calithilhel Theres also no reason to patronize anyone who have different opinion as hoyoshills. The reason why this whole debat is stupid is because everyone cant have civil discussion without calling name on each other
"@thane451  Yeah it certainly doesn't help how heated people are getting. I understand why though, people who are against the globals feel like this is a near existential issue and they feel like CCs like Pokke don't understand, so they don't know what to do besides lash out harder. In this community especially Pokke has been inconsistent on the issue, maintaining both that globals are bad for the game but it's just a game so it doesn't matter if you pull for fun, he did do a community post today saying he changed his mind today and he'll explain tomorrow on stream though, I wonder how that will go."
" @idontspeakjapanese6289 true, dudes and gals be actually thinking that they’re so important that everyone cares about them quitting a mobile game 😂"
"Yeah myself am just gonna stop playing this game at all, gonna spend my money in Divinity 2 and play that, am quitting gachas"
cautious optimism. good choice imo
"Even OG country they don't care There are a few, but it's still not enough. Watch bilibili livestream"
"i agree, its dumb to just up and quit from this BUT if thinks keep going like this then i could"
" @redvelvetisbetter.1377 not necessarily 

Because let’s be honest, as a whole HSR really doesn’t have much aside from good animation that’s keeping it “ good” but the content and gameplay even by gacha standards has always been mediocre. Theres very little reason to stay if its character devs don’t care"
 @amari7782  its story and so forth is actually much better than most gacha games because most focus on mainly pvp content and most have far fewer animations and fidelity etc as well so it really depends.
"@  and wat exactly are these most gachas cuz I could easily list 10 gachas that have a better story than HSR by a mild and one or 3 of them also have PvP so wat you said is just out right bs 

Star rail really doesn’t have anything that makes it stand out outside of it being a hoyo game

Hell even amongst hoyo games it still gets clapped by zzz and genshin"
 @amari7782  just because you dont like the star rail story and dont think its good doesnt mean it isnt... its so embarrassing how your going off about how awful star rail is when all they said was that they liked the story and gameplay better than others😭
 @blaze1206  tbh quitting gacha games is the best thing you can do. Better to spend your money on actual games atp
" @redvelvetisbetter.1377  except 
1:star rails story and gameplay aren’t good anyone who’s played other turn based games in general let alone gachas can tell you this.

2: my point was wat are these “ most gachas” their reasoning for why star rails story and gameplay are better is simply just wrong because there are gachas like counter side and epic seven that have PvP and still have a better story. A gacha having PvP has nothing to do with them not having good gameplay or story.

The people who always wanna throw other gacha under the bus when it comes to hoyo games never actually know what their talking about because they don’t know any games that fit their own criteria"
 @KnightOfTreachery  or just play gachas that aren’t hoyo games
 @redvelvetisbetter.1377  it’s crazy how you missed the point I was getting at in why what they said is dumb but like every hoyoshill it’s always wat they like not what they said to justify their point
⁠ @amari7782 bro Star Rail’s story has better story telling than Epic Seven .. or Counter Side and I have played both. I am more locked in with HSR and more theorizing future events with them than ES and CS.
how the fuck do you expect only one global passive to work
Or Cas may be the only one with it.
"because if you follow the leaks, then you know that there is  a dedicated tab for global passives while in combat."
​@bunnyx2819 Nah there will be more probably. Although all of them would be more or less on the same level as Castorice's. For me personally it just makes sense. How do you even imagine having smth stupid like 100crit rate as global passive lol
Its not just about how strong the passive is or if it can stack or whatever the problem is that president this sets that hoyo can just lock something as big as a global revive behind gacha and because hoyo is the biggest gacha game company other gacha games will follow suit so all this does is make the gacha space a already predatory space even more predatory
 @radortwyuwu I dont see how that cancels highly likely possibility of a limit. Like if not 1 then at max 3 or smth lol.
 @hellmayor3100  i think it will limited like at best 4 global passive can be use in the battle like Hi3
​ @radortwyuwu All the leaks about Future global passives were Fake. We have to wait for reliable information.
 @shodom-c3h  I dont think HSR is bad because what it does can make other games bad. It's like saying that you cant learn how to cook because then other people will cook too but fail
"My friend, I really appreciate your optimism trust me. 

But you guys really gotta STOP thinking that Hoyoverse is a saint of a company and that they will be considerate with such changes. This is the greediest gacha game company in existance that we're talking about, and time and time again we've seen how their greed is bottomless, please stop believing that will ever change. 

Global passives MIGHT have a limit, and if they do I guarantee you it will atleast stack a few times. Why on earth would they make a whole big box UI for it if it's to fit just one row?? I'm guessing it will be limited to 4 global passives active at once, but regardless the game is beyond cooked."
" @JokerOfCards   we can't do anything btw, and i never expect this game getting slower, as a 7 years Hi3 player i already get used to this shit"
"It's really not impossible that they will add a broken passives, now look at silverwolf bro before, she's literally broken because she can implant weakness now look what we have, anaxa, can implant all weakness and Aoe too💀"
" @radortwyuwu  um no there isn't that im aware of at all, Ive watched leaks and there's nothing about that from any reliable leaker or any at all or the dataminers.."
 @radortwyuwu  you should probably go back and read the leaks properly becuase no that was wrong that UI thing wasn't for global buffs its not even showing castorices or anything of the sort.. the UI change that came just shows castorices global passive and that's it.. the rest are entirely false..
​ @tempestu2676 but does he reduce resistances? No. So you'll still be basing your head against 40% ice res. Tell me you don't know in game mechanics
 @yulfine1688  Huh? If the UI wasn't for Global Passives then why is Castorice's passive written there? Just for fun? 🤣🤣 You are contradicting yourself.
 @hellmayor3100  Having a limit does not make it any better. The point is that they can lock stupid shit behind limited 5 stars.
" @radortwyuwu  It wasn't its not even her global passive icon, the element was added so people could more easily see her passive being active.
No data leaker has mentioned anything about any other unit or global passives any leak you've seen claiming phainon or hyacine or cerdyra have a global passive is currently false until dataminers tell us otherwise.

The same is said for cipher we already know her kit anyways."
 @yulfine1688  at this point I'm not even sure if we're talking about the same thing. There IS a screenshot ingame of the ui/box for her global passive. Look it up on the subreddit. The UI is indeed for global passive/s.
"​ @radortwyuwu that is what i looked up and no it wasn't for global passives that was a month ago and people were freaking out with the screenshot.

And then everyone moved on because it was just to show castorices passive to be active... it was literally in the patch notes... 

There's also 0 evidence of any other global passives currently for any further characters until hoyo or dataminers confirm it because even dataminers said it wasnt a ui for global passives."
​ @shodom-c3h  you mean exactly like edilons? It's not a new precedent the game isn't catered to e6s5 combat
"THERE NO GAMEPLAY IN HSR 
so it's 
WHERE'S ENDGAME"
mess
Global
Overreaction
Mid
2 global passives per month for the funny. Just get it over with lol

I’m so sick of people defending this because it not that op
"Star Rail being a turned based combat is what turned me off the game. Never touching it ever. For all of Genshin's flaws, it will always be the more enjoyable game for me. (Wuwa is great too)"
"There's one ""band-aid"" for this situation, it is by no means a fix, however. 

Hoyo should give every player a free Castorice, so everyone has the global passive on their account. They should just take the L and consider global passives a failed experiment and never make another character with a one ever again and they seriously need to find a way to slow down or eliminate this hp inflation that keeps getting worse with every patch."
I only pulled for the dragon 😅
this is why they just announced a new honkai game. Star Rail is doomed.
Pulled because JP va is Tamamo... still quit the game.
"acheron is like gojo. their mere presence changed the balance of the entire world, making stronger enemies and other future characters stronger hahahaha"
XD she is so strong you do not even have to use her
"Coming back to this after Castorices Banner is almost over, I haven’t seen the passive in action once."
bro... i miss our four stars 😭 i don't think we've deadass had a new four star in 10 months...
"Wow. I heard about the drama, but I thought it already died, I totally forgot about it. But this video is the proof od how vocal minority think they are majority and how they are easily manipulated by videos and propagandas made to scare them. The real problem, that actually exist, is ignored. Heavy powercreep and meta enforcement to clear even the story content. But when something insignificant like this is happening, morons in the community make it as it was the big threat. Same kind of drama was created when Arlecchino got her weapon. Idiots there also were scaring everyone that THIS BAD and other crap. Like YOU DON'T HAVE TO OWN IT. And now people are literally saying cringe stuff like they will hate Castorice, justifying toxicity and they think it's fine? The global passive changes LITERALLY nothing. It's just another reason to decide if you want character or not. But that's nothing else. It's not something that will actually change anything. If I didn't want to get Castorice since 3.0, I wouldn't, and definitely such a minor passive effect wouldn't convince me. And people saying ""it's a new quality of character"". That's so dramatic and full of lies. Like it's like saying Archons in Genshin should be 6 stars. They are clearly superior, especially with Furina being able to walk on water and stuff. People didn't believe Furina would be able to walk on water, because it's ""too OP"", before it was even announced. Now nobody makes a big deal about it. Because there are no propagandists who say this is a threat and a bad thing. But people tried to scare people with how bad Arlecchino's signature is. Like somehow having a skin for character is okay, but if weapon is cool when you use it with character is a scam. Same mentality there and here. Scaring people for something that doesn't even matter at all. On top of that, group of people think they represent everyone. Most people don't care and aren't such incels. Gacha community is so dumb and toxic. They enforce their own stupidity on others and think they are absolute right, especially when thy are absolute wrong, like in this case. Stop spreading negativity, misinformation and toxicity. All of you. Why were you ignoring powercreep for 2 years, but when one character gets global passive that is more like a bonus, it's suddenly bad thing? Why do I even say this... obviously it's like talking to antivaxxers. They always know better than actual professionals..."
"I have noticed that since the hp meta came back with Tribbie enemies seem to do more damage than before. My Acheron would definitely not be able to survive if I didn't have Aveturine. 
I mean think about how much health Tribbie has, and think of Tingyun and the memes about her dying all the time. You're going to be Tingyun without Castorice or HP units overall."
"Got E6S1 Castorice in 296 pulls
Got real lucky"
"I only log onto HSR when there are free pulls to be claimed as I like the characters and trailers and discussing said characters with friends who do actively play the game, but the world/gameplay/story/combat is extremely boring/skippable so I rarely ever play HSR. Just wanted to say that Castorice design wise is fantastic. I could care less about any of her abilities or whatever this drama is. She's just a great design and so I pulled for her cause she looks amazing. Castorice, Jingliu, Lingsha, Sparkle, Xueyi, Firefly <3"
"As someone who wanted Castorice so badly before her kit was even released purely for the design, i am really sad to see that she is ruined by the greedy devs of the game and some players have even started to hate on her 💔"
I could see certain endgame modes that disable global passives.
Ngl I wish to see vars playing limbus and starts to make videos about it
Who's guaranteeing that they're going to add more global passives to the game?????
I pulled for Castorice because I though she was cool... But once I found out that she's been tied to global passive and the fact that my character doesn't die... That's actually wild. I don't know how to feel about it- it kinda feels illegal for something like that to even happen 💀
"Top up services are always a risky bet. Wouldn’t recommend taking more sponsors from them in the future, the only person I know that has tried using a “trusted” one they used a creator code with ended up getting their Genshin account banned a month or so later. They hadn’t used mods, cheats, private servers, or done any account sharing. Use at your own risk."
These sites always seam so tempting for the cheaper top ups but at the same time they look so risky in so many ways.
Will they also give the same bonuses that the game gives when buying?
​ @jensei9870 i actually got the double
And who's guaranteeing that they're not gonna?
"From what I’ve heard about Honkai Impact, global passives aren’t “unprecedented.” Apparently HI3 has them as well and they aren’t substantial in the least."
"7:02 LMAO as F2P as possible? Genshin? It's one of the most stingy Gacha by far, Honkai is better on that point but still nowhere near the most generous and F2P gacha. 
Uma Musume is 10 time more generous and F2P than any Hoyoverse gacha, same thing for the EOS since 2023 or 2024 Revived Witch, same thing for PGR, Tower of Fantasy, i don't play it but a friend i know do play Wuthering Wave and it's way better too, i could continue to quote Gacha that are way more generous and F2P than Hoyoverse gacha. 
It's not because worst gacha exist (not that much for Genshin it's really on the list for the worst money grab scumbag gacha) like Dokkan for example that we can excuse Hoyoverse, Star Rail is at the middle of the ladder at best from the ""F2P friendly"" point of view mainly because of how stupid the power crept and frequency of release, not even speaking about the scumbag mechanic of Eidolons.
So no Hoyoverse doesn't make the effort to make it as F2P as possible, like i said i have tons of example of gacha, who exist since multiple year, that prove that Hoyoverse could be way more generous than this and still be fine."
Where is the music in the end from :0
"I've seen other people mention this, but the real danger of power creep is that it is alienating. It will push away returning players, and possibly will result in less new players as well. Of course these aren't issues if the majority of existing players stay and keep spending, but once the exodus starts it's gonna be ugly."
"I have no issue with it, not like I’m playing other users online, just cpu."
"If Hoyo continues with making global passives, I honestly think that letting an account have only one active at a time (which the player can select at any time out of combat)  is the only way to not break the game..."
"The worst part is the community told them from the very begining of the character beta and they just ignored it all, it shows they don't really listen to feedback"
"Castorice passive aint even that good, those who could do sustainless would do it even without her and those who cant do sustainless wount do even if they have her. Not to mention that endgame isnt that hard, people just either refuse to farm relics or cant read as happened with Nikador"
"Good to be me because I've never really cared about end game content and do that to minimum just because im lazy for something like that. I do main story, events, pull for characters i like and enjoy it. Maybe it's just people who needs to chill out a bit. Its still the small part of community who's angry about that, because hsr is now top 1 in some Chinese games chart which means that if not you, then millions of other people will keep the game alive. They already had such anniversary spending event in hi3 and no one really cared, but in hsr it's suddenly a problem, idk. Sometimes i feel like people making hsr drama just for drama. People hated on Acheron for her new animations and dmg, people are hating on castorice for her animations and dmg, people gonna hate on next year anv character for their animations and dmg, nothing new"
"They really poison pilled this issue by burying it in 1) a highly anticipated character and 2) anniversary too-up resets, and I’m hella resentful. It’s ridiculous to see how they weaponize certain characters like Castorice while leaving others nothing (Anaxa), and tbh if I wasn’t looking forward to my boy Phainon I’d have very little to hold on for at the moment, Elysia be damned. Surely they have to know how much people (at least in the west) don’t like this pay for power stuff right? But that assumes they care at all about their reputation in the west lmao 🤡"
"am I the only one who thinks while it does set a ominus sign of passives to come, Castorice seems to be overhated since she does lend herself to a unique playstyle and lets be real here she is firefly levels of f2p literaly all u need is a pela and gahlager wich they have apeared in numerous banners and the remembrance tb they even gave us a lc to build with. the passive is not that great since skill issue but when my units die and resurect they get hit again so bascily if u reach a point ur character dies and needs to revive then u need to restart that run most of the time.

the question we should really ask is when new 4 star we need that remebrance 4 star for castorice and aglea."
"Lol imagine caring how a casual, single player, mobile game does. Just don't pay, don't play or don't pull on the character. 
I just don't care, I pulled Algaea, Mydei and his LC and now Cast and her LC. 
I find it funny when people who have no experience in business, especially mobile gaming, decides what's good or bad as if they have yhe analytical data. 
The release schedule is only an issue if you're an entitled or greedy player, I have issues skipping cringe united like Tribbie, Yunli and HouHou. 
Stop acting like the game is hard, I purposely run bad team and still clear MOC/AS/PF with full stars. 
The only issues with the game are bad writing, no skip button and no hard content. Also, I'm a low spender, literally just pay if I don't win my 50/50 or 75/25, no more, no less so I'm by no means a whale nor do I go for dupes."
"I can’t believe there are so many players actually praising this company, acting like nothing‘s wrong, and some believing this is the best thing that they’ve ever done, and are so oblivious to the noticeably growing fact that this company is literally preying on them, with no respect for players time and efforts."
My problem is why couldn’t they add a standard 5 star remembrance as well? Also why can’t we get any 4 star remembrance cuz Hyacine looks like a 4 star imo
"everytime I see this argument I bring up the following remember when Acheron released and she is able to kill overworld enemies and everyone basically said the same that is is broken and they can now just remove all overworld enemies because all characters will have that now and in the end in was just her the anniversary character, maybe just maybe it is the same effect here that because Cas is the anniversary character she has a unique skill.

I am not saying it might not happen but all I am saying maybe don't throw the baby out with the bathwater just yet, people are too quick to judge when something similar happened a previous time and nothing else came of it, it was unique to only ever 1 character."
you should be friends with tectone.
No bro video is a mistake casto passives cant revive anyone unless they receive heal or shield!!! So you need always a sustain in your team she is not opening the fourth slot lol
omg is it like having a virus on your account?
Lmao majority of the players don't really care. Y'all the loud minority here
"Or worse imagine a global passive that's only enabled when you E2 a character or something. 
Let's just hope they keep it an anniversary thing so you can at least plan for it"
they do listen do feedback but only Chinese. Maybe Chinese players don't care?
it's not about the passive itself but rather the precedent that it sets. I am tired of beholding people repeat the same over and over again. It was never about her passive specifically
"@adriantepes4355  bruh, did you even watch the video? The CC talks how ""Strong"" the passive is, i know people are complaining about the future potential, but thats not whas video was talking about"
her damage is exceptionally high which yet again leads to HP bloating
those f2p losing 50/50 are either gonna suck it up or spread their wallets for the first time
"Man, if the hoyo increase jade per patch and makes LC 100% guaranteed

I might forgive them lol"
"I'm glad you mentioned the game being centered around the global passive. hoyoshills are REFUSING to admit this. if it is brought up, hoyoshills ignore that. THIS WILL HAPPEN!! It's ALREADY centering bullshit around new characters in Genshin (nightsoul bullshit). The newer weekly bosses are so inflated, too! It already seemed to be pushing Castorice ahead of time back with Harmonious Choir. That boss did MASSIVE damage. And Feixiao does even more."
"Just look at GBF. All of the archanegels there are must-pulls, no questions asked, there is no room for experimentation."
The bitrate whenever Castorice uses her dragon is hilarious 😭
If they keep it to just anni units I really don't mind global passives as a concept since those units usually get special privileges anyways. We'll see if it stays that way
"Imagine crying because of a character, grow up. Its a video game you sooks"
"I have always afraid of turned based RPG because the reliance on the stats and skills available on the characters can easily powercrepts other characters. in theory, everyone MUST pull this character. they will make enemies tha forced you to use this characters. I do not like that kind of development"
We have leaks for several characters already. None have a global passive.
I was wondering why everyone was freaking out about her
"Let me shed some light for the cute lil' brains of those whose so called a player who cares for their favorite game. 

Logically speaking, in turn-based games, the difficulty is the selling point.

So let’s break it down to two core points about turn-based gacha games:

1. Selling characters with simple mechanics? → What’s mainly being sold here is influence and story engagement. But as we all know, Hoyoverse has trash-tier writing, only saved by solid execution.

2. Selling mechanics and must-pull characters every patch? Obviously.

There are only two target markets: hardcore players, whales, simps — or casual players who, in general, don’t really contribute much to the game's revenue.

Hoyoverse, as a dev committed to its games (not players), still needs big funding—especially after breaking off from Tencent.

And you heard they’re cooking up another Honkai title, right? That one’s running on UE4/5.

This isn’t about balancing or “caring for the players.”
It’s about server sustainability.

No point in catering to F2P or low-mid spenders if true whales — especially from mainland — just want their waifus to exist as they imagine. Sacrificing whales means Hoyo runs at a deficit. Simple.

What comes next?
Stagnation.

It’s clear Hoyo wants to keep their game alive, but they’re stuck in a player dilemma — just look at how many revisions the Casto kit went through. That speaks volumes.

No need to compare with stuff like Wuwa (which is open-world) or FGO — that’s a different story. FGO’s surviving off player loyalty, and its whales are consistent. That’s why it stays at the top of income charts.

Hoyo’s playerbase? Mostly just casuals looking for a stress reliever. They don’t spend much, and that’s why Hoyo’s in a pinch.

Why do I keep bringing up whales?
Because without whales, the company dies. Period.

And don’t think breaking from Tencent means they’re on good terms.

If we’re talking domino effect…

There’s no way your shiny new waifu/husbando won’t get GP. Characters that are clearly designed to be hyped will always be given that treatment. At least 20% of new installs are banking on those characters getting GP — that’s just how it is.

That’s the basic logic.

Most people only think about how GP affects casuals and new players.

But if you’re the type who rolls for every fav char every patch, you should already understand the consequences. So why blame the corp? They’re just tailoring characters based on current market demands.

And what does the market want now?

Waifu/husbu wars. Meta flexing. Character supremacy.

So no, Hoyo isn’t wrong for releasing GP.

At the end of the day, they’re just giving players what they’ve been asking for this whole time:

“Ugh, this game’s too easy.”

“Bro where’s the challenge??”

“My waifu better be meta, dude.”


People complained the game was too easy — so they dropped GP. Now everyone’s whining? This is the result of players' own actions."
"3.5 global passive ""dots can crit"""
">be me
>barely played this game
>log in and see I have a ton of unclaimed rewards and freebies
>decide to use some of them on the cute purple elf banner

Feels good man."
It's really harder with the chronicle wishes because this Character I really want cuz when she  hurts I had a Chronicles going on there's a character that I wanted and I kept pulling for her but I don't know how many pity it takes to guarantee them and I wanted her for so long but I'm scared for I don't know if she'll be good for the metal I can't unlock her materials
Heya Vars love your videos but I have to ask when is my girl Rappa getting her own Video 🎉❤
I feel so bad for pulling the new character because well I needed  more  of my account and she has been so helpful but I agree with every single point that you made that as a free to play player trying to keep up the meta is very very very very very very very very very very impossible to keep up and because I spend a lot of time away from the game because I started on the game came out but I stopped playing it until like a few months ago so it's hard to save up enough wishes to guarantee a character like I had to get her after skipping two badges of really good characters I like the deals in the amount of pools you get in getting enough to do it because I can't unlock everything at the same time have been so helpful and I'm kind of afraid of what will happen if I didn't have her😢😢
Power creep has always been an issue in gacha games. But is this really all that bad?
maan i wana quit but that fate collab thou
"2023 we have Curios
2024 we got DU Equations
2025 we got Global Passive
2026 we get Unit that gives out +1 eidolon level to all your characters"
"I don't even play star rail, I just watch these videos because listening to Vars talking about literally anything is strangely calming."
"I also don't think that her passive is as impactful as people are insinuating. Non sustain is already something that's done, you're just getting one extra mistake"
"Two characters, and they probably aren't going to be well-selling ones. I predict new global passive at the next anniversary character. Even a few global passives is bad."
"western ccs are so cringy, one hivemind of whiny dramafarmer"
"There's the release of a unit in Arknights, drama lasted less than 1 month after global, and everyone moved on, but power difference between her and the previous supreme units is as much as creatine to anabolic steriods, Not. Even. Close.

- Near-global range

- Boss-killing main damage even though carrying only 6 ammo.

- Absurd splash damage

- Triple sprites that tank what YOUR toughest tanks could not

- Camoflauge for extreme survivability (except some AoE attacks)

- Cheap deployment price

- Quick charge cycle for that nasty skill 3

And yet she's now verified as a NOT must-have for whatever reasons that the community accepted their games' powecrept fate, moving on, I hope HSR's community gathers the will to forgive Hoyo's repeat offenses, wallowing is not worth it :("
"If I quit genshin for 3  patches long, I can still clear full stars on endgame content.


That's hard to say for HSR."
"its not that castorice global passive is OP, but rather its setting a new standard and in the future, more and more global passive will come around and perhaps. it will be a game changer"
"Thank god I decided to not play this game, become power creep shit show 2 years is crazy from dev this size and experience."
"I like Castorice as a character.  I actually really like her. But not gonna pull her. Mostly because I'd like to focus on my Therta team, Acheron team, and FuA team."
"Coming to a video like this, or the many videos that were out during the leak period so no one could look up anything Castorice related without being spoiled by her kit... I see so much disdain, anger, absolute hate for the passive in the comments. Praise for the CCs ""speaking out"" about it... and yet so many of those very same CCs still pulled for Castorice. And even those that didn't still tested her / made guides after talking ad nauseum about the dangerous precedent and how it would kill the game for them/others. And then, the vast majority of players simply do not care or do not see it that way, and happily got their Castorice, as seen in the comments of literally any other recent HSR video/hoyolab/twitter/etc. They did not care to change Mydei who literally becomes an auto unit after you spend thousands for his E6. It's their game, it's PvE, idk why people are acting like it's weird or that they aren't allowed to do stuff in their game, even if it upsets us. It's not the first nor the last time. Everyone needs to actually decide if this will be that pivotal moment that dictates whether they officially quit or if they will continue to play.

From an actual design perspective, it's actually incredibly cool. It's honestly a shame people hate it, but from the looks of it, once they have a design path in mind, they don't seem to deviate from it at all."
"i can't wait for her to eventually get powercrept like the other shilled ""waifu"" in this game"
"in regards to the hp inflation like i'm a spender & have pulled for all but 3 or 4 characters & have lcs and e1's on some, but i still can't beat moc 12 currently"
Now all we need is a heal global passive… that’s cooked
Her passive nerfed her eidolons so bad shes good at e0 but at e6 its straight up the worst compared to other e6 like therta mydei or aglea.
Memokeeper of rememberance? Cas isnt a memokeeper
"As someone who has spend money this patch and will be spending more, but hasn’t pulled since Tribbie, I must say I’ve passed the point of caring. I want anaxa and preferably as many copies as I can get, while staying below 300€. I was disappointed by how much love casto got compared to him, but as a Jingliu main, I’m used to seeing my fav rot in a corner. End game clear is only possible to a certain point and I liked amphoreus a lot, I don’t play to clear anymore. I come and go however I please,mostly when there’s a character I want. They can do whatever they want, they will do whatever they want, but they ain’t getting a single cent after anaxa is gone"
Are you going to talk about the complete lack of content in the game or is that not farming enough views.
I left for 2 months and only returned for anniversary rewards...if I get Anaxa(?) in the second half though I'll probably actually return to playing again and drop ZZZ because that man is BEAUTIFUL
"She got SOOOOOO much promotion, plot this chapter, unique mechanics, animation, extra media, and support characters. She absolutely did not need the global passive

I can see global passives maybe giving design space if they turn into a *slot*, like you get a single buff active on your account, and then QoL bonuses from them (such as increased Basic Attack multipliers, EHR boosting DoT and Entanglement damage, or boosting 4-star character damage) so rich don't get richer, but gosh oof I doubt they'd make it healthy like that"
"The story refused to let a majority of characters who die stay dead, and now its part of gameplay now too. Yay.
I already disliked Castorice as a character, she didn't appeal to me and I had to spend far too much time with her. I tolerate her a lot more now with all the story about her, but at first she was incredibly underwhelming and annoying for me. Now here's her global passive (which i'd liked to propose shortening to GBP because i think it'd be hilarious) setting a dangerous precedent. It'd be fine if it was just her team, accountwide is appalling."
"I disagree, even if they don't do it ever again it's still bad. Castorice could have wen live like this in an acceptable way only if it was a character reward for everyone who completes the amphoreus story and in no other way. A 6 star unit is just unacceptable. The only ""good"" thing they can do is backtrack and make her so that you need her in team. Any other option is just us eating shit willingly."
"This game is going to the dump fast. Not fun, predatory, and annoying

Edit: i find it hard to believe they are trying to make the game f2p friendly. If that was the truth the endgame content wouldn’t feel so impossible unless you have multiple premium teams"
Me who pulled Castorice 3 times in one pull. I can't die im [INVINCIBLE]
Have you seen Chinese and Korean gacha fans? Lol
How's that Weiner lil bro?
"Man, and here I thought the whiners would STFU once the patch was out but nope, gotta farm those clicks XD"
1:36 why do those thumbnails look ai generated lmao
I love playing hsr but I just wish the devs listen to its players there's so much going on with this game to point where I'm slowly losing interest in play at at all and this coming from a F2p
first paywall rider in genshin and now paywall healer in hsr?
"Good video, but zero-sustain is NOT new"
"In the future powercreep more crazy like march 7th emanator remembrance, Phainon night and day mechanic.... everyone gonna adapt anyway like honkai impact 3 -enigmata??"
Wait till they add a character that has Global Def shred passive.
"I'm going to say this: Global passive is a new mechanic and of course placing it on the newest anniversary unit is something that should be acceptable. My greatest example is Dokkan Battle where the anni or WWDC units introduce a new mechanic get the new 1st monotype leader buffs, 2nd anni 120% 2nd WWDC category leader passives  Leader passives mechanics 3rd anni transformations, 4th anni active skills, 5th anni new leader skills, 6th anni revives, 7th anni intro skills 8th anni stand-by skills, 8th WWDC field buffs, 9th anni taunt skills 10th anni swapping unit feature. 

All of the new units and even F2P or standard banner units got one of these mechanics. People are getting angry for a new mechanic which will comeback with more f2p friendly units. 

Is it affecting power creep? Absolutely, power creep cannot be evaded, however Honkai has this problem since it's 1st anni and it should be addressed. Like Acheron literally has a different ult mechanic and passive structure where you have to run Nihility units to make her dps stronger. We might get a unit f2p or 4 star options and we'll have some good buffs. In my opinion we should get more f2p friendly 4 stars since we only got Moze as a 4 star and he's ain't even f2p since he works with FUA and some people don't have Dr. Ratio because it was a limited time event.

Overall I can understand why people are mad and, but it's a basic gacha game feature that has happened and is still happening to this day. Honkai lacks a good f2p roster and that we can all agree and I feel like we should get buffs also buffs for Dan Heng, Natasha and Asta. Global passives will be accessible and I'm positive about it.

I can understand that a revive mechanic is insanely broken and Bailu has it only for 1 unit and she ain't the best healer, but it's an anni unit of course she'll be top tier. Again Dokkan is an good example where most of the time the major celebration units were considered as the best units in the game and are the most of the time the top grossing, same with Saiyan day, Tanabata, WWDC, Golden week, Goku day etc."
"Eh, I used my guaranteed for Cas and I haven’t changed the way how I play the game. I play it the same as I did before having her."
"HSR needs more reruns, less 5* releases and more 4*"
People being surprise about a gacha game being a gacha game
I been saying for a long time that this isn't going to be a problem. They're limit testing. They will never add flat damage buffs to global passives because that's bad for business.
"Honestly, I wish we had more than two buttons, as well as a slower release time of characters"
"I guess the original purpose of the global passive is to make units that could be easily powercrept to have some value even when they are no longer meta. Which is good at first glance, but this creates more problems. 

Firstly, this exposes the fact that the devs have no plans on buffing dps units since they still have some value when not being deployed. 

Secondly, this kills the whole purpose of teambuilding, if the effect lasts even when the units not on the field players will lose incentive to use other characters creatively or strstegically"
so glad i quit this game early
The game is already unfriendly to new comer idk why people think it gotten worst when were already there since the end of penacony
"I hate it sm. I liked Castorice initially, but this blatant favoritism and tasteless fanservis made me sick."
"People already wanted Castorice before the GP so Hoyo got away with it
People are also hyped about the Fate collab so Hoyo can get away with it again. That would be the biggest FOMO ever since they most likely won't have a rerun"
"Sorry but you can't go sustainless using Castorice, you'll get 1 more turn and then die"
"I've been bored with the game since leaving belabog and the only reason I kept playing was in hopes of them going back to flashing out their story.

This might as well be the best time to quit."
Cause they are (for the Hoyo ones)
"First , thanks for the video 
Second , normally i don't comment and content with just like but i really want to say it : i don't if it intentioal or not , but for some reason whenever i search for people say negative things about version 3.2 , results are always people happy about version 3.2 as if iam forced to watch these videos instead 
So i wanted to ask , am i the only one that happened to me or not?
note : i don't believe in conspiracy , but these results always happen to me 
Sorry for my bad English"
"As a casual player, I personally don't see the problem with Castorice. I play the game and obtain characters based on how I like them (design, playstyle, and personality-wise) so I don't really care how much broken or trash they are."
"I have the battlepass and monthly pass and I can still barely keep up with the MOC. Have been consistently clearing MOC12 until the latest patch, where even a well built EOSO Castorice and a well built EOS1 Feixiao couldn't even clear it"
It's quite unfortunate.  I used to really like this game but it's very obvious the devs stopped caring about the players and don't have any intentions of fixing things.  This game fell to greed a lot faster than I thought.  It makes me wonder how quickly ZZZ will fall to it
Got my c1 castorice
"My personal reason of which I think Castorice's global passive isn't a good idea is because it simply has no cost. The cost to using any other character's ability is rooted in them taking up a party slot, a universal cost for every chraracter so far. Castroice goes and breaks that by having an ability which holds infinite value because of the passive having no cost associated with using it. Given how they've implimented the global UI, I do also agree that they're more than likely to add more global passives, and that'd have the same issue as Castorice's global where there is no cost associated. The only way I can personally see them balancing a system like this is making it so that only a set number of globals can be active at once, as well as possibly providing some free global passives, because at that point globals will probably function similarly to lightcones: things that augment or add onto your team's playstyle."
"Honestly the FSN collab is one of the only things that keep me in this game, i have been skipping the whole Amphoreus for it, so you can see what i really value the most.
It's just sad that the powercreep is so strong in the game, it's hard to have fun when endgame tries so hard to shove characters that you don't want down your throat"
"Unpopular opinion: F2Ps should not be able to full clear end game unless they're the ""sweaty"" type.

Last I checked, MHY isn't an NPO, and AFAIK there's no evidence yet that they're selling players personal data for profit. So they benefit almost zero from allowing F2Ps to be able to full clear end game.

I'd even argue that allowing general F2Ps to be able to full clear end game would even hurt the game's long-term health, as a few vocal F2Ps will definitely start shitposting spenders all over the place for ""not being smart and spent money on this game which you could have cleared without spending at all""."
HSR now feels like a generic cash grab mobile game like diablo immortal or raid shadow legends
God forbid a company catch a vibe
in thier defnse castorice is the Chrysos Heir of death. so her global passive makes sense
"I'm not a HSR player so I can say this as someone standing on the sidelines. Making a character have a global passive that takes affect even if they aren't in the party is UNACCEPTABLE. If she had that effect if she was in the party then it'd be *fine*, it still sounds kinda busted but it's *fine*. But it being global? For everyone? Forever? That is not okay. Even if her buff was something insanely tiny like +10 atk globally, it still wouldn't be okay."
"In practice the global passive isn't quite as earthshattering as some people have tried to make it out to be. Not you, Vars; this was a great breakdown.

Having used it to push my limits in MoC I can say it is SUPER easy to basically get no value out of it. It doesn't clear status effects, so if you get a DoT slapped on the revived character they die immediately before getting to exploit the passive.

Honestly, the best use for it is hoping a super slow character that provides an 'off field' effect is the one that gets revived due to how much value you'd still retain until you hit that heal/shield or die check. Jade with the Poet's set is probably the best at the moment."
"Man, I'm really getting high on copium and hoping that Castorice is just a special snowflake and not a setting for a new standard."
"i got castorice because i like her character and kit, i would love if they change her passive to no longer be global because i truly dont want it to be, im going to continue building and playing other teams as if i didnt have the global if i can avoid it, i might take use of it occasionally but overall im going to try not to"
she power creeped even the log in animations 😭
Lmao imagine loving Elysia
"I have a version 0 acc that I’ve been playing pretty much daily ever since. It is impossible to keep up with content these days. The power creep is too fast, there aren’t enough jades to pull with, the content gives so little for how much time it eats out of my day… it’s difficult to be a low spender in this economy lmao and as strong as castorice is, I’m saving for Anaxa bc I already pulled for Huohuo and I’m on guaranteed pity rn (unless, of course, I suddenly triple the amount of pulls I have, which is unlikely, bc I don’t have the money to be whaling for anyone). I’m still using Serval as my lightning dps. And Seele as my quantum dps. Life is hard."
Curious about Kafka and Blade buff... if it's pathetic that is when I uninstall. Should be atleast 70% Castorice Aglea level
"I am f2p since the start of the game once i could 3 star all of the endgame I could do it all the time even with the health inflation it's just that bad floors would take 5-4 cycles instead of 1-3.
 most of the people with vaild concernes about what this might lead and what does it set are vaild,
 but people sayin ""I can't 0-cycle anymore the powercreap is the problem"" or tiktok teams whit 20% crit rate and 75% crit damage would tell you the game is dying are the ones bloating the issue and doomposting"
"That is not exactly ""casual""."
"bro I started playing in 1.6 (almost f2p), I've never cleared MOC 12 still 😂 However I can complete pure fiction and apocalyptic shadow with 12 stars"
I guess MOC 12 will forever be  impossible for me to 3 star at this point
"I mean i agree with you, it's just that even that doesn't cut it sometimes, the HP of the enemies sometimes are so huge that even a top 5% older character will struggle or fail to complete the content that a mid new character can"
" @HachannEinzbern  they had to push you into pulling new characters because that's the only way of garanteeing continuous revenue. It's not a ""high-social"" game so selling skins just won't cut it."
" @cym104  Actually making the characters more likeable also helps with sales, Fgo had huge revenues for years even though the metagame could be mostly ignored"
"Ya Casotirce sets a bad precedent 100 percent. However I think you are way over hyping how good Casotrices passive is. A revive at 1 hp, still requires you to have some sort of heal. Then the character dies if not healed within 1 turn. It's really not that good. Global passives bad, Castorices global passive not really good either"
Genshin: (subtly look at their Characters who already have Global Passives since 2.X)
"idk, i am not as concerned as everyone else. i could very well imagine that it was a one time gimmick since castorice has such a special place in the world. to me it's 100% comparable to acheron, and her technique. the timing was the same and so is the type of charachter they both are in terms of both story role and fandom hype. 
i also feel like it does not make a bigger change to your account and the game than other characters, especially supports, we had. which make the game just straight up x times harder if you don't have them. like ruan mei, robin, now sunday (i think?) and tribbie.
so yeah idk. i'd say... chill?
tbh, regarding the overall problems, it would help if ppl could keep their wallets shut instead of going down the pay path as soon as they can't max star a content :)"
"Grow up, I bet you they are not gonna drop another global passive even befor the drama, I BET YOU"
Global passives exist in honkai impact. This is not the first time they have done this.
"Now I'm worried that their way of ""buffing"" older units is by giving them global passives. Not necessarily making them better in battle, but by making them more valuable to have in the account, and incentivizing people to pull them on their reruns."
at the end of the day if the game still makes money in the long run then it will prove to be the right decision ( for them ). it means they knew their market and it worked. because i would like to believe that hyv just like any other tech company is making data-driven decisions. so we'll know in time.
"Hypothetical: if and only if they balance the game around the experience of relatively new players, then global passives can be beneficial for the long-term health of the game. It will still be largely FOMO-driven and risky to say the least, but ultimately if new players are able to clear without them, then their experience will be quite fine. Players who would already have multiple global passives, on the other hand, wouldn't need to feel too pressured to pull for too many new units since they would be getting buffs from their entire character roster, making it easier for their older units to clear new content regardless.

Would this be better than just reducing powercreep? Probably not.

Will they actually go this route? I wouldn't bet on it."
"I mean, they still have a lot, but they are a percent of the player base, it doesn't surprise me they want to squeeze the ones they have before they lose many more. But seriously, as a fan of MiHoyo, I hope they fix StarRail, the gameplay, the story, the characters, ZZZ did little tweaks in story and characters once released why HSR can't?"
"Let me play the world’s smallest violin 🎻 

Seriously who actual cares. I been playing games for about 30 years so I understand the frustration and passion, but ultimately it’s just a game. IMO, I actually like her passive and she’s cool. If people don’t like it, then don’t get her or just stop playing the game. It’s that easy."
cant wait for kuro games turn based rpg ngl
"I get the main point of this video being ""Global passives stuck to limited units is bad to this game"", and yes I do agree. But honestly for Castorice's case her passive really isnt that broken- It just saves you from resetting and is just more or less quality of life"
i love spamming the <10 seconds on the start of the vid so i can hear vars  say honk honk honk
I pulled cause she has scythe. Im a dimple dude
"Didn't you see all that p2w trash they added this version?
HSR IS going down THAT path..."
"I pulled Castorice and was going to pull her anyway. I just really liked her design and personality, and it sucks that shes in such controversy because of 1 stupid decision that the devs made. There are so many ways they could fix the global passives. For example, only anniversary units have them, so they come out once every year or so. They could only affect anything except dmg. They could also just make them unusable in MOC,AS, and PF. Let's just hope that whereever they are going its not toward their grave."
"Hopefully they do something like being able to only have one global passive at a time, otherwise this game is COOKED"
"i'm... kinda glad i quit the game a long time ago. the main reason was that i couldnt go full time on both games focusing on both stories at the same time, but im glad i did when i did coz i didnt have to experience the whole powercreep express"
"F4ck all people that reported Wuwa, just play your $hity games and leave us alone!"
5:25 since when was castorice a memokeeper of remembrance kek
"I disagree on one particular Point: 

""This doesnt mean the Game is ruined""

No, it does. I know i am doomposting Here, but lets be real for Just a second. When acheron came Out with her weakness ignore mechanic, what happened then? More and more characters came Out, doing it even more(firefly, feixiao). And now? We are Just talking about castorice, she isnt an emenator. Anyone spending Money Düring and after castorice incident, to me, might as Well Take a gun and shoot their own foot."
Glad I quitted then. Fuck dis shit I'm out.
"The passive itself is so-so. I initially thought it was worthless because I thought the unit will die again if they aren't healed before their next action. It seems like they do actually get a full turn first tho which can make it useful for sustainless 0-1 cycles. But you are 100% right it's the precedent being set that is the major worry for players, and rightfully so. Almost equally scummy is the extreme whale festival they're holding with the anniversary. An event based on how much you top up is disgusting and there's no other way to interpret it. The character shop is another one that is 100% catered to whales. I did actually get one silver companion spirit upon logging in because I have E7 Bronya as a $5/mo player, but I think I'm in the extreme minority there. I did pull Castorice because I need a modern DPS, but over all I'm not happy about this anniversary."
"As F2P, My problem is more thematic - I don't care about meta or late game content, so if this leads to powercreep, once I can't keep up I will just stop, I play for the fun I have today so stopping in the future does not represent loss to me. (I have the same relation to games I do spend on, I support the devs for the fun I have and not for the fun I might have in the future, so quitting is not a loss, not to me anyway)

What irk's me is that all players will experience the story the same, but some will spend 180 tickets and that makes Castorice like them more? While those that don't spent she will just ignore? What about the 0.6% players that get her with single ticket? Why are they treated differently for such low investment? Why are players who lose 50/50 ignored by her? The devs make her look like golddigger, intentionally or not."
"I see it as a positive. Makes pulling characters actually useful in the long term. When's the last time I used jinglui? Dill? Jing yuan? It's been ages. They are all wasted pulls to me now. Provide 0 benefit to my account. While someone like castorice will forever add benefit. Wish way more characters had global passives. Give silver Wolf one to always implant a weakness, Kafka one to add an extra DOT stack.blade one to replace in game music with my chemical romance."
"Sadly this doesnt matter to hoyo. As long as money comes in and they see green, nothing else matters. People need to vote with their wallets, but they never will in mass. People continue to cave into their matketing, same shit nintendo is about to experience. U as a player dont matter until their revenue gets shot"
Loads of people on the comments act like hoyo is not a company that wants what? MONEY
"nahhh, bad take."
"Nothing in this game is getting better. At this point it's just wearing people down leaving the slop eaters in Da Weis farm. Banner is going to go crazy in terms of sales and what's the damage? El Risitas get the list brother we got some comedy here.

The story still sucks. What's 3.2? 8 hours with MORE STATIC POSES? Did they really fix it? I saw the White screen black text and then laughed so hard because of how backhanded that fix seems. They already admitted to rewriting it but? Uhh?! Maybe 3.4 they mean?
A spending event? Great can't wait to see more of those. I also like logging into directly to a ""NEW CHARACTER PULL NOW!"" screen.
A terrible half assed fix at the 50/50 system. You can choose 3 characters out of the gutter. Well maybe 2, Fu is still ok.
The worthless character exchange tokens that require you to get E6 STANDARD CHARACTER... AND THEN YOU NEED 2 MORE LMAO. Who is this for? 
Global Passives. The worst one is out. A revive doesn't really do much but what else can you put on a global passive now? Here comes power creep 2.0.
More power creep. All the 3.0 characters are T0. Wow. Crazy.
Locking kit changing effects and team comps behind Eidolons and light cones. 
Relic farming is still garbage and we've gone through 3 band aid fixes. A fix on a fix on a fix all bottled necked. Unless you pay! Wow.. who woulda thought. 
Dot continues to remain dead and forgotten. Literally if you just allowed dots to crit and also proc when enemies were attacked it'd be fixed. Very strange I used those two specific examples almost like it's in the game somewhere. 

At this point I'm more interested in how much further they can go it's like a science experiment. I think it's ok to allow people to be flawed and play this game but at some point you do have to push back when the company goes crazy. The question is when and if."
Lol. That's what they meant when they said Castorice has a pull video? I thought the video would appear once we pull her. Rather than just her splash art. But this is just sad. Are they worried people won't pull for her? I'm genuinely confused. Why are they desperate?
You still gonna play?
The Dark Dragon from Final Fantasy IV is all grown up
Cipher better
"Pay to win rigged sloppy game enjoy the zero cycles, have all e6 s5 looking ahhs"
all this talk about “precedents” is just glorified doom-posting
this is how i feel about emblem rings in feh
"I'm fine with everything, it's enough for an anniversary celebration . It doesn't matter as long as I enjoy playing. Everybody is getting crazy bout Castorice being overpowered or destroying the game like that sort of thing.

I didn't spend any penny on this game, but still I got all the characters that I wanted, that helped me push to all the contents of the game, and even made this only account I had Stronger. 💪💪💪💪 

No, Stress and frustration of being broke, with just a game. 😊"
it not people are overacting my god
I dont think global passives are going to be a big issue goin forward
"Two things:
1. ""Cas' passive allows sustainless."" No it fucking doesn't. Sustainless is accessible to everyone, the only thing holding people back is fear of not having a sustain on the team and relic quality. You're talking like sustainless clears were impossible before. They weren't.
2. ""F2Ps can't keep up with the endgame"". I am sorry, but this is literally a skill issue. I spent only once on a monthly pass, and have been consistently clearing since 1.2 or so, when my account matured. The real issue lies in account mismanagement and genuine lack of knowledge, and I don't blame anyone except those who don't read out of principle. I recently visited my friend's account who couldn't beat the MoC, and beat it for them. With sustains on both teams. Using just my knowledge"
"I think in this situation Genshin has the better approach to Global passives. It's always some helpful, but relatively minor stuff. Like Raiden making polearm upgrades cheaper or Thoma giving more fish."
"Y'all should play WUWA : D 
Come ! We'll treat you better. Y'all deserve better !"
"Next global passive : removes LC path restriction 


/s (hopefully)"
It doesn't matter.
"This gane is hopeless... i got cas, she is TERRIBLY built with level 6 traces and she 2 cycled moc where my top 2% acheron woth her BiS team took 7 cycles..."
"I honestly dont care 😂 been playing for about a year, never spent a dime, and just got Castorice. Shes an icon, shes a legend, and I think everybody's being a little paranoid about the global passive. I actually doubt they'll keep going down this road, I think they just wanted to do something super new as a way to celebrate the 2nd anniversary and will stop there."
"Nah, i have to disagree on this one"
"The global passive just isn’t that big of a deal. The point of of the game is not even dying in the first place, and if you did, then that means your team is simply too weak"
I hope they make her passive a one time thing because she is an anniversary character. Like when Acheron was released and shattered all the damage ceilings.
"I'm so glad I left the game in 3.0, can't keep up with this shit, Hoyo wants us to pull for every character in the game atp."

there was a leak a few weeks ago that phainon will be having a global passive too💔"
"I know this is going to be sounding like whining, i knew what was coming up with the anniversary stuff..but the way the game immediately opened up to a CG of castorice and ""go to warp"", i thought i was watching the version PV(they play it in hi3 when you update and launch) but i was so flabbergasted by how in your face it was, that I just am not touching the app. It was just...so, in your face. This is really trivial though


This is sort of the writing on the wall, i can tell. Really hesitant to keep playing(I have spent 100 bucks and its been a year since I began playing, and I never have and never will spend again) even though I think a Fu Hua type expy might come with Marshal Hua or Cerydra. This was just...what??"
I think it's more worrying to put a spending event in the game. Tying rewards to spending money is a bad precedent to set
"I kinda disagree on f2p friendly aspects, since it’s by far one of the hardest games to go in f2p from my experience. Feature exclusive characters with high pity+50/50 is just super harsh when resources are thin and powercreep is especially strong."
Hail Global passive
Rather than skipping Castorice just skip this game
"While I do understand the issue on a whole, I thought the entire point of gacha was to have characters that do different things than the previous? The character passive isn’t the reason why you can’t clear🤨you can’t clear because of power creep and hp inflation"
"So the only issue everyone has with Castorice is her global passive?
Ask yourselves this question and answer yourself honestly:
How often do your characters die?

Even if they do, you mostly reset because you messed up your rotation somewhere somehow.
Not only that, but her passive isn't even a full on revive.

When Acheron came out noone complained her technique being able to instantly kill enemies.
But we all know exactly how good that technique is, even better than Castorice's passive.

But I do agree about powercreep, they are going overboard with enemy hp inflation. Even in main story sometimes enemies are really tough."
I hope you're feeling better now Vars!
kinda unrelated but does anyone know what that zzz video is on the right at 12:53 it looks sick haha
"Because they are Exploration Passives, not Combat ones. 

I think the only character with a combat-related Passive is Childe with the extra Level he gives to Normal Attacks but this only works if he is on the Team so it dont even counts"
"I wish the ""global passive"" were like genshin too. For example castorice should have been able to locate chests and puzzles like topaz maybe but for amphoreus only. Now I know it seems like a lot considering you literally don't have to struggle but Guides on youtube exists too which makes it a little bit balanced?"
HSR is beyond repairs right now.HSR is the greediest among the big 3 mihoyo games because they keep pushing the powercreep and implementing this global passive in combat to make players spend money frequently.I hope ZZZ will follow Genshin's powercreep path.Genshin has less powercreep but the game is still profitable.I don't know what HSR devs are thinking after seeing Genshin's success even without powercreep and global passive in combat but they still implement global passive in HSR
"@jarrygarry5316  powercreep is undeniable, but I'll wait and see how they implement the buffs to older characters that they promised."
"We can't. You want to villianize us for being HoYo refugees. There was an insane amount of vitriol and hateful rhetoric towards tourists and hoyo refugees following cantarella's trailer, and a bunch of new ppl are getting banned left and right for being hoyo refugees. Guess we'll have to wait for endfield or ananta then"
"I think people got really spoiled by Genshin Impact. If you look at HSR, HI3, and now ZZZ, GI is actually the only Hoyo game that doesn't have extremely high and aggressive/quick power creep.

But it's also their most popular and best-selling game. You'd think they would learn from that."
"Maybe I'm dumb but I think that they could just say ""global passives do not work in endgame content unless the character in question is on field"""
"is it just me or each update scream to me 'this is a business not a game'. For example, unskippable castorice animation upon first entering the game, 5 minutes high quality extremely emotional anime episode dedicated to castorice which is also unskippable, and the overall story being revolved around her and we spend the most amount of time with her. You see what I am seeing? this is not a story this is a 4 hour long promotion ad for castorice, and this is a more of a business rather than a game"
Would it still be bad if global passive are just for anniversary characters?
"It’s really kinda amusing how people when Honkai first released we’re going crazy (myself included though I didn’t think it would derail genshin or whatever )

saying how Honkai is so much more user friendly and generous then genshin.

little did we know that they were basically just front loading in order to on ramp people to the game. It basically didn’t matter how many characters they gave away or whatever because those units will be unusable in months maybe even less than that. It’s a shame really I had high hopes for this game since I really like turn based and sci fi space theme games but they also screwed that up making it way to easy to auto play thru which is like… what’s the point in that ?"
"do ppl even tried her global passive before making these bait ass videos. It doesnt heal u, its legit a safety net for w/e reason her hp drain causes ur teammate to die. It does not help ur 0 cycle team be more reliable, if it fulled heal after death sure but it doesnt. Use ur monkey brains at least"
"Other than the new world being so boring to trek through, this move with the global passive is whats going to keep me off from playing HSR, which is my favorite HYV game."
"in hsr the story revolves around selling you gacha characters

change my mind"
"0:33 - I know you like to act like HI3 doesn't exist, but it does. And everything they did now in HSR was done there already. Game is still played and exists. Stop doom posting!
In HI3 they:
- buffed older units individually to make them usable again
- still buff older favorite units (of players) to make them usable in part 2
- they have a bunch of global buffs
- they give away characters for free in different shapes and forms
- they let you buy certain older units with collectable tokens
....
None of these broke the game! In fact it made it so people can use their favs longer."
"I feel like hoyoverse is so inexperienced when running a turn based game, their only way of increasing end game difficulty add more hp on enemies and let newer characters deal more damage, with this hp inflation, even if they do buff characters, I think they will become irrelevant in a few months 
I don’t care if new characters are op, but I do care that my IL danheng’s 200k damage can’t even kill mobs in end game contents, that is how bad the endgame inflation is heading"
what if they just slap a global passive to old characters they said they would buff..
"just saying i’ve been playing the update for a while and only ONCE on ONE character has her passive ever triggered and then that was it. literally bring a healer and you don’t ever see it proc if it pisses you off ig.. unfortunately the implementation of Castorice’s passive means that future characters might also have this feature. i’m not trying to defend it, i just wish it only worked when SHE’S in the party"
I think Hoyo sees the regulations coming that will destroy Hoyo’s predatory monetization.
"I'm not being hyperbolic when I say that HSR has some of the worst powercreep of a modern gacha I have ever seen lol. If the character release schedules matched, HSR would be on par with FEH or CRK in terms of blatant hardcore powercreep and I'm being completely serious about this."
"From our perspective, it’s a dangerous precedent.
From their perspective, it’s an insane revenue."
"It really says a lot that the reactions to global passives are, at best, neutral. No one is happy about this, you either hate it, think it could be worse, or don't care."
Nah.. It's the best thing actually.  Let the f2p complain all day.
"this is inevitable, the only way to stop the increasingly pay to win aspect is to push for lawmakers to ban gacha entirely as a business model. imagine how much fairer for the consumer HSR, or any gacha game, would be if hoyo et al were legally barred from selling power and could only make money by directly selling cosmetics, or heaven forbid, charging a monthly subscription."
Once they start putting good passives on characters I don’t want idk man
"HP inflation is still the real problem and I wish people didn't drop that topic just because there's a new ragebait topic.

I couldn't care less if Castorice's global passive can one shot a boss, if my previously invested teams from last year can still achieve 36 star MOC."
"0:35 ""a decision that the company hasn't made since 2022"". I understand Jenshin and now HSR are the only popular Hoyo games, ok, i even like them and play them. But don't act like they're the only games. They have buffed older characters in other games since 2022."
This is why they stopped with the character quests! They put it in the main story so you can't skip their ad for the new banner!
Reminds me of Firefly...
"It’s frustrating for me because I called it but people didn’t listen just saying “genshin could never” whenever I pointed it out. Everyone was so happy getting what they wanted in genshin no one could see that it was a just a bribe to get people in and distract from its failings. Especially when I pointed out that a lot of freebies were a bad thing, gatchas giving out free stuff are not doing it out of generosity but a way to get people into the game, a just enough balancing act for its power creep, and for when the game is not meeting revenue expectations or 3-4 years old and player retention is naturally falling and they are trying to convince you to stay."
Star Rail was never user friendly and generous. That's the joke. That was the lie by fanboys who just wanted excuse to hate Genshin.
"Definitly, and for me Penacony was the biggest prove of that since you had a bunch of filler characters that were there just to sell a banner:

- Sparkles
- Boothill
- Rappa
- Fugue
- Jade
- Etc..."
That's literally every gacha.
Not genshin tho​ @Lewa500 
​ @abhinavanand9032 Are you sure??
That's evey gatcha game not just hsr
"@Albedomikans when the gacha story have a skip button and doesnt give a character 10 hours of screentime, yeah"
"That HP drain isn't problem.
My opinion: Castorice is anniversary character, but her kit is so boring. Meta over fun.
Good luck."
"Glad I'm not the only one who got pissed for acting like HSR and Genshin are the only games...
None of these actions are new... Or game braking. Stupid doom posting hype..."
"6:37 lmao im watching arcane right now, havent got here yet"
Hsr became more predatory quicker than Genshin. They really managed to fuck up a turn based game. I hope the people who pulled for Castorice enjoy her for the 2 versions until someone twice as strong comes out making her trash. And it will definitely happen and then people will move to that character like the scums they are.
"Global passives like this are a really cool concept for a big reward after a difficult questline or something...if we were talking about a normal rpg where it does not involve spending money. Given, the passive they gave Castorice is not that strong to begin with, even if you trigger the effect, any slap on he wrist will still knock you down for good. And a character going down realistically only happens in high difficulties of SU, this is never the reason you don't get 3 stars in any game mode, but a lack of damage output is. The only problem, as stated in the video, is that this opens the floodgates for more effects like this"
"I would also be okay with it if the buffs they are planning to give to Kafka, Jingliu, SW and Blade meant including global passives for them. Basically, slowly implementing globals for everyone (or at least every 5*) would be a good idea"
its funny how consumers dont actually care about being treated right unless they are being treated like literal garbage  cause who wants good quality when i can put a gold leaf on it and wow its shiny garbage now
"As long as global passives are whatever like Castorice i don't really see a problem in them(don't bring me examples where new bosses either have one shot like attack or bring HP of party to one, because reading mechanic explains how to stop boss from doing it or in case of new dragon boss we literally get healed while attacking boss. It can go out of hand for sure thou. But till i see signs of it happening i don't see big problem in that, i can't read future."
"Got killed in MoC 12 today. Got revived by Castorice. 3 stars.

Not sure how I feel."
"Genshin does have global passives, but they crucially provide no combat effect; Raiden and Wanderer's passives halve upgrade costs for certain weapon types."
11:25 Boothill is very wanted and appealing.
Hoyo never surprised me how shit they're at deciding stuff when it comes to their games
"I pulled for Castorice, because right now powercreep from global passives isnt an issue, but if it does in the future then I will consider it"
"Miss this game but it’s too much to go back to after a year off, i don’t wanna deal with only having what are now terrible characters and not being able to clear"
"Harmony emanator, thats for sure to get another global passive"
"I'm happy to see the CC's and their communities are in sync about the problems with a Global Passive. It's a shame that the vast majority of players are casual and likely do not consume content or media about the games they play. Castorice has some of the best animations in argueably all gacha, and I really like her design. However have still put my money where my mouth is and quit HSR. But for most, they cannot take that step. Understandable, but unfortunate. I can only hope this doesn't crack open Global Passive for other games, but we've seen the 50/50 system get popularized after Genshin did it."
"as much as i like Castorice as a character, i refuse to pull for her and i legitemetely hope her banner doesn't sell and is considered a failure. we DON'T want global passives and the only way to stop Hoyo from doing it again is for her to be the worst selling unit. sadly i already know that's not happening cause the discord servers i'm in are already full of people celebrating pulling her or complaining about losing 50/50s trying to."
"They better make an game-entry animation for each upcoming new character, because if castorice is the only one that gets glazed by them so incredibly hard, she officially will become my most hated character ..."
The amount of people that don't get or refuse to believe that this is only the beginning is concerning.
"This is what Favouritism looks and feels like people, castorice has everything that we dont have."
"""For them to make such an unprecedented move"" correct, and that is sad. It is pretty standard for gacha games to buff older characters. FGO, Fate, Nikke, etc. This is quite standard, but not for Hoyo. But if people only play Hoyo, they see and praise this. This...isn't praiseworthy. This should be standard and expected."
"""Boothill... isn't very appealing market wise."" 

Now what kind of shirtbag told you a thing like that?"
" @riguor9876  But as you well said, they are crafting and development passives, that don't impact cambat at all. So not having them doesn't put you at a disadventage. Another thing is, crafting passives are optional, as you can choose to not use them even if you have the character that has the passive. But Castorice isn't like that, as her passive is both global and exclusively active. You can't choose to not use it after you get her."
"I think they said it’d be only her.

If Anaxa doesn’t have one I’m rioting though."
"You are not only player.
I played her trial.
Castorice is huge disappointment to me, even more disappointing after trial😢.
Acheron is much more fun to me.😊😊
My opinion:true anniversary characters:
ZZZ: Vivian and Hugo,
Genshin: Escoffier and Ifa,
Wuwa: Zani and Ciaccona!😊
Star rail: Anaxa, Hyacine and Cipher.
Never Castorice (to me).
(And dragon😢, Genshin Neuvillette😊).
Good luck for pulls!😊"
"She is an anniversary char, ofc they would glaze her🙂still not enough glaze for me to pull for her😂❤"
"heard anaxa isn't getting one but hopefully just because he debuts in phase 2.
let's hope 3.3 phase 1 has animations as well..."
"If Phainon, who is the ""MC"" of Amphoreus doesn't get this treatment...."
Guys don't get the same treatment so I keeps hopes in the basement with Screwllum
Shes the anniversary character so...
@kyarumomochi5146  but Anaxa also...
 @akarifuyuki9763  actual anniversary started from this date. Hence why its only first phase. Not yo defend hoyo but this is what they did for all of their games
" @kyarumomochi5146  I know, doesn't mean I like it."
 @akarifuyuki9763  I literally states the same thing
 @kyarumomochi5146  Oh sorry I don't know
Boohoo a piece of pixels made me cry boohoo
⁠ @akarifuyuki9763 the goat got it
The amount of people extrapolating bad outcomes based on nothing is what is concerning
"@alhosaintaher8435  did you even watch the video? Vars says FOR NOW it's not too bad, but once more character get global passives it becomes a whole new game of whether you have those characters or not."
"@renbananacatsoup5343  then complain about it when it happens. Global passives can be very bad or very good depending on the direction the game takes. Saying it will be bad is nothing but making predictions over nothing. Once they become bad then we can make a big deal about it and I will support you but until then, it is nothing but complaining about things that haven't happen"
" @alhosaintaher8435   do you really trust a gacha company to do you good? How is a limited global passive good in any way? they already implemented global passives in a bad way! When the character with an op passive releases then it's gonna be too late, prevention is better than a cure."
"⁠ @alhosaintaher8435 complain it when it happens? NO. we should complain it BEFORE it happens

when we know if something bad can be happen, we should AVOID it. take the other better option/direction

let’s use our brain"
" @setetesairhina  You should look at GBF, the global passives are on every major grand characters and they are celebrated, put on the top of tier lists. They are willing to pay for those and let those HP inflation continue unabated. 

If global passives are already more than ok there, nothing here is gonna make a difference."
" @setetesairhina  then you are complaining about your imagination, why stop there, complain that there are no more free pulls in the future and that characters now need to be e8 to unlock Thier passive that kills all endgame without playing it"
"everytime I see this argument I bring up the following remember when Acheron released and she is able to kill overworld enemies and everyone basically said the same that is is broken and they can now just remove all overworld enemies because all caharacters will have that now and in the end in was just her the anniversary character, maybe just maybe it is the same effect here that because Cas is the anniversary character she has a unique skill.

I am not saying it might not happen but all I am saying maybe don't throw the baby out with the bathwater just yet, people are too quick to judge when something similar happened a previous time and nothing else came of it, it was unique to only ever 1 character."
" @Gr1mTid3  that was an over world technique which had no practical use in endgame content, this ""exclusive passive"" affects every game mode it's essentially a different game that revolves around whether you have that character or not. That is not even in the same league as Acherons technique."
"​ @renbananacatsoup5343  No practical effect in end game content Acheron made DU super quick and easy to clear as well as any event that has overworld enemies with Acheron you can complete most if not all story content without having to worry about health issues her Technique is extremely useful but also changes the game if you have her vs if you don't.

Castorice on the other hand if you have not experienced the moon cocoon effect yet is very nuanced and unless you finely plan to the last detail including when the boss will hit you will not help 1 bit for the most part as an example I tested her skill and played really badly as I have actually built my characters and have sustains that keeps me from dying but I went and played like the worst possible and depending if you have luck and how quick your other characters are the effect of moon cocoon will be useless the following was the 2 scenarios I found.


1. RMC was too quick so before my sustain could act they already got their next turn and thus they died cause unlike what CCs are telling you your character cannot act again they literally only have till their next turn to get a shield or heal if not they die as their turn comes around.
2. Lingsha was killed during the first swipe of Flame reaver (Shocking I know Lingsha never dies but as I said I had to play super bad to see effect) she got resurrected flame reaver went into second swipe and Lingsha died.

sometimes yes you will get lucky, and her skill can help but it is not worth throwing the baby out with the bath water over that possible chance that you might be saved by a unique skill that is probably given to her due to it fitting her lore and her being an anniversary character.
but her skill only works once so if for example the flame reaver swipe its swipes kill a character they get resurrected if he swipes again and that kills characters, they do not get resurrected

If I had to choose between Castorice and Acheron I would say Acheron is the more broken mechanic and changed the game much more than Castorice that is a good unit but has a buff that will probably if ever (dependent on how good, you play) mostly work out on her party as she sucks the life force dry of everyone around her."
Whenever hoyo buffs an old character it's hidden by a new limited character
"fr, like what the fudge"
"Boothill everyday than Castorice.😊❤
My opinion, good luck for pulls!😊"
@AP-d2f  definitely going for his next rerun 🔥
What sort of a son of a nice lady told him that?
"I like Boothill but unfortunately for all intends he is a filler character that barely had screan time, relevancy or any type of dedicaded event. 
The guy dont even have a Story Quest meanwhile LUKA, the random 4* from Belobog got one."
"​ @Truck-kun11 Castorice doesn't have one either. They just don't do story quests now. Boothill actually took a big part in Penacony and then in the story with Rappa. He has more screen time than T Herta, Fugue, Rappa, Argenti, Ratio."
​ @ginichimaruan3572 I'd argue that Argenti and Ratio had a bit more screen time than Boothill
"​@AP-d2fI agree,"
"This character singlehandedly killed any hope of me ever returning to star rail after quitting it version 2.7. I was already extremely disappointed with what they did with fuge, basically just shoving her into sunday's quest for no good reason, but all the hp inflation everywhere honestly was killing any interest in the game already. 
You know your game is done messed up when even genshin is far more balanced (yes, im well aware of how broken mavuika is, but people have been consistently clearing abysses with only 4* characters, 7 out of 8 being from version 1 as an example. Whenever i fail at getting 36 abyss stars i feel as through its my own skill issue, not an issue of literally not being able to deal enough damage)."
where are the people that say hsr is so generous to its players
"Eh? didn't we establish after release that casto global passive isn't really big deal? Before release I do agree and concern, too, that the next characters will have more ""meta"" global passive but looking at play now just feels like a nice QoL.
You can get hit immediately after ressu with 1 HP before enemy actions. Get hit again then it is die for sure.
It's a nice safety net but still with chances.
And when she's on the party (more safety net from the dragon) but that's sacrificing her dragon's HP thus lowering personal dps, I think that's a fair game.
Powercreep are there too so this problem would pronounce more on game like Genshin, or Arknight that had really slow pace and took a long time for rerun (heck even AK rerun banners are miracle)

While these global passive can be debatable, Now I do concern more on people who thought this time hoyo ""goes too greedy"" with a lot of anniv bundles. Here I'm questioning why they had less reward and less bundles compared to other gacha. Idk about HI3, but 4 years on Genshin, 2 years on HSR (and waiting for ZZZ), I feel like they really tanking everything from the gacha revenue, which is make sense, but I still think they holding a lot on these bundles.

HSR do have problems, but now I'm starting to think twice to engage with the community problems on this game. I thought I can learn one or two about something/logical thinking from others... now I can't differentiate between good argument and -just-wanna-whine-on-everything anymore.
Does this how it feels like when people said don't engage to the community? I think I understand now."
"Just pull for ""game changer"" characters like Castorice and stop pulling for crippled ones. EASY!! Me, personally would stop pulling after Castorice and just wait for the next ""big thing"".
Also, pulling for characters you like is the most brainless way of using your limited resources  cox it's not even an open world game like Genshin where you can roam using you favorite character. Sheess!!!😂

Btw, HSR on the next gacha pvp will get top 1 💯 beating that p*rn game called LADs and that pokemon junk. 😂"
All hell is going to break loose now. I'm still in shock that global passives are a thing. There is already one thing for an upcoming character that is the subject of speculation and... yikes.
How many people actually play endgame. If not much than this passive will be not all that conterversial. It is for endgame players but i think this is something hoyo is thinking.
"This game is doomed, I will enjoy it while it lasts and once it reaches that point of no return I will be ready to say goodbye"
"I still can't get over how people hate the passive, yes it's a global passive and yes it means they might do it again unfortunately,  but people forget it's ONE REVIVE PER BATTLE.  Seriously what difference will it make if they keep stronger and stronger bosses non-stop.  Besides Mydei gets like 7 revives and does the same amount of damage plus can easily solo content even at e0 so again what difference does this passive make like literally.  

It's almost as bad as the people complaining about Mydei's auto battle niche. Heaven forbid a character is actually unique in gameplay compared to others.   I honestly feel like it's the same with ac shadows and it's just everyone being negative for no reason.  I don't live on the internet but I have noticed a huge increase of negativity lately whether it's for games or movies or music or whatever.  Like what the hell happened lately.  The internet today is filled with negativity and then borderline pronography with everyone being addicted to it, like are we evolving backwards or something?  Again I don't live on the internet or have any forms of social media, which thank god for that, so I honestly wouldn't know."
"""Precedent"" = ""What if this... What if that... What if these... What if those... What if...""

I'm so tired of this."
"I don't hate the idea of global passives. there's only so much you can do with unique characters in a turn-based game, especially when elemental reactions don't play as big a role. but this is something that needed to exist from the beginning of the game, and needs to be limited - say, you can only have one or two global passives active at a time, something like elemental resonance from genshin. not ideal, but then, I think if this was in hsr from the start and it wasn't so powerful right off the bat, I don't think anyone would be complaining


(context: I don't play hsr, just genshin lmao I'm sorry if I'm missing context. took one look at the game being turn-based and noped out of there and I'm glad I did)"
The only global passive in genshin is just Thomas fishing passive lmao. This crap better not carry over there

"Next is they gonna make a global passive of giving the all the characters a 6% speed (something like that).

Edit: Or Atk% and Break effect"
"Yeah I am part of the problem unfortunately, this passive is a terrible idea and precedent, but all the sales are too juicy and useful for me not to use, cause I want pretty much every upcoming character 
Thank god tho they are ACTUALLY buffing units and ALSO moved old units into the pity pool AND gave a free Ruan mei so frankly the scales have completely balanced out (imagine the other game doing half of this 💀💀💀🤣🤣)"
"unrelated but can you maybe get a better mic setup? your audio always has this awful reverb, it's jarring to listen to your videos as background noise. I don't have this problem with other videos"
Milking views for a game you dont play 👌
"I am of the opinion that Hoyo will destroy HSR purely based on greed and will not do anything to truly address any of the core problems. What they've been doing so far is introduce more powercreep or storytelling elements (stronger characters with hp sponge enemies that require the character to even clear comfortably, excessive yap and white text on black screen) and are trying to bandaid it with character buffs  that will be obsolete in 1 patch and black text on white screen. With how badly they've been milking the game, I guarantee you they'll make more of these permanent problems and offer temporary solutions until the game is well and truly dead."
"It's already happening. As I said in another video:

For me, what's also an issue is that Hoyo will scale HSR's endgame to the latest shiny unit they have. They buffed the enemies' HP for Acheron's release, then Feixiao and now most likely for Castorice.

So she has an auto-revive (which used to be reserved for older units' E2) that can activate even when she's not in the party. Gee, I wonder if they'll release enemies with insta-death abilities or deal damage that can bypass shields and leave your units at 1 HP... Wait a minute?"
"It's anniversary for Hoyo, not for players"
Genshin could never 😂
People still clear MOC with 4*s it just requires good relics and gameplay
​ @tfemrobin  Was it around 70 tries with insanly good gear?
"I'll try to add perspective. And preface by saying to enjoy whatever game you want, not judging you. The people that feel her global passive isn't a problem likely just ignore the valid points people make. Everyone kept saying yes, her particular passive isn't broken or godlike. That isn't what people are talking about. It is the obvious precedent they are making, trying to normalize this which inherently makes the game (and potential other gachas) more predatory than they already are. 




They already did this with Genshin btw. Constellations? That wasn't standard in gachas. Duplications in gachas traditionally just give stats and that is it. Genshin helped normalize tying critical aspects of a characters kit to there dupes and sometimes weapons, which of course makes the game more predatory. Acheron troubling you with that Nihility restriction? Well...let me tell you about her E2. Similar case with global passives. They dip there toes in the water, conditioning players to accept it, then gradually increase how powerful they become to entice more money and resources. It is standard 101 stuff. 

Not trying to be toxic or hateful towards you btw. If you enjoy the game and Castorice, more power to you. Please, enjoy any video game you want. Just offering perspective. Maybe you didn't see what people meant because plenty in the community are ultra toxic and pad there criticisms with a ton of insults. Hopefully I conveyed this respectfully to you."
"​ @GodofGoblins  o yea ya you good, thank you even, yours doesn't sounds aggressive and more reasonable. 

I do wanna add too that I don't really follow news + Casto doesn't grab my attention (not pulling her) so when the global passive news pops up everywhere I thought ""maybe this is really a big problem, even I don't look for it, the recommendation are everywhere"" so It spark my curiosity on how Casto played out after release. And that's my comment on that.

Now I think about it, yea, Genshin copies do give value on action+number compared to others that just give small stats.
But what's predatory about it? Isn't that how developer get creative with what they sell? And how it give player another experience from the chars?
I play Genshin F2P and still feel rewarded without copies, plus there's no need for cons or even sign weapon. I think this is the 2nd game I played after AK that doesn't made me feel pressured to pull every banner. I can't say the same for HSR, some chars made me need to pull sign, but it doesn't hinder my progress on End Game, still all clear.
Gacha nowadays just need to gain game experience and manage account better, right?
Or I am missing the point cause I just start reading here and there about game and how they perceive just around this year."
"So you realize the second part of your sentence is countered by the first part right? You literally just said it. The issue isn't the power level of the current passive. Everyone basically agrees, it isn't ultra powerful or a big deal. It is the precedent it leaves for them to obviously push for stronger ones, which leads to a more predatory environment than it already is. And its Hoyo...of course they will. 



They can go ahead and release a global passive that does some def shred. You don't counter the argument with ""ok but I have a character that can def shred."" Again, you need to see the obvious bigger picture here. Before you know it, they will start doing global passives where you get an extra turn, and you decide to say ""ok but bronya can give me another turn so like..."" Look, just like how they try to normalize constellations in Genshin, this is another means to try and make the game more predatory to make money. Its simple. Not hating or judging you btw. If you like the game, please continue to enjoy. Just stating the obvious. Yes it is an issue, but if you don't care that is fine. Enjoy. But if you don't understand why its an issue, hopefully I elaborated on that a little."
"You did not watch the video. The problem is not the passive, but rather what it represents. Today is a revive, tomorrow it will be crit, and the day after break damage, and then def and hp, and then more, and more, and more...

Pretty much the only thing i do agree with has to be the social media part filled with negativity, but everything else is wrong."
So tired that whatever predictions have happened are true? Yea this game is ruined. Enjoy Castorice for the 2 months while she is replaced by a better character.
" @Riyozsu  No. I'm tired of this absolute victim mentality that have been plaguing y'all. It's almost as if you lot have been asking for these to happen, if anything."
Then why are you here
 @winstonlin4451  no actual arguments = be reductive instead 🤡
Pollux: Allow me to introduce myself.
Hsr could never
"I think people forget that even global passive can be designed in myriad ways that can be less offensive like increase crit rate by 10% for two turns.

Or need two abundance to increase heal% by 10%.

It really can be designed to be less game breaking and not as annoying. People need to really stop this level of fear when it hasn't even happened."
"Great. first, a dangerous president of a certain North American country. Now, a dangerous precedent of a certain passive of a new character.

whether president or precedent, they’re all dangerous."
"Love seeing how people say “it’s just a PVE game “

They were the same one complaining about the HP inflation and the dangerous powercreep"
well good fucking job hoyo you make wan't to play other gacha game excited for ananta
"Didn't know about Castorice's passive until now, but in seeing this I do feel like the most likely outcome is a pretty simple one.
Having played Genshin since day 1 I know what a dev who barely pays it's community any notice looks like. And while the dev team of Genshin gives us things we want four to five years down the line, HSR is pretty quick to listen, and in my opinion has been doing a pretty good job of it too.
I think this way; Castorice has this passive to be cool and themey and to apply FOMO... Fomo that I suspect is fake.
Because while slightly worse I'd suspect that the next TB is going to have a similar passive. Let's say it's Abundance.
It'll be slightly weaker to incite you to buy Castorice on reruns, say ""The death's door effect is only cancelled if healed to FULL or shielded 100% of their health."" kind of thing. And heck, maybe doesn't even require TB to be in Abundance. It seems pretty thematic that ""the 'benefits' of Abundance come with consequences you can't get rid of"" it's kinda Yaoshi's whole thing."
"I think the thing that pisses me off about it is that rather than owning it, hoyo is going full ""there is no war in ba sing se"" on the whole situation, like it doesn't even register as a blip on their metaphorical radar."
"I really do think that global passive isn’t a big of a deal

First of all: this is a PVE game. If it was a PVP yeah, that would be a broken ability to have

Second: there are other characters that have unique talents or mechanics that give quality of life improvements in the game (Acheron’s technique being able to delete mobs without entering a fight, Firefly’s technique being able to easily delete the pigs for that mini game in the simulated universe, Ruan Mei’s also has a bonus in SU, Topaz or Herta’s that can locate chests… you get the point)

Third: even if you “revive”, you have to be healed or shielded asap otherwise the character will die. And if you die in this game, then you should consider rework your team or tweak the builds of your characters. Not saying is a skill issue at all. But if I die in a battle I often re-start and try another approach."
Would yall stop grifting on the global passive.  It's not a big deal ffs
"The unique passive is not that much of game breaker unless you have some very speed tuned healers (which I guess Hyacine will be, but that's up for air). It happened to me several times on DU and opponents are so fast that the revived party member dies again immediately. And it only happened ONCE per battle. In long term boss raids, it could be clutch. But considering they also upped the speed of enemies plus most of them doing stray AoE attacks, yeah, the usefulness just drops significantly. I guess it was actually busted before with multiple usage per battle and a hefty sum of HP once revived but was super nerfted from the beta experience backlash. I'm not defending it, its still an awful system. I'm just saying that people are getting too riled up over it.

Unless they make another one that heals a party member on very critical HP...in conjunction with this. Now that's when we really get mad."
5:22 dude whats the point of adding spoilers??
It’d be interesting to see if they do make global passives for the purpose of buffing older units. It could be a way to revitalise the early roster. Heck maybe our general will get a buff this way too
I pray that hoyo somehow shuts down.
"Genuinely, if i dont like the char I will regret pulling. I got castorice and really regret it bc i dont like her, however her global passive did make me force myself to pull, plus shes a good teammate for mydei. Idk… i felt reallypressured to get her and it SUCKS."
"""Once you obtain this character, when there're enemies with 1% HP, their HP will be depleted entirely. 
This skill is active even if the character isn't in the party""

""After obtaining this character, when teammates energy needs were nine or less to reach max energy, this character will provide the needs so they have full energy.
This skill is active even if the character isn't in the party"""
A huge mistake with a huge income this month. Can't wait for my monthly gacha PvP and see if HSR beats Pokemon and Love & Deepspace.
"It isn’t a big deal. Whenever I did die in MoC the run was over. It’s just a pretty animation. 

It is cool tho."
I quit the game before even found out about Castorice global passive... I'm feeling very vindicated right now.
Also adding another dangerous precedent - the precendent that HSR team won't listen to community negative feedback even if the feedback is loud and clear since they could get away with it. LOL
Castorice is my favorite character in the game and I got her today she’s so amazing she’s already doing 100k damage like I don’t even have all her traces maxed out yet like I pre farmed for her and she’s doing pretty well
"something i really wish is that they would finally allow characters to have more than one skill and an ultimate, there's only so much you can do with two options, resulting in overloaded kits for new characters and the game feeling more restrained with time"
People love doomposting
"Cas itself is fine.

But what will the next global passive be? +20 speed? Get extra true damage per followup attack? Get additional crit rate for each turn you aren't hit by an enemy? +20% energy gain? 

Time will tell"
again its not the passive its the problems that come after in the future
@ are you coming from the future?
@ if i say yes would u believe me?
 @YellowLeaf-lc6  perhaps 👀 lol
" @YellowLeaf-lc6  Hey, and I'm coming from the past. I think Acheron's ability to destroy overworld enemies without fights will destroy this game. Think about it, they will now release every unit after Acheron which will be able to kill units without ever engaging in a fight with them! There will never be any gameplay now!"
@ but the thing is archeron cant kill big mobs and her killing isnt global like in the cutsence like she killed adventurine. Imagine if they actually do like what i said ill suck da wei dickk all days.
Mr. Pokke will instantly pull for that first one! 🤣
Negative feedback from SOME of the community. You'd be surprised how few people really care
"​ @fluWmiR these people who ignore the situation be like: ""I love Casto, she's my wife! So I don't care about the passive, because I anyway will have her on my account!"". Let just wait to see their faces, when Hoyo will starts implementing such a passives for the future gameplay-shitty characters, like incoming Anaxa."
" @fluWmiR  perhaps. Doesn't change how valid the existing feedback is though. ""Few"" is relative and considering how much traction this topic got,  it's definitely bigger than other community concerns. And if they still don't listen because they consider it still ""few"" people caring, that's all the more a dangerous precedent."
The only feedback they'll listen to is how much money the Castorice banner will make.
You’d be surprised for the amount of White Knights who thinks criticism is bad for the game
"@guyonyoutube501 sadly, seems to be the likely case. But I am holding out hope. They've been known to listen to community feedback in the past."
Some of us want the passives XD
"@quint2568  and you're entitled to wanting it. The same way we are entitled to think it's a net negative, with all of the video's points and more."
"what's interesting is that the only community that really cares about this are western players. apparently players in CN or asia don't care very much about the global passive. At the end of the day, it sounds like hoyo care more about their local CN community than global/overseas because they spend more."
" @wizirbyman  The CN community is already fustrated enough over powercreep and HP inflation in MOC. Global passive isn't even worth (Probab second priority) discuss compare to how the character powercreep insanely. I remeber see a vid of comparing 6+1 (C6+Signature Lightcone) Jingliu vs. 0+1 The Herta, and the discussion about the powercreep stacked up in the comments."
"@wizirbyman  I've heard the opposite. Some sources were saying even the Chinese side were generally against it during beta that they thought they'd roll it back, which made it more surprising they didn't."
If it came from the cn player base it would matter
"nobady cares about a loud minority of clowns in global, games was top 1 for days in china, jp, kr , etc HoYo doenst listen to clowns that get their ideas from cc drama"
"​@guyonyoutube501
This is true.
People criticized the Mavuika/Citlali dual banners in the same phase, and it resulted in... Over 90 Million dollars in revenue for HYV.

So yeah. They called the community's bluff, and sadly, the community folded."
Oh Castorice is getting a global passive? Well it's not really good. Oh she's getting an anime styled PV. Okay that's good I guess... She got three ASMR styled videos.... that's a good place to stop. She's going to be the one to save all of amphoreus? Okay Alright... She got a her own unique loading screen? It's enough slices!!!
How did my guy complain about something in a gacha game whilst promoting a top-up website? Hyprocite at it's finest 😭
"I have a feeling they will give a free unit that gives a global passive to soothe the pain of ppl still playing the game , then release another absolute unit with a good global passive."
This comment section is infuriating. So many people assume the worst about everything
"To be honest the problem isn't hoyo or the power creep is the player themselves, they are just pay and pay over and over at this rate hoyo can't  even see any problem with that (look the players are paying and having fun) and they actually make an auto character that you can't even control and people still paying for it, if people stop paying and make hoyo at the edge they will start to see the problem and see the content creators videos and start understanding the problem because they don't play their own game."
"Ok but realistically i think it will be a one time thing. Acheron, the previous anniversary unit, is the only one who can skip entire fights. Not as impactful but it is a one time thing"
The worst thing is Hoyoverse is going to see Castorice make a lot of money because of the top-up and how hard they were shilling her and executives are going to see the sales and interpret as people wanting more global passives
BGM from fire emblem?
The thumbnail is pretty tho. Castorice is pretty.
"Realistically, Castorice's global passive is a QoL at best. It's a safety net for when an uppity Amphoreus enemy scores a cheap one-shot on a member of your team.

It's why I expect any future global passives to focus on account-wide QoL. 

My prediction? The next global passive will be an EHR% buff, as it's a notoriously difficult stat to build around, and a major weakness of the Nihility path."
I stopped playing months ago and I’m so glad I stopped there were so many characters I wanted in order to complete end game content but the insane power creep this game brought was too much and daily’s became a chore along with the events (plus no skip button)
"This whole patch gives greedy. The game rakes in millions yet Hoyo feels the need to blatantly leech money off its playerbase who have a cult-like attachment and admiration for the game. 

They're also doing a blatant tactic where they test the waters with a new mechanic and either continue making these global passives just as or more broken, or, in an attempt to manipulate the player-base into thinking they listened, they will make these passives slightly less impactful, but will still not remove them completely cause they know sweats will still pull for even a +10 attack boost (see Honkai Impact 3rd) 

I used to enjoy Hoyo games but the greed is biblical levels. I wish people held gacha companies as accountable as infamous companies like EA as their money practices and nickel-and-diming are shockingly similar. 

It's sad that a company I was willing to give some leeway to for the overall quality of their games have sunk so low. But if you give a download, they'll ask for $200."
At this rate What happened to acheron? coming up soon 😭😭
Honestly even IF global passives didn’t exist powercreep is real and some crazy wacky units will probably surpass all these characters in the future
I can't wait for a global passive that gets stronger the more copies of a character you have.
the fire emblem heroes shade😭
"the issue with all this powercreep is new players wont have all these limited characters that are necessary, they will atbest have 1-2 limited characters and a standard 5 star with a bunch of 4 stars that will suck"
okay im just saying to those who think the passive ain't turbo broken: I've been able to clear moc 12 with her passive alone no sustain.
I have castorice and her unique passive is useless 😅.
"They don't even care about the blackscreen, they literally changed it into white lmao"
"FR the favoritism is crazy i feel bad as an anaxa fan, watch him get only 1 pv and no lore trailer"
​ @viixine7666  Boothill situation all over again ༎ຶ⁠‿⁠༎ຶ
"And she's not even a real flame chaser. We're only getting 3 of the original, it's stupid. 
No moebius, not even worth playing until Elysia is out."
Istg if Phainon doesn't get this Castorice treatment considering that he's like the MC of Amphoreus 😤😤
​ @viixine7666  na the worst part is he is dead before he is available.
"At this point, she's a Mary sue"
​ @Armadan7 dumbass it's a different universe tf do you expect 💀
"She's not saving Amhoreus, she didnt even do anything memorable in quest, she's just a bland boring character"
"​ @Qihwjsishwjsdb  she's pretty good story wise,  but hoyoverse is glazing her way too hard and its kinda not her character problem but how she is executed."
"Bro, the one who saves Amphoreus will be Trailblazer/Phainon. We know that since 3.0. Literally Phainon is glazed in the story as the savior. Though I'm not surprised that conspiracy theorists aren't thinking straight."
you would have to pray for hoyo to even care a little about their male characters 😭 ​ @viixine7666 
Don't be naive. Corporations can't be trusted to exercise any level of restraint.
@artisticcannibalism1350 smh
@Dia_D_Auth   You're the one who clicked on this video and decided to insert yourself into the conversation. Take responsibility for your actions and stop complaining.
 @artisticcannibalism1350  my fault for expecting people to be more reasonable in the comments
" @Dia_D_Auth  I apologize for my earlier comment I had you mistaken for someone else.

However the discussion and conclusions are reasonable... You just don't like the obvious conclusion."
 @artisticcannibalism1350  it's a pessimistic conclusion
"@Dia_D_Auth   Sometimes people are correct to be pessimistic, this is one such case. Hoyo is a corporation and like any other corporation their goal is to make money and they've been financially rewarded for their decision here."
They don't design a UI for a 1 time thing
"the difference is that acheron can only skip fights against trash mobs which only saves you time, meanwhile castorice passive could save your moc/pure fiction/whatever run if you get randomly oneshot"
"I don't think they'll do stat buffs. It will tiny no consequence bonuses, like ""with Cypher on your team, there is a >1% chance for regular enemies to drop relics"" or ""whenever a character is healed, apply a small shield"", ""at the end of every cycle, the lowest health enemy is hit with an arrow dealing 10,000 true dmg"", etc."
"yep but the problem is that most of the chinese communtity have no standards and no backbone, they fold like paper with just a couple freebies."
"I'm just grateful HSR isn't made by EA, because if it was then you wouldn't even be able to attempt to play MoC without paying a fee, and you'd start with 5 cycles left and have to pay to add more"
She's getting a buff when Cipher comes out
"Shh, we can’t let Hoyo get ideas"
You just gave them a dangerous idea my dude.
what about global passive that only actiave if you 5 of spesific character like exodia
​ @swwl5461 & each of their sig cones are required
" @swwl5461  that would be fking crazy, but I think people would still go for it lol"
"The next global passive can be ""immune to all types of ccs"", when encounter cc, the cc effect will be dispelled and converted to a ""double-bladed buff"". THIS would def blow things up."
My bet is entire game modes will be locked behind owning a gacha character
 @swwl5461  5 characters all e6 with their signature weapons cause why not
Waiting for the global passive that adds a skip button
Then just play the game for longer??
If the powercreep is so bad then won't having just one new unit be enough for them to clear the game?
@ you need two teams for all 3 end game modes and you will still need sustainers
@ no ones gonna stick it out for months to get enough characters to know if its fun for them
" @luckiestluck819  then just don’t play it, why complain when you can play a better game with “less power creep”"
that's how it works for every gacha game out there tho for new players? like how the hell you play a gacha game for 1 week to 1 month and expect them to dabble in endgame content already? the people that play the endgame didn't even make 10% of the total playerbase too and this is before said HP inflation were a thing
"that how the game work buddy, not just star rail but all game is like that"
"Yeah I dont think people in these replies get it, every time some player comes back from like say a 3 month break, the meta is just always changing and the limited characters they had before are now useless, and so they feel tempted to pull and spend money so they can keep up with the meta, thats the strat for them. Cause at lesst in Genshin, you can definitely do many of the games progress with just 4 stars honestly"
"@ this meta only affects the endgame tho, you can still clear story and events with old characters. heck old characters can still even be used in MoC but only up to floor 10, floor 11 and 12 has always been stages for FOMO for the new banner characters and it's always been like that ever since floor 11 and 12 got introduced. you only miss out 1 pull if you don't clear floor 11 and 12 it's not that deep man"
" @mysteriousdora6914  3 month break for what, might aswell quit."
"@ Oh idk maybe because of simply just burnout in general? Are you really gonna be playing an rpg game 24/7, for what exactly? I can’t imagine actually not getting tired of this game unless you’re a whale, and also it probably couldn’t even be just 3 months. Fugue was meta for one patch and now she’s literally useless."
" @ItsBiox  Yes, why do you think I mentioned the break, I’m aware it’s endgame, that’s the issue in itself. Are you sure I’m the one making it deep when you just tried to explain the moc to me? Regardless it still doesn’t change the fact that old characters are just getting overshadowed left and right"
" @mysteriousdora6914  you only miss few pulls if you cant clear endgame

80 jades for moc12, 160 for moc11,and 240 for moc 10

Which is just 1 and half pull, you miss 3 month worth of jades but concerned about 1 and half pull,really?"
"@ The game isn’t just relevant to moc, there’s still difficulties like boss fights or a couple of weekly bosses. You most likely would need certain 5 star characters, specifically at least a good support, to withstand some of the mechanics that bosses havs"
" @mysteriousdora6914  you can adjust the difficult if you struggling

Complain and complain did you really play the game? You can easily clear the story boss if you really build you character and read boss mechanic for example you need aoe or blast character to win dice game in aventurine boss and dont forget there no cycle to win the boss story so you can stalling as much as possible with 2 sustain if your character keep dying"
"@ issue is, end game has a lot of the gems, especially if you dont min max by doing every event and all the crappy side quests/exploration, and even if you dont bother with floor 12, 10 and 11 are being made significantly harder than it was just a year ago"
" @zensenmoyatte  No, im just gonna skip and play another game that respects my time instead"
" @luckiestluck819  what months ? the permament pulls in the game are like 800 , new players can even have stronger teams than you

Returning players is the issue , because you will have exaust a lot of those permamnet rewards"
"I have a sneaking suspicion that's just there to make you think of how useful it is, watch it be completely useless outside of that boss and in the future. They do this all the damn time.

It doesn't make the situation better because it's just about the six week fomo cycle again"
Missed the point of the videoooooo
​@HerrscherOfKugisaki Wouldn't that also mean that future character's global passive would also be useless? Think NPC think!
​ @xenosaber77 What an insanely foolish thing to say... Why would you trust the corporation infamous for its power creep not to do the thing that it has already done repeatedly?
 @artisticcannibalism1350  Cause i don't really care? It's that simple
 @xenosaber77  If you don't care then don't get involved in the conversation. This is easy.
WAIT NOW THEYRE BLINDING US???
oh great. now my oled screen is gonna get burn in 3 minutes faster. gg hoyo
To be fair the black screen still existed but i wanna say i saw it less than ten times in the 3.2 quest 😂 unlike 3.0
"11:21
No, we are not lucky that the first set of global passive is in a wanted character, Hoyo only made Castorice have the first global passive because  they Knew they could get away with it.
Castorice was beloved, everyone wanted her, anniversary refreshed the shop and gave motives for people to waste more money, so ofc, this month will be their biggest revenue EVER in Hsr story. Which basically means they can add global passives without any trouble because they did it first, and it sold greatly"
"We all know this isn't going to kill the game, we all know this will sell well, we all know this will only get worse, we all know people will continue playing 

They are going so hard on her in just about everything from animation, release window, power and how many ui animations that she is a first for 

And honestly i think its because they kinda know this game just has its looks going for it at this point as gameplay is so stupid simple that if it didn't look good people wouldn't care anymore so they went all out with her because its all she actually has that will last, nothing she does even her global passive will last because she will be replaced by hoyo themselves soon enough"
"Once again, nope, this will not become a problem and the fearmongering is getting ridiculous"
12:20 this is why i cant take any of yall seriously 20% crit rate sure jan
Dude is still yapping for views
HSR's only value to me rn is watching my friends stream their pulls tbqh bc I haven't touched it in a minute.
6:38 - 6:43 Damn a reference from Arcane
"A friend mentioned jokingly that there won't be a 4.0 because by that point 
HSR will have throughly exhausted the following 3 points 
Players paitence for bullshit 
ideas for new characters 
Ways to balance everything"
anyone who cant clear endgame in hoyos games is a subhuman. skill issue.
"I’m sorry, but I can’t take this video seriously when your sponsor is LD Shop, a top up website for Gacha Games. This whole controversy is so wildly overblown, and I can’t help but not care anymore when so many Content Creators are trying to make it some kind of moral obligation to skip Castorice. It’s just a game: if you don’t like what’s going on, seriously just quit, and play a different game. Criticism is fine, but this topic has already been completely beaten to death, and now it’s just annoying. They added the passive, it’s in the game, it’s not going away. The best thing players can do is put their dissatisfaction in the Surveys, at this point, and hope that Hoyoverse sees the backlash from there."
"What sucks is that Castorice has a genuinely good kit design. I love the dragon animations and her playstyle is really interesting and has its own pretty intersting decision making and planning, but who's to say she will still be relevant a year from now. I still got a good amount saved for Phainon and the fate collab, and that will probably be the last chance to keep me invested in the game, especially with Endfield most likely releasing this year, a game I'm really hyped for and HSR is the game I would drop to make time to play it. 

I can see an argument that the global passive keeps her relevant even after she is powercrept, but I don't want my future characters to get reduced to a passive after a couple versions."
"This is basically the optimus prime question from transformers 

""Freedom is your right if you make that request we will honor it, but before your president decides please ask him this what if we leave and your wrong"" 

Basically no one has a problem with castorice global passive for now because everyone wants castorice but what happens when they bring out a character no one wants but they have a broken passive that you need to have or else your cooked"
Is intresting that so many ppl have different options about her i mean i pulled her and dont even noticed the passive that much and before i was doing all content without her and the op characters only with characters i got from pulls and does are what ppl say are weak i mean i use gepard and he does his job good as well bronja and houhou and mydei and he does auto battle what is fine for me i mean yes the passive is not a good idea i know but when you dont like the passive don't pull her?? I pull her bc i don't really care about the passive that much 🤔 my most run team is mydei gepard bronya and houhou what is intresting i mean i can beat most endgame content and i am free to play since i start playing honkai star rail
"-Get castorice
-Cant level cuz no material 
-Go play DU
-Best run I had
-Sustain gets one shot on final boss
-Instantly revived by castorice
-Win"
I'm still playing just because I wanted to get fugue to try boothil at his full power. I'll stop playing the game soon. I so regret spending money on this game and will never spend in a hoyo game again.
"The only way people would have naturally accepted the global passive is if it was tied to rem trailblazer rather than cast price as a unlock after beating the most recent story quest boss, would have solved the issue you noted about its availability at the very least"
Man showing Fire Emblem Heroes lol now that’s real toxic powercreep
"People seem to forget that they've been breezing through end game content with just playing Auto and not thinking. Now people are actually have to THINK how to full clear MOC. The endgame mode is designed to cater to new character, this is not something new. I've struggled with recent end game content and i racked my brain to full clear it. I do want a good challenge but this seems almost impossible. As for FUTURE global passives, i think it's best to tone it down that's not ground breaking and make it so, you can only select ONE global passive, ensuring that Castorice doesnt get the ONLY special treatment and fair for future character global passives. Gacha games are inherently predatory, this is no surprise, pull for whoever you like, not what the meta dictates. There is NO future proof characters. Hoyo does need to tone down the recent MOC as the rewards doesn't match the difficulty of the challenges. Even with new units, it is still hard to clear them. The only thing we can do as a community is to give feedback such as what I've provided earlier. Pull for whoever you like and don't let anyone judge you for doing so. Don't feel guilty for not getting the character you wanted and spend your money and pulls wisely."
"This is a turn-based game. There's only so much they can do. I expected global passives or something similar to have been came in the game...


Meta cost money. If you are unlucky just play the game again. This is a turn-based game. You can't do much anyways other than attack on your turn, wait to be attacked, activate a ultimate and have a follow-up mechanic. They need to add something else"
"I'm not even F2P, but even while occassionally spending for the charas I really like, it has been really disheartening to look at the clearance line-up of friends when I can't 3 star clear moc 11 and 12, and to then see that all the people who DID manage to do it were using whatever the latest new DPS was 

Skipping Therta, Castorice and Tribbie to go for E1S1 Mydei now means that I can't full clear MOC 12 even on attempt 6 or 7 because of course, the weaknesses on the enemies and even their special mechanics are tailored to fit the newest releases"
"She’s not really loved. She didn’t have ANY intimate interaction most of the time she was just there, but hoyo made sure she was in every scene of amphoreus. Which makes all that investment in how she fare in the Meta and the amount of animations exclusively for her"
Which makes me think she’s more of a FOMO situation than a desired character for her development
Nothing will beat HSR's launch which made over an estimated $850 million across all platforms.
"​ @Ben-sx2ed I agree, she is there mostly to look pretty. Her personality is bland to me.
and 3.2 quest is more focused on Anaxa than on her. It kinda reminds me of Firefly. Also didn't do anything memorable in quests, looked pretty, that's all. But surely characters like this sell very well, because people like pretty characters and strong characters. Character is pretty and strong = profit 
Personally I don't care about Castro, I'm pulling for Nax."
"Why do you assume they care about balance in pve gacha game?

Bruh they would sell a acheron bikini skin if they knew the simps would spend 30 dollars on it.

And I don't even want to think what they put tribbie in if they could get away with it.

Yall give big corporations way to much respect."
" @seven9 trust me the only reason they dont put bikini skins in the game is to keep the rating PG for the kids with unsupervised parent credit cards, because I guarantee if they do the skin will immediately sell more than actual characters."
Your friend is on some great copium. They pull on mobile only min 35M$ a month and on great months prob 70+M$.
"""Genshin killer"" mentality from your friend. I heard similar bullcrap arguments from people hating Genshin. You guys aren't original with ridiculous hate. But you are amusing, that you actually think that you are right."
Talking about SU. I swear like 70% of the blessings are great for Castorice. Every night buff works great on her. Running anyone (excluding Medei) during night is ass. It’s like the new SU is balanced on castorice.
​ @potatochip9514  same
​@potatochip9514 it's firefly's DU all over again
if they wanted to keep the same passive they could've have catorice give rem trailblazer a blessing or something physical in your inventory that you get after doing a certain amount of the story
Fire emblem heros makes castorices global passive look like child’s play all thing considered
"If this is the max they could do, then they should give up on this game. It's not hard for billion dollar company to make great characters. They just want quick money as soon as possible by making lazy characters like this slop"
"... dude the second half of MoC12 atm is fully weak to Imaginary, it's free for Mydei...
First half is doable with a Jing Yuan+Sunday team, or a Jade team if you have them."
" @TheJH1015  I tried Jing yuan Sunday Jade aventurine 1st half, no dice not enough damage I go down to 22 cycles or less
Acheron Team with jiaoqiu and Pela, no dice the shadow things survive
Firefly super break, no dice, shadow things survive and murder the team eventually 
Jingliu blade attempt was even sadder

Mydei can do 2nd half fast with bronya robin luocha but not 2 cycles fast"
 @TheJH1015  to me it seems Jade can only do it if she is with big herta
"This damn powercreep shilling the latest units... Without them it's impossible to clear endgame. Now let's see who's the latest unit there? Oh, Mydei?"
 @4teh4pathy  I really don't get what you're snide about here.
 @barasmin7759  mind posting UID or mydei's stat?
Mydei has a FREE 0 cycle second half I have no idea what ur on abt
"@ I'm snide about you crying about people using the ""latest units"" to clear endgame, while you yourself have a  LITERALLY latest Dps unit with a copy and a sig saying that you can't clear."
@barasmin7759 this current MoC 12 first half is not really that hard? like first off you NEED to understand how to damage the flame reaver properly. when he summons his shadows you need to kill them all at once so always always save up your ult and everything and only ever unleased everything when he summons his shadows
" @4teh4pathy  my issue is that I would have needed ALL the latest DPS. First half of MOC 12 is asking quantum or ice DMG and it needs DPS that can hit 5 enemies at once or you don't get the shadows in time. To me it looks very much like you're meant to clear with The Herta or Castorice, which I don't have and don't want. of all 100 people on my friends list, none managed to 3 star clear without The Herta or Castorice. That is my gripe here.

And for nearly all the latest PF and AS, if I can't clear and look for what others did, it shows me that all my friends who cleared did it with units I don't have, so I can go f myself for not pulling those units."
" @ItsBiox  my one aoe DPS with the right element is Jing yuan whose lightning lord does what it wants, so if the Timing is very important to break the shadows, that may be why I can't clear before it goes down to 22 cycles 🥲
I hadn't thought of that"
" @barasmin7759  yup it's alright you can retry that and take the advice in mind, I've seen too many people blame that everything in hsr is hard now because of the hp inflation but keep in mind this hp inflation only affects old enemies like svarog and the propagation bug that usually shows in MoC 12 while the newer enemies always has some type of mechanic to justify their hp increase like nikador and this recent flame reaver where both has special mechanics to kill them quickly"
I cleared by min maxing my old units. Last pull I did was Sunday
" @barasmin7759  Hey, I just want to put in my advice as well but it is going to be a bit more general since someone already helped with the Reaver fight (which I will say, does require you to only do AOE attacks when his shadows are up, NEVER when he's alone. If you need skill points, this is the best time to do basics.)

I cleared this MoC with (1st: Acheron E0S1, JQ E0S0, Pela, Fu Xuan E0S0) (2nd: Firefly E1S0, Ruan Mei E0S0, HMC (S3 DDD), Lingsha E0S0)
This was the first MoC where I was truly stuck because I didn't have the ""correct"" characters until I completed my Acheron team with JQ.

One thing I will say is that Mydei Sustainless is completely viable in this MoC. You can replace Luocha with Remembrance MC and you'll see a major difference (and I am not exaggerating). If you want the sustain, replace Robin and put her in the first half, probably replacing Jade for the classic Robin-Sunday combo.


Also, don't be afraid to look on Youtube for Jing Yuan clears especially for the Reaver because even though this game can be a character check, sometimes you have to check your stats and your gameplay first before finally saying this MoC is hard (trust me, I tried MANY teams before settling for this). See other people's Jing Yuan stats (which are shown in most videos) Sure some of them has Tribbie but Sunday-Robin can suffice.

Good luck if you haven't already completed it!"
"people yap too much about this, if it happens it happens, if you don't like it then quit, if the game dies it dies, simple"
"Can you make a video about the sad state of hunt units I just feel like the path as a whole is rendered useless when units like castorice herta anaxa mydei etc can do insane single target damage along insane aoe damage easily destroying both single target and aoe content while
Hunt units excel at one they just feel borderline useless and this is coming from a feixiao main with a extremely heavily invested FUA team"
"funny you mention rappa, even though she will definitely get the ratio treament for reruns"
"They're pretty much adding a new rarity to the game. Characters with global passives should be considered as 6* for all intent and purposes. I remember they did something similar in another gacha I played, Magia Record. They added special units that had passive skills that could affect your entire team, something never seen before. It just ruined the game completely, and eventually, you had to have all the characters with these passives if you wanted to clear the hardest content, not to mention PvP, but at least they were limited to being used WHILE they were in the party. This is just so much worse, I can imagine the state of the game in a couple years, there will be so many global passives stacking up on top of each other that your account pretty much has +80% CR, +50% ER, +40 SPD, +90% Break Efficiency, etc. And new players won't be able to clear MoC stage 2 because of how many characters you'll need to deal with the monstrous HP of everything.

This is not the end, it's the beginning of the end."
"Version 2- hell, even Version 1's rate of powercreep was already frankly absurd. Adding in a global passive is like the omen to a catastrophe. Your comment on enshittification is scarily accurate, and has represented Star Rail for the past year now. The worst is simply yet to come."
"ive played star rail since the beginning of the game. i am completely ftp. i have never been able to fully complete any game mode, and with the hp inflation and all these new broken characters i dont have the pulls for, i doubt i ever will. this game is quite literally made for whales. i quit recently. and seeing the castorice issue completely validates my idea that this game never has and never will be fully accessible to ftps"
"8:10 Ok first off, what death-immunity? They’ll all be dead on the next turn when there are zero sustain units, because it literally says if hp increases then they won’t die. So how can you run full-on DPS team like that?"
"In Honkai impact 3 there was a similar system, where you would get  a global stat increase based on if you had a certain 5 star weapon or not. However, you didn't have to pull for some of these weapons and could earn them through playing. Also their global passives were not as game changing as cheating death. Rather you would gain more HP, Atk or Crit rate."
The sad thing is that she won’t be relevant next year anyways..since they will inevitably invent a passive that will borrow a passive from another Hoyo game character probably…🤣 that is probably a next step or some shii
"People saying you still need a support/healer/shielder. I see castorice's passive as Fate Grand Order's command seals: while it is nice to have, it takes SOME of the team building/strategic aspect of the game out because you know you have a safety net if for whatever reason you fucked up or are just one turn/normal attack away from a win.
TO ME taking strategy/team building away from a turn base strategy game just makes me not interested again. I loved HSR but since the all res pen stuff and implant weakness my love for it has been in decline and THE WAY AND HOW THEY IMPLEMENTED global passives just made me quit"
Global passive BS made it to live so Hoyo isn't seeing another cent of my money
All the Standard Banner Units should be given a Global Passive.
Even if global passives are a success for Hoyo the game is really stale and boring. There's nothing to do and since endgame is just an advertisement of get a new character you're screwed
"you are a little late to the doomposting party, the passive itself its not important, it doesnt really change your gameplay, if you dont have a sustain ready you revived char is gonna die again one moment after, and those sustainless comps only work when your team is hyper invested from the get go, for example e2 s1 plus supps also similarly invested , mostly 0 cycle clears, maybe it can help if you get unlucky at the last second and all enemies decide to target tingyun at their last turn, but in any case if you are whaling like that you are already playing a different game that the rest of folk.
the precedent/slippery slope argument is fearmongering, its just a what if, what if they do something bad in the future, well if they do we can complain at that time, no need to get hysterical now.   
i woulda prefer they didnt add this passive  just so i didnt have to hear the moanings of a vocal reddit minority fueled by content creators for over a month."
You really dont need to play clips from the animated short in a video about the character's kit. Please leave it out in the future.
"Words cannot express how disappointed I am to see that people will spend money on this Character when he will singlehandedly kill the health of the game. I don't trust them to not release more Global Passive in the future. They will also probably allow enemies to one shot you because they will expect you to have Castorice. 
The powercreep is already bad and this is the last straw for some players including myself. I personally don't want to play anymore unless they fix this."
Next a global passive that adds a 5th slot for x amout of turns or some ship
I have no idea how their games have been doing revenue wise compared to the past but OH MY LORD this patch feels like they are DESPERATE for money.  It icks me massively
"I opened HSR today to be flashed with a Castorice Vid and the multipl(paid) events,lightcones and characters. They really arent even hiding the fact they want money and at this point they couldve made her banner the whole patch to milk it😮‍💨"
There is an easy solution to Castorice….. don’t pull for her 🤷🏼‍♂️
"They love the game that's why they're criticizing it, they want hsr to be better idk how hard that is to understand, they can't quit because, again they love this game, second is some of the players who also hates the global passive already spend a sht ton for this game"
​@HerrscherOfKugisaki boo hoo then
"meta shift hits hard not gonna lie, this aoe focused one is not great for hunt, but my e0s1 fei team robin, aven, topaz, all e0s0 cleared second side moc 12 in 5 cycles still, sure not as good as 0 or 1 cycle from some time ago but not terrible either."
 @ChiriKain  Its not just the meta shift its just the insane restriction to do what aoe units can easily do with less effort and especially new units with less cost.
"buddy i dont mean to be offensive but thats skill issues, im 100% f2p too and been fully clearing for a long time now."
" @ChiriKain  Gotta agree with you here. Been playing since the game came out and have only spent about $150 on the game. All of my 5 stars are E0 and I intentionally skipped some light cones to save pulls as I relied on some really good 4-star light cones. With all of that, I've still been able to clear some of the hardest content in the game. All Simulated Universes have been cleared on max threshold and have even been able to full clear MoC and AP depending on the enemies on occasion

Would I say a really good character and their light cone would have helped me clear better? Of course! But would I say they're absolutely necessary to even have a chance? I'm not willing to go that far."
@ haha no offense taken. yeah i must be doing something very wrong LOL 😭
"I think it depends on how you play the game. For casual players, those who don't care about end games and only play for the story and characters, HSR is still F2P friendly."
@ that’s fair that’s fair. i’m a casual player but i want to be able to clear the content 😭
"it's not even game changing, if you were already clearing endgame content then you probably don't even need it, if you were running sustainless, they'll die almost immediately again anyway, and if you were running a sustain, with how strong enemies are now, if your characters do die, they'll probably die again even if they get revived

it's occasionally helpful in specific circumstances, I would rather take increased stats that's always helpful than the revive"
You can turn it on and off tho
Only if they provide a way to get all of them guaranteed
when those 3 old limited characters didnt even go into the standard banner and the only way to get them is to lose 50/50 is crazy to me. not to mention their LC
SVAROG JUMPING IN FROM THE SKY THE MOMENT AN ENEMY HITS AN UNDERAGED CHARACTER
They are buffing the old char right? Still haven’t heard any details might have to wait till 4.0 for them final passive buff
​ @tristanwalhain8601  LMAOO I WANT THAT SO BAD
Yanqing has already a global passive which is being annoying
​ @YellowLeaf-lc6  I don't think they can legally add them to standard banner. Has to do with how the marketing works.
You clearly missed the point of the video to type this and neglect the real issue
 @vectory674  you clearly didnt read what i wrote cause i mentioned that what ifs and precedents arguments are bs.
"@ChiriKain  What Vars doesn't know is that this is a Hoyoverse blueprint. Honkai Impact did it, Genshin did it with Natlan characters. Global Passive is a problem because supporting this will help them go further in the predatory practice they created. Being pessimistic and fearmongering is not the same thing at all. This is an issue right now"
 @vectory674  Genshin has global passives. Remember Raiden with her global passive where it took less mora to upgrade polearms and swords 😱
Oh 100% I expect them to massively increase the damage output of enemies now.
Good riddance?
 @_TheStormThatIsApproaching  they already did after Aventurine got released. Some bosses will technically one shot you unless you have a ton of HP so you are forced to use a shield
 @xenosaber77  stay in your game then. I don't need your opinion
 @vectory674  Good thing I don't even consider any of your opinion valid
@ yet you're here. Getting pissed at his opinion. Funny isn't it.
" @_TheStormThatIsApproaching  who said I'm pissed? Holy projection, Batman!"
"@ That's ironic... Y'all ""good riddance"" nerds are just so easy to read. lmao
Y'all be watching videos criticizing your gacha game and scrolling through the comments to search for a reason to get pissed at something.

But keep acting tuff if that makes you feel any better."
@_TheStormThatIsApproaching  Nice projection. Have a nice life (it's not wrong to say 'good riddance' is it?)
"@ Yeah... and as expected, you've got nothing interesting to say.
Just wasting people's time. Later gator!"
 @_TheStormThatIsApproaching  answer then
"Welcome to gacha games. 

Nintendo wants to say hello as well."
"Doesn't seem desperate, more like they realize how excited people are and want to take advantage of it"
"Hoyoverse games are still doing miles ahead of wuwa. And as of today, HSR topped the chart of multiple asia regions - china, SEA, Korea and Japan (seen from a video i saw in CN community) and cn community doesnt really care that much about global passive."
"⁠ @WizzyTheDizzy  how is wuwa even relevant to the current conversation? No one here mentioned it. 

If it was relevant, wuwa’s revenue is almost always guaranteed to be on the lower side due to its gacha model."
 @WizzyTheDizzy  Are you happy star rail is earning much money after having anniversary spending event and a whale shop? Are you a whale? Do you want more of this?
" @eszterfodor1136  no, but this is hoyoverse we are talking about. If they earn a lot, no pushback from cn community, you can rest assured they are not going to change. There is nothing we can do."
"They have been topping the charts for over a year, thats why they're this greedy, they know they can get away with it"
"The fact 80% of the anniversary rewards are behind a major paywall




Like noy even low spenders get anything worth while, its purely a whale only event🤦‍♀️"
I didnt know it was this bad lmao
"@Accountthatexists 80% is the number you pulled out of your ass and there is no other explanation. 
Like, I hate the spending event myself, but the only items of value are the 5* shop thing (which is literally whale targeted system to begin with) the rest is a giant nothingburger. Also, it’s literally just one event on the side, it’s not even listed (i think) unless you open a shop. XD Doesn’t change it suck, but wow, a spending event have a pop up icon when you open shop. Crazy.

Anyway, what F2P players like the most? Pulls. Guess what isn’t paywalled, wow, you guessed it- all the currency and pull.

My point is- if you hate something, at least do it with a proper argumentation and not rage over imaginary problem that you, quite literally, just made up. Lol"
"Just swipe your card. 
simple 
You want it hard, you pay for it."
"@ Nah, that would make too much sense lmao"
 @TshegofatsoSekololo  guys good news. I got castorice E0S2 at around 150 pulls. So yeah. Good game
 @Kurisu139  Congrats
@TshegofatsoSekololo  I literally just download it again after a year. Guess I'd be here in a while
The game is just an ad for Castorice.
" @eszterfodor1136  In fairness, the entire game is just an ad for its characters just by the nature of gacha games."
"​ @Tani26 ""proper argumentation"" bro hea just talking about how little you get from the anni event, what do you want him to do, make a scientific study on why the rewards feel bad 😂"
"@ Ah ye, my bad that if you don’t get free C6 5* and 200 pulls, it feels bad. My fucking bad. XD 

No1 complained about previous anniversary rewards, people were even happy, mocking how „Genshin could never”. The rewards are fine, nothing major changed compared to last time, you just have unrealistic expectations for what they should be at the end*. If you’re so butthurt by it, just quit the game cause it’s clearly not for you if you expect to get, literally everything for you and anything you get is never enough.


*Reminder you willingly play F2P >gatcha< game that makes company money by spending money in it. So again, expecting company to give you everything for free „cUz iT’s AnnIvErSAry” is quite literally, setting yourself for dissapointment. lol
Point is- could They do more? Ye. Was it realistic? No. And even if they did get you 10/20 more free pulls, you fuckers would be here complaining anyway just cause it’s nof free Castorice."
"I was looking forward to getting some free stuff, playing a fun event and reading the story and pulling for Anaxa, not getting told to pay for stuff to get xyz free thing that probably isn't even a good deal. I'm f2p!!!"
They're essentially putting paywalls on stat boosts
"i recently started playing this game with the knowledge that it is powercreep central, so im not bothered by anything they do
but i get its frustrating for people who started early on and had any level of trust or higher expectations, probably feels like they were mislead and spent money on a false premise or something"
"7:42 this is straight up delirium. if you know even a single thing about hsr endgame, this will not affect ""efficiency"", only QUALITY OF LIFE. so you don't have to make 10 runs, only 5. it will NEVER replace a sustain and if you think so, you are delusional."
"Congratulations to Hoyo because THIS thing is what made me stop spending on HSR, and this says a lot because I'm a huge HI3 Flame chaser fan."
People who dont like the global passive should just quit and stop complaining
"I think that spending event, it's the devs just telling us that this is not a casual-friendly game. It's for whales, and that's it."
"i find this just a bit sad. i haven't been keeping up with star rail but the story and the turn based combat is something that i have been feeling like returning to. and when i want to return i start hearing about global buffs hidden behind pay walls, making the game even less accessible to a free to play player like me. my teams are already super dated and even if some characters i have get buffed i just feel like i couldn't keep up. so when i already had problems in penaconi with my teams then i just don't think it's worth the effort to get back into it. honestly really sad since i was really enjoying the story when i was playing."
"20% crit is a horrible example. Think more in line of HI3 it would probably be 5% atk or hp. It's not good, but HI3 has been this way with even worse powercreep for years. This is a Honkai game, after all."
"What I find mildly hilarious about the global passive is that it also just doesn’t work out in your favor sometimes/just doesn’t matter.

Practically all relevant enemies do more than one action during their turn anyway, be it FuA or just flat out doing more damaging actions in a turn, that even if a team member dies and gets revived, they’ll still be killed anyway because you have no way to survive or even interact with multiple attacks like that, and you just end up dying anyway.  I know this cause it happened when I tried MoC after getting Castorice.  Things just attack way to much and way too hard now that it’s become an arms race of scaling damage, mechanics, and overall bloat to the game where there’re just way too many things to keep track of and surviving this shit is just too much to ask sometimes."
"unfortunately castorice is going to easily make over 100 million between the top up reset, the spending event, insane character animations, global passive, and the general excitement for anniversary patches. 
shareholders are going to see that and say... yeah you need to do that again. regardless if it's bad for the game's health the sales are the only thing that matters. and they made certain it was going to be a crazy revenue spike."
"My true problem with global passives is not only the problems it can give to Hsr, but also to the gacha industry as a whole. 

We all know that modern gacha games tend to have some mayor inspiration from Hoyoverse as a whole. For both the better and the worse. So if they see this passive being successful, we may see it in other games.

Kuro games is a great example. Since their very beginning they have been taking some heavy notes from Hoyo as a whole. What will happend to Wuwa once they implement global passives? Or worse: their future Hsr version.

You can also come to the argument that that won't be the case because ""Kuro is Hoyo but better, so that won't happen"" argument, and i won't debate whenever or not that's true because that's not the point. Point is: What will happen to other gacha games that look at this? Ananta, Neverness to Everness, Black Beacon, Azur Promilia...

My only hope is that future gacha devs will either see this and not try it or that the Chinese government puts some sort of law that prohibits this kind of passives. And before you say anything, yes, i'm inhaling copium for this."
"I always suspected star rail COULD go this way.

Because most gacha games do sth to a similar vein. Create an exclusive skill/passive or just make the char a must pull anchor by making them ridiculously op,.

Its such a major problem bcz its a HOYO GAME."
why you promoting dangerous site like LD shop are they associated with hoyo? if not thats asking for potential bans
"The rate of HSR's powercreep is scaring me, while yes I have a job and could top up for the new units hoyo keeps on releasing every new patch. That does not sound like a good financial decision, since that would imply that every month or other month I have to spend."
Pulled castorice and lc hope will get e2 until end of banner
The only reason I reinstalled the game is because Castorice has a dragon. I swear thats the only reason. And I am really pissed off. I fucking love dragons so much and the moment they decide to add a dragon they also decide to shit on the game. I just cant believe how fucking unlucky I am. Thankfully Wuwa does have my back with Jinshi and I trust Kuro would never make something like this with their current track record. But still even Jué is an eastern style dragon not the more cooler looking western style dragon. Bro I am really mad right now This comment cant do my anger justice.
"I really don't think it's a big deal, It only matters to min maxers. If you just only go for the chars that u like then there won't be a difference"
I think they're gonna follow the Hi3rd Divine Key road with this one and if thats as far as they're going it's honestly pretty negligeable especially since a lot of Divine Keys are Free so it's probably not as big of a deal as it seems
"Let's not ignore the fact that Castorice poaches the entire F2P break engine for her only F2P team. Meaning Cas players not only need her and her LC, but also a team of upcoming 5* supports to free up their break teams again."
I don't really trust them not to add an actually useful global passive after seeing this new spending event
yes we all acknowledge that powercreep in a gacha game is somewhat normal but the speed that they drop those powercreep is way too fast and too sudden to the point that u barely keep up with it.
"Not really a false premise, a majority of the players are just greedy and stupid and pull for every new shiny character instead of planning their pulls."
Doing something with 2 times less attempts is literally an efficiency gain
 @luucx7  no it's not. and efficiency gain is when you clear 1 cycle faster. when you clear in same amount of cycles but use less of your time it doesn't make the result anymore effective from gameplay perspective.
same i used to like the game and buy BP every patch but after 3.0. damn
Welcome to gacha games ma'am.
Speak for yourself.
" @Grayewicked notice how the op used the word “I, I’m, Me” yeah because they were speaking for themselves….use your brain"
​ @Grayewicked  Wisdom chases you but you are faster.
"@ I'm not gonna sit here as if people haven't been having this DISGUSTING activistic undertone on their comments but sure, you do you."
 @Grayewicked what are you talking about? There is no undertone in op’s comment. All I pointed out was that the op was OBVIOUSLY speaking from their PERSONAL experience…..
" @phycyo1790  Sure, every anecdote is a ""personal experience"", until the community starts mobbing.

I mean, just look at all y'all currently."
@Grayewicked  Oooh here comes the white Knight defending the billion dollar company. Did that make you feel good? Do you want a cookie? Or perhaps 3 pulls?
"It made me quit after almost 2 years of playing, and I was not even f2p."
@emmasmith9785  where have I actively defended Hoyo?
 @emmasmith9785  where have I actively defended Hoyo? I haven't.
if you are really playing Hi3 you know they have the worst powercreep and they also hhave spending event. You are weak and no idea what Hi3 is.
"@Grayewicked  I was speaking on Hoyo, and you just jumped. So either you're being a white knight, or you're just delusional. Either way, I'm not interested in those brownie points you're desperate to get."
"@emmasmith9785  hey, I'm saving y'all from yourselves, enlightening you with another solution, which is mindfulness, but I'm not a bald person forcing my ideology on others. Y'all can go gang up on me, like a 5v1 on a podcast, and that's understandable and to be expected."
 @Grayewicked  No one asked lil bro.
"@emmasmith9785  right, and no one cares about your rallies, spawn of gachaslop and kektone."
 @Grayewicked bro are you schizo 😭😭
​ @Grayewicked haha hoyo defender
"omg really? they didnt invest millions creating a game for people to play it for free? oh wow, thats shocking."
" @ChiriKain  it's almost like the game earns like 20-30 MILLION dollars a MONTH, stop being an idiot please."
"​ @ChiriKain The multibillion-dollar company isn't going to date you bro, stop making excuses for greed"
"​​ @ChiriKain Kid, I say this as a business owner, even if only small. While yes, you run a business for profit, not for charity, it's still reasonable and positive to respect and value your customer. You shouldn't treat your customers badly, and while giving preferential treatment to VIPs is almost mandatory, that doesn't mean you should then treat your minor customers badly.

And it's a fact that F2P are customers for the game called HSR, just as much as whales and dolphins. Even tough F2P don't invest monkey directly, they invest time in the game that impacts positively in player activity stadistics, as well as they make free publicity and community, both necessary for live-service games.

So HoYo isn't entitled to implement bad directives for the game's development just because it's, allegedly, more redituable. It's bad for all their players, not just the F2P. And I would dare say it's also Bad for business in the long run, even though most greedy blockheads will say that it makes bigger numbers NOW, as those numbers likely come at the cost of customer's trust and goodwill."
The token that u get after E6 someone already said a lots
I mean you get 77 pulls as f2p in 20 days thats a free 5* go to another game and check how much you ger there 😂. It still gives more pulls then most other games. Just saying
"@ u forgot wuwa just gave out 2 free 5 stars at the start plus the 60 plus -ish pull. Then they proceed to gave out another limited 5 star at patch 1.2 or sth. Yeah hsr gave more pull than other games, Righhhhhht, not to mention a free 5 star weapon too ohhhh wait there's more weapon banners are guarantee."
"​ @GGThaLock 77 pulls in 20 days? You sure about that? Last I checked, I only got around 50-ish as an active F2P. Unless you’ve been hoarding since previous patches, please show us the math kind sir"
"​​ @trebull2284  NOT to be a kurobot but while you're generally right i wanna make a couple of corrections
Kuro has a precedent of treating players well since pgr, which came out half a decade or so ago
Kuro is also NOT a big company. They have seen relative success since Wuwa but make no mistake, they were NOWHERE near mihoyo in terms of how wealthy, expansive and successful they were until wuwa- and even then hoyo has nearly successfully monopolized the gacha market. You're acting like these two companies are equivalent, when one is incredibly rich and the other has only just begun to see success. Please bffr"
"Even though Genshin is stingy and has a lot of flaws,I respect them for not giving power creep as horrible as this.Genshin is more casual friendly than Honkai because at least the characters from 4 years ago are still usable.HSR is more for whales if players want to experience the game fully.I hope what they did to HSR in term of powercreep will not effect Genshin and Zenless Zone Zero in the future"
I feel like the game is still extremely free to play friendly. But just very gacha dependent if you want to full clear everything. It's a fun casual game if you don't care about all of that.
 @hido...  Are you kidding? It's a very f2p friendly game if you don't care about anything to do with endgame.... In 3.0 and 3.1 the game barely had any events just the usual endgame reset and simulated universe! How can you say it's f2p friendly when you can only pull 1 character ( and not even sure it's going to be the limited) / version?! Sure if you don't want limited characters or endgame... you can watch the story on youtube at this point!
@eszterfodor1136  dawg I got no idea what you're even on about. I haven't even played the story since Penacony started. I just do everything else and find it fun. One character per version I find generous. I've played a ton of shitty and genuinely predatory gacha games in the past so maybe my expectations aren't high for gacha games.
"If you want to play a turn based game, go play a real JRPG, not this coomer slop."
"@ JRPGs aren't as convenient. Story based games you have to sit down and actually play. A mobile game like HSR, you can get on do some grinding to level characters, or hard content at any convenient time."
"I've seen so many people saying it'll be egregious like a 50% def ignore or yeah that 20% crit rate, but from what we've seen with a revive, it'll be something small and hardly noticeable. More in line with what you said (I was thinking 10% atk or hp lol). Not to mention I think the frequency of this implementation will probably be relatively far and few between based on character importance and popularity. They gave the most popular character almost everyone was pulling for anyway the global passive. Someone similar to her would likely get the next."
"If you're running a no-sustain team, as Vars posits here, you can't heal unless your healing is provided by SU blessing or a light cone or something, therefore your affected units would die after taking action..."
 @angeldiaz762 that’s why he literally said edge out an extra turn. He didn’t say the global passive is going to give 10 fucking extra cycles
"funny how most of that revenue can barely be attributed to the global passive... but they'll spin the story saying ""oh the GP sells"""
"Thats what irks me about this so much. They added this controversial passive to an anticipated character. Of course people will pull for her when she's a belovwd character, or a character that obviously has an appealing concept (summoning a big fuck you dragon) even if she isnt meta. This will artificially inflate the sales to even those who arent meta slaves. I just hate how they handled her, that it makes someone conflicted on pulling for her."
It's kinda sad how the anniversary is completely overshadowed by spending events and top up deals.
" @ogmechsftw  That's what makes the global passive so stupid, simply she doesn't need it to sell, she has a nice design, godly animations and uniqueness"
all the new tabs and event pages looks like a casino :/
" @nat6lbg440  to be fair, there's not a lot in the anniversary anyway so..."
 @TheJH1015 I’m waiting for more events cause I’m confusion
"not sure what you mean by shareholders, Hoyo has always been a private company. I agree with everything else in your comment though"
"This is unfortunately very much true. However as nihilistic as sounds that they will just global passive the game to death if we as a fanbase that CARES for the longevity of the game go to the feedback page and flood their systems with disapproval.

Yes they'll listen to the numbers that she sold MILLIONS. Because she will sell. But if you wish to see this game last well into 10 years do NOT spend on her banner NOW and instead not spend all of anniversary or spend it all on Anaxagoras or the rerun banners on top of the feedback. It is the ONLY way that even something remotely will be moved at all because casuals will NOT give a shit."
 @TheJH1015  yeah like a dead anniversary xD
"and they gonna do it again, and again, and again, and again. They will sell global passive and mock people who like certain character, play certain playstyle and invest on it."
"Yeah I am part of the problem unfortunately, this passive is a terrible idea and precedent, but all the sales are too juicy and useful for me not to use, cause I want pretty much every upcoming character 
Thank god tho they are ACTUALLY buffing units and ALSO moved old units into the pity pool AND gave a free Ruan mei so frankly the scales have completely balanced out (imagine the other game doing half of this 💀💀💀🤣🤣)"
" @LizardKingRequiem  u forgot that the buffing units arent out yet and the scale has not balanced yet, the way they do this is not a permanent solution instead it just a bandage to a peace the players, hiding the bad shit that they about to do next in the future."
​@neokatwastaken I was scrolling & hoping to see someone mention this!
"Mihoyo doesnt have a single shareholders, they are a private company... More than 80% of their revenue goes to the 3 chinese founders including dawei and cao haiyu (the most problematic one). The remaining shares is split between ppl who invested in them in the beginning including sky mobbi which is part of Hangzhou miyi"
"Mindless consumerism won the day again.
""My wallet my choice and people be doomed."""
eah this game is beyond cooked
I doubt it will make 100 million. Many players already quit and the Castorice trailer which acts as the main advertisement for an anniversary character is lacking enough views compared to other hyped characters on their day 1.
 @nat6lbg440  first time seeing a spending event on a gacha game you twit?
Yup I already maxed out the top up. Might as well since I'ma spend it anyways. Might as well get more for my money.
​ @Cantarella-Fisalia lol must be your first gacha game. Don't look at nikke XD
 @voledae  The worst thing is Hoyoverse is going to see Castorice make a lot of money because of the top-up and how hard they were shilling her and executives are going to see the sales and interpret as people wanting more global passives
We getting top up reset which day ?
Hoyo is a private company. There are no public shareholders.
"She even have a unique animation when you enter the game first time after the update, even the previous anniversary main DPS Acheron don't have such treatment. The devs def want to go all in for the revenues from this banner (Top-up reset+spending events)."
someone already bought 88 COPIES of her. we are so cooked.
" @nat6lbg440  the anniversary is shit without the ads. A story quest, two events, an anniversary event that's time gated"
" @neokatwastaken  no really, hoyo is own by tencent"
"It depends on the conversion rate. Some people buy the currency but don’t spend it on the banner they spend at. Conversion rate will be low. Hyv not a new company, they should be able to track that."
 @diluc-s7f  it's already at 20 mil +
"i played since day 1, ill just quit if they continue."
"Im glad is the case, she is awesome, and 3.2 patch ha sbeing relly good"
Hoyo is a private company
I think you meant to say over 400 million
Damn you were right HSR made over $100M from iOS & Android alone!
"Please, don't spend. Spending money to pull for meta is a rabbit hole, and if You fall in it you won't be able to get out until it's taking too much of a toll in your pouch. Some pitiful souls don't ever get out of it. If you feel like spending to support a game you like and feel is worth it, it's your decision, but spending responsably should come first, and never because the game it's leading you there with powercreep as that's a sign of a negative game."
"@oscargutierrez3206 not saying I'd whale or spend money, only time I'll ever do that is if I really like a certain character or characters. Then I would E6S5 them. Besides I already have a list on who I want to pull anyway."
i thought that E2 archeron was enough. Because even though there is powercreep in the game i didnt think its gonna be this fast at least let my E2 archeron last for another year or 2.
" @jaya0177  Well, that's fine. Please, don't take it as me telling you how to spend your money, I just wanted to prevent someone to naively begin spending in gacha meta."
 @oscargutierrez3206  yeah I know that money should be spent wisely.
"Never. Top. Up those are 3 words I live by in gachas. The $5 pass is pretty innocuous and high value, so I normally go for that but even that is in question now with the extreme greed on display. Seriously considering going f2p when my current pass runs out and if the game becomes too hard or unfun for f2p in the future it might be time to move on."
"Same, I take months off, usually works out when the guys banners are up. Turned off Reddit/YouTube leaks and news

Working on learning German and working out, things I don't need a roulette wheel for..or the classic steam backlog

Good luck 07"
"Fucking same, literally just the dragon. If it wasn't for the dragon Castorice could've been an easy skip for me. Such a missed opportunity of a potentially interesting thematic of character as a whole."
For Global passives as a concept or for just this one in particular
" @grimsdol4665  as a concept, to me if i don’t like a characters design/lore/whatever i won’t get them, i didn’t get tribbie for example, even when i knew i was gonna get castorice. Ppl are too focused on ”endgame” in a single player game and if you just get the chars u want and have fun playing the story/whatever."
@blehbeh3717  well they're focused on the endgame cuz that's all the content outside of story and ig exploring but that's meh. and it's where we get a good chunk of jades from. so it still is an important part of the game
"@ ofc i understand, but it’s not realistic to think that ur gonna clear the hardest content in a p2w game every patch otherwise why would whales spend money, so why even focus on that to begin with, just clear the content build ur chars and play an event or 2 then swap games, gacha games aren’t made to be played like a ”normal” game anyway"
"@blehbeh3717  It is and it should be, there's a reason why gacha games rightfully get called trash and it's because of things like that.

reason why Genshin was such a massive success was because it made sure that never happens. it doesn't matter how good your graphics or gameplay is if people constantly feel the need to use the hot new thing in order to enjoy parts of the game. 

and if hoyo wanted players to spend more then they should improve their character is more, either through stroy, fun, or marketing.

people don't whale in these games because of META reasons. it's purely because they like the character that much"
"@ No that's not true, I've known many people that did not care for characters and only pulled for ''meta''. To build the ''strongest team'' so to say. 

And u say that it should be, but it isn't. There is patches that bring new content, u play the patch and then quit or you login every day until the next content drops. That's gacha games at it's core. If you want a game that u can play 24/7 that's not gacha games and people need to understand that. 

Hoyo also doesn't care that much, because people keep buying their characters no matter what anyway. Look at pokemon for example. They have huge numbers even though the games are laggy/bad graphics, hoyo is in the same boat because there isn't a lot of competition. This has gotten better ofc bcs of wuwa etc. But not perfect yet."
"@blehbeh3717  people who care about the META are in the minority, and people who pull purely based off of META are an even smaller minority.

The only time the wider community cares about META is when it becomes a problem that effects their gameplay experience like powercreep or a character being too powerful otherwise they just pull for the characters they like.

and those players should still be able to enjoy the entire game without having to be META slave

and adding things like Global passives makes that harder and harder to do each time a new passive gets added"
" @grimsdol4665  No u are again thinking a gacha game is like a normal game, it's not and ppl need to stop fooling themselves bcs of it.

Gacha games WILL be harder to beat, esp ''end game content/modes'' if you do not pull for ''objectivly'' good characters, that's why there is challenge accounts to begin with (4star only, f2p only etc)

I'm not saying global passives are good, I'm saying they simply do not affect me and probably a majority of the fanbase that doesn't even clear/touch moc for example. And that at the end of the day we should just pull for the chars we want bcs they make us play the game, and if we can't clear content the highest tiers of end game content bcs of that then that's fine with me. Whales will have incentive to pull and ''look cool'' and the game will keep going steadily."
"@blehbeh3717  Why not think a gacha game, especially a hoyo game, is like other games. People who actively try not to have 2 things be compared to each other are people being disingenuous.

HSR and Gacha games as whole are still games, and they should be fun and fair. Making it so you need you can't use the characters you want and instead have to use your precious money or pulls on the best characters whether you like them or not isn't fun.

and if your answer is that's how Gacha games are then guess what. those games are trash, they're not good games. 

the reason why Genshin and hoyoverse as whole was such a massive success is because it made sure not to fall into the same pitfalls as other Gachas"
" @grimsdol4665  Sure you are right to a certain extent, however at the end of the day hoyo games are still gacha games, and no matter how fair they still use the same practices, denying that and saying ''they are still games they should be fun and fair'' is like turning a blind eye towards how gacha games function. They profit off of fomo, and they do anything to make you spend money, this is why moc changes favorably towards newer characters, and is why we have different ''meta'' over the span of years. Esp with star rail you notice this with powercreep, and now ofc global cooldowns. 

Genshin and star rail and zzz operate the same way, Daily login, weeklies, different in game quests, events etc. These games are not comparable to for example monster hunter world, where you buy the game/expansion and then are able to grind and complete everything within the game without having to spend more money on armor/weapons which is their equivulant of chars i suppose. 

Gacha games are free, and they need to earn money too, free games usually have skins (fortnite cod etc) and gacha games have characters (also sometimes skins) 

My answer to ''why not a gacha games'' is that. They are free and need to make money, they earn their majority money from whales, this is a known fact with gacha games, and that means they will always need to give whales that ''powerful'' feeling, hence the moc catering to newer characters = harder content for f2p/low spenders. It's how these games work, and that's why i don't even try to compete with them, i just have fun with the characters i want and plan accordingly every patch. 

I also have 2 accounts, so i am able to get the characters i want, gacha games give you the illusion u can play for free, by having to invest a huge amount of time, because time = money and time invested = more incentive to spend money. You should not forget that all games, but ESPECIALLY gacha games, are made to make money."
"@blehbeh3717  There's always an acceptable limit and it's important to create one. the argument that they have to make money can be used to excuse any scummy way of marketing or monetization.

hey why is this is this game $300? well they gotta make money somehow 🤷"
"@  yes but that is gacha games at it’s core, yes ofc game prices need to be realistic, but gacha games specifically reward whales by having better characters when they spend money, thats their whole business model, and why the game is free and why they give more free pulls towards the beginning of the game, it’s a known tactic to get you hooked. Thats why i keep saying gacha games are different and why when we play them we should keep that in mind."
@blehbeh3717  HSR has hundreds of millions of dollars in budget and makes just as much. it does not need to do this in order to keep afloat. and idk any whales who aren't selfish idiots who asked for global passives on 5 star characters
"@  they didn’t ask for it but it doesn’t bother them because they will always get them anyway. Also they earn way more than they spend, thats just normal business practice that every company does. Again gacha games just work like this no matter the company the sooner you realize that the sooner u can start planning and have fun on ur own terms"
@blehbeh3717  Global Passives on limited characters are not the norm in Gachas and being complacent with yummy practices that don't improve the game in anyway is how games die
" @grimsdol4665  They might not be the norm but that doesn't change how gachas work, if anything they are trying to create more fomo for more money. Yes i agree it's how games die, and the game might lose players for that. 

I don't think i would have introduced a global passive if i was in charge, and i don't think it's a good decision. However it does not affect me, because i am not a whale, and i am not clearing all of the hardest content every patch anyway. If the story/events however start to become too hard to the point where u have to rely on new characters to clear it THEN i think it will have gone too far."
"@blehbeh3717  How is the game losing players not harmful to you? If the game had less players then that means less content will be made because there's not enough players and income to sustain it. 

even if all the players who leave are F2P that's still bad as a big budget game with a low population is still bad, and whales aren't going to spend on a game that has less and less players and content."
i think its to early to judge how powerful the become in the future this one was for testing the waters with players how they react to it and how good she will sell the next global passive that comes is pretty much the make or break part ive it staiys at this smaller power scale then will its still shit you dont brick your acccount ive you dont pull that charakter but ive they decide to put stats or action advance on it then it becommes an even bigger problem
"Thing is, the Divine Keys change the characters playstyles, not affect the whole account like a global passive."
yeah she not only steals FF's role in 3.0 but also snags all of FF's F2P team with free Ruan Mei being her 2nd best harmony behind Tribbie
Insane how in a build guide I found of castorice that the free and semi free remembrance light are not her second best option it's any OTHER 5 star lightcone that has high base hp that's her second best.
Only BP LC works on her.. I straight up have Bailu's LC for the HP
"That seems like a plus side because it'll make her way more accessible for f2p players, unlike Aglaea who required a lot of investment to perform at her peak"
"@ i was prepared to use that if i didn't get her sig as well. despite this, I still cannot 3 star floor 12 because my only 2 competitive teams are break and Cas, which are held together with paperclips at this point."
"Yes she shares supports that’s been done forever, back in 1.6 EVERYONE wanted ruan mei"
@tfemrobin  Exactly 💯
Whats wrong with rewarding the people that actively fund the game
" @tfemrobin  it's not wrong, but the way it's done seems kinda... I mean, I  the retroactive pull reward thing is alright, but the reward giveaway for spending money is a pretty twisted way of rewarding spenders, for me at least..."
 @tfemrobin  it's not a celebration for the players then. no way you're defending this greedy ass shit when it's an anniversary for the PLAYERS that keep the game running
 @tfemrobin ”reward” 😬
 @tfemrobin  because those people literally fund game decisions that could screw everyone else over especially f2p. Yeah the group of people YALLL NEVER CONSIDER
" @tfemrobin  you have major brainrot, please speak with people outside of the gatcha bubble"
"10:00 heavily disagree, a global passive granting ANY sort of combat advantage is SEVERAL times more staggering than the slight off chance that Castorice’s revive granting your Aglaea one extra turn earning you a 3* clear. While GP’s are bad for sure, Castorice’s GP in specific is not strong at all

Like, even a +2% crit damage global passive is way worse than what Castorice has"
"Everyone complaining:

Me who pulled Castorice: Homer hiding in the bushe"
Meow..
They could make it so that you can only have one global pasive at a time. That way they can release a free character with one. It wouldn't solve the issue completely but it would be better.
"Are we seriously still on about this? Here's a stunt: I'm going to not watch the video and see if I can still nail the content. Let me know how I did.

Part 1: Castorice and her global passive are briefly introduced.
Part 2: An explanation of what a global passive is.
Part 3: The potential pitfalls of global passives long term.
Part 4: Agonized hand-wringing over whether or not we 'trust' Hoyo to not monetize a mechanic (Spoiler Alert: We Don't)
Part 5: The rather odd assertion that the players who aren't quitting right now are too stupid to understand any of the above points.
Part 6: Defensive dismissal of possible counterarguments.
Part 7: The disingenuous argument that any nice thing introduced to HSR from now on is part of a cynical effort to 'distract' the fans rather than 'address the underlying issues.'
Part 8: Connect to the wider power creep issue. Avoid, at all costs, explaining how these issues aren't baked into the gacha format.
Part 9: Wrap up by asking for engagement  in the comments.

I've been seeing this video in some form or another for months and they all - every last one of them - follow this pattern."
Doesn't the passive require a sustain? I know Castorice can heal in some way but not that quickly so even if she has that passive you still need a healer or a shielder to not lose that second life
whoever idea that is they should be fired immediately
"Global passives better be locked to major releases if they want the game to still be at least f2p friendly. ATP castorice is acheron v2 and I definitely don't want to get her in terms of a gameplay perspective. The real issue here is that instead of skipping out of damage (Acheron), you're skipping out on a passive that extends outside of a character basically. It's an account buff :face-purple-crying:"
"On top of the entire controversy and major power scaling issue, just like Mauvika, I want to play the character, not a bike or a dragon. I don’t understand their design focus and thank goodness she doesn’t appeal to me so it’s an easy skip whereas I understand how so many are tempted by the supposed META

With how they are continuing, it’s killed any interest in continuing to invest as it’s proven it makes dedication pointless or quickly overcome basically in a few patches. Hope they’ll redirect and correct before they continue going down this path too long"
Free to play dying
Not HoYo shoving a unique Castorice animation at the Login screen YIKES
They already brainwashed the players by giving a free 5 star and 30 pulls whats stopping them from adding more global passives? The hsr player base ain't doing shit😭 not to mention when tf are we getting a 4 star 😢
Himeko: the next stop is... Powercreep 🗣️🔥🔥🔥
"This is hilarious, I actually started day 1, then quit shortly after pulling and building HuoHuo? I just got fed up and extremely bored with how limited this turn based game is.

Instead of making this account wide buff, a free unlock through story and in the future potentially adding more account wide unlocks which add more depth to your favourite two button autoplay masher, they put it into a limited character's kit. Chef's kiss"
Wuwa dying video when
"I would agree, that chars power did spike alot, but most of them are restricted aswell.
Like Herta and Archeron needing certain chars to function well. The same kinda with Castorice, might need more than one healing unit. 
Older DPS like Blade, Yunli etc aren't that restriced.

I don't really understand the fuss about her passive though.
 While its funny that, that powerceps Bailu's completly, its for most content not that usefull anyway.
I do think this will be special for her aswell, since shes kinda death incarnet...
I really don't think were gonna see that often, and when it won't be direct damage or stat boosts."
"Castorice's Global Passive: I can revive you 
Some Players: Brother Ew"
"As a Guardian Tales enjoyer, Castorice's Global Passive is a joke compared to 300% Global Stats buff (PvP gacha btw)."
"how bad Global passive is entirely dependent on how much faith you have in Hoyo balancing Global passives. if all passives are practically pointless and have a set limit then the game will live

but if you're like me you have no faith in hoyo and fully expect them to powercreep Global passives and make them a must have or struggle and have linit on how many can be active"
All Amphoreus characters have basically been S tier so far... I have 0 doubt that the next characters are gonna be the same... PowerCreep Rail is real..
"This! It would reduce the fomo, and will have people consider if one passive is better for a team over another, rather than 'new global passive, will buff my characters, need to pull'"
Or none
or have it only active while fighting in amphoreus/during the amphoreus act as like a thing for the story idk
and you know damn well they would NEVER do that....
"No. Just make the global passives freely farmable. The problem aren’t the passives, but that they’re completely locked behind limited units. This wouldn’t be a problem if powercreep wasn’t as blatantly bad as this. Newer enemies are always balanced around newer units. What makes you think they won’t be balanced around requiring global passives also?"
"That doesn't solve anything, maybe just don't release characters with global a passive in the first place"
2 commenter above doesn't read OP properly
I'm gonna reply this comment because of Seth. Thank you fellow silver Knight.
"yeah surely HOYO will do that, thats just copium honestly"
Honestly just remove the global aspect of the revive and make it so that she can prevent a fatal attack once per battle in her current team. It's that simple.
" @johnarcenas883  Chinese law can allow that, so yeah, cooked"
" @justamoogle5268  They can't backtrack. They can't just nerf castorice and because they will do more in the future, at least limit them to one por team"
 @LegatusFall  best knight in fe8. My homies hate Orson
"thats exactly what im saying, it would still keep the economic gambling perception as always and not break the games meta - people dont have to pull all the characters they can just save for a passive they want to have. And even so i dont think this passive is going to be a consistent thing jsut something every once in a while like anniversaries."
" @nicholasrodriguez1139  no. I think the game having new mechanics is good (increases diversity of gameplay and generates more revenue for characters), cause at the end of the day.. they are still a billion dollar company and compnies want money."
" @zennir48  new mechanics? revive is new mechanics on hsr? or its the global passive you are talking about. if yes then that not a very good one. one mechanics they can do that is not as bad as being global passive is just make it team wide passive(no activation required just meeting certain requirements) an example would be similar to march hunt has but team wide not just for herself, hp increase for the team the unity with that passive. and not something that will take effect just from having them even in team the unit is not part of"
" @zennir48  i've been telling people that this ""global passive"" is a special thing that literally only reserved for a special anniversary characters like last year we got acheron that has a technique that is still the only one that is able to kill mobs instantly. castorice's revive isn't really that good either man these small percentage of the total population quite literally freaked out because of all of these ""what ifs"" lmao. i dabbled in leaks still to this day there's no datamined information about GP other than castorice's"
they definitely gonna do that
Or maybe they should change the global passive into a party passive and have it so her passive activates if she is in the current team.
Seth complaining about game balance has to be one of the most ironic takes
THIS.
"You should Shield or Heal the semi-dead person. If you fail to do that, they die for reals"
You did not get the point of the video!!
You completely ignored everything Vars said.
8:17 look at this shit 8:25
"I agree. I got fully convinced to skip her after doing her trial. I prefer to play and see my character and not the summon when in combat, especially In this game where there's not much to do in the overworld."
@lulu -jpg Its Fine. Everyone has their own fun. Respect each other ☺
" @lulu-jpg  Castorice still fights normally in battle even when she summons her dragon, wtf are y'all on about..."
"​ @TheJH1015  you see and use the dragon way more in battle than Castorice herself, that's their point."
"Its funny how im actually completely opposite. Im a guy that always pick summoner class for most games, so when I saw a dragon I just had to save for her on my second acc lol. Though I'm basically done with spending money anyway, except for battlepass here and there when I feel like it. Really just depends on how they handle character buffs and story telling from now on"
 @edandeyo  yup!!
"Okay this is just straight up opinion based? Like other people have more fun with summoners than playing the characters, im neither of them and it only depends on how fun playing the summon is."
@Istaroth07 update: i pulled her and her lc haha
" @lulu-jpg   Lol me too, I couldn't resist since I just love pink haired characters sad that she will forever be hated by some people because the devs decided to be greedy."
"they did it first in zzz with miyabi, but no one talked about it because 💤💀🎮"
"My game froze during that scene and booted me out of it lmao
It's like it was protecting me from poor marketing choices"
​@PhoebeBonkStick Mostly cause Miyabi was built up since the games beta and doesn't fundamentally change how the game works even if she is very atypical
NAAAH BRO IT TRIED TO DO IT AGAIN AND IT FROZE TOO
"The moment i saw this i was like ""they don't even try to hide it anymore"""
"​ @PhoebeBonkStick  Perhaps because Miyabi wasn't that much of an issue? Like, the biggest problem i've heard was her giving powercreep. And how big it was? 30% i guess?"
"oh my lord it’s an animation to promote the banner character, lots of gacha games do this.. you’ll live"
..with a button to take you directly to summon her😂
That wasn't even a problem for me since I found that normal. The fact they have the shopping cart shown at the top of gui is worse.
"​ @rain1184 yes, but do they need to send me to the banner? What's the point? They could have made the animation play when you click on the banner icon."
*go to shop
" @PhoebeBonkStick  Probably because ZZZ is doing very badly, at least for a Hoyo game, and 1.4 was a desperate effort save the game from steady decline by implementing all the feedback people already gave them a thousand times over since the first open beta. That's the point. When companies do this it's because of desperation. Something is going very wrong at Hoyoverse."
Ok so what about the 3 other page of hoyo trying to make me buy something before i even get to the game 💀​ @rain1184 
"​ @PhoebeBonkStick  Miyabi's a void hunter. Meanwhile, Cas isn't even an emanator yet given such special treatment."
" @Otherface  Retroactively she hasn't power crept the game, dps released after her are following the standard power level and she is being made to be an outlier, not setting a new norm."
 @strobo308  Lore accurate Castorice killing stuff.
F2p needs to silence man
 @DragonKingTaidus didn’t she bring a new type
" @PhoebeBonkStick  because you'll anger the miyabi fanboys + hoyo themselves with their golden child powercreeper that appears in every version even when it has nothing to do with her (rip Rina and Belobog Heavy Industries), will get a skin wit alternate effects, got a whole new element, and still dominates the meta even after eve and sanby"
" @xenosaber77  yup, here's the miyabi fanboys"
There's no fucking way people are complaining about a little animation in a game that's literally supposed to sell it's characters
" @Uhhneri   Oh, i'm sorry, I didn't expect to speak to a child. Move along then 👍"
@Dia_D_Auth  Yup. People complaining about nothingburgers. Even Anby isn't interested
" @xenosaber77  sure thing, although the projection is insane"
" @Uhhneri  Yeah i agree, hope you grow up into someone respectable, lil bro."
Why not putting it when you pull her yikes. Instead putting it login
"Have you celebrated your Castoversarry yet? It's a holy anniversary to pull for Castorice. Have you the watched the special entrance animation? Have you clicked warp now button? Have you topped up yet? Have you used the super duper deals to top up? Have you watched our total of 20 minutes anime episode about her? She has a global passive too you know right? How about flashy BP rewards with her icon? Have you talked to her on phone? Have you spent money yet? Have you seen the super model pose she hits in the launcher? Anaxa is the guy in the background but we havent figured out who he is yet, better PULL FOR CASTORICE. And we have added a 2nd logo to celebrate our 2nd anniversary by the way. That was all the budget we had left after giving Castorice special petal animations at the last moment. Happy holy Castorice day!"
" @Danny-mp8dq  THE CASTOVERSARRY IS REAL, ALL HAIL BUTTERFLY POU"
@shutup1037  Hoshimi Miyabi
It was annoying
"​​ @Plazumah it takes about two seconds to press go to banner and two more seconds to press the ""esc"" key and exit. do you all ever tired of whining about non issues"
"It was actually awesome, it ran very smooth on both my pc and phone (yeah my phone is s25 ultra hence it ran smooth)"
"i mean it's weird that it's a unique animation, but it's not really that surprising that they shove new characters in your face when you login, they obviously want you to pull.

instead of unique animations, they should've just showed her animations in game to make people want to pull her, and make it so all new units have this going forward, but also allow everyone to skip it.

if you don't know, this is exactly what epic seven, a turn based game like hsr, does for every new character."
 @PhoebeBonkStick  yeah this also CLEARLY showed that if no one talks about it they will do it again.
 @Stealthless_  a unique animation with a button that says GO PULL NOW
 @PhoebeBonkStick  did they? I don’t remember that at all
And I still ignored it they were legit trying to make me pull nah I'm good
"​ @FlashKillerX there's an x button 
It's not forcing you to go to the banner screen"
​ @FlashKillerX a unique animation with X button on top of the screen.
there are many issues in the game and you guys chose an intro animation that takes 2 seconds to exit
​ @rain1184  unfortunate I didn't live. Fuck Global Pasive
"​ @thiccychiccy1157  It created a bad president, it created a bad president, it created a bad president. How many times do we have to repeat this old man"
​ @kangelparfait  Every problem is a problem
​@PhoebeBonkStick  we just didn't care that much bro even though we were aware it wasn't as deep as Castorice
Immediately turned me off from pulling her. Maybe I’ll reconsider on her rerun but gosh they’re pushing her HARD.
" @_lynxninja_4783  I know there’s an X button but it’s small and the color almost blends in, and the go to warp button had a big eye catching animation. It just reads as desperate to me"
"@FlashKillerX  you want the x button to be bigger?
Also desperate? Lol
The only people quitting are sweaty players  which aren't a lot."
I didn't get it though...
"What's wrong with that, I liked it. I would like to see it for every new character when their banner starts."
i like the character so it was cool for me but i get what are yall saying
 @strobo308  It's telling you to buy a better pc rather than spending it on gacha games bro.
"​ @PhoebeBonkStick miyabi is a void hunter, thats a big deal in zzz, also zenless doesn't have any powercreep since you can clear endgame content with only A rank agents. Even the herta who's a literal emanator never got this kind of treatment. And she's like a big deal in game in terms of title and power."
Ok crybaby. It's marketing
" @Zek106  Who says I'm spending a dime lmao, If I had money to waste on gacha I'd have upgraded my PC a long time ago"
With the only option to exit it being going to the wish menu... (I think)
​ @Otherface  isn't m0 Miyabi better than m6 Ellen? Who only came out like 4 patches earlier?
IKR! They want us to want her BAD 😅💀
Is this supposed to be a big deal? Literally every gacha makes the jump towards making marketing of this sort after a while. Even Dokkans 10 year old self went this route after about 9 years.
 @PhoebeBonkStick  that's not even the same thing...
" @rain1184  that doesn't make it right, what a dumb argument"
" @Otherface  30% ???????
She was stronger then Ellen E6 by x2 

She was litterally 500% stronger in term of dmg than a ELLEN YOU CALL THAT 30% YOU FUKING ZZZ SHILL ?"
"what force you to roll miyabi? nothing! if you want to do it, do it. if not stfu."
It's normal for this kinda game tbh
@ And there's an X button on the top-right corner that blends in so well with her dragon :face-orange-frowning:
​ @PhoebeBonkStick yea we got a free character in that version I wonder why people was not angry
and when you try to speak up about the whole fandom thinks you're a meta slave and that its not a big deal. Most of these players are casuals who don't know any better
I believe our next 4 star is mr reca in 3.8...which...basically we're going a whole entire version without a single 4 star
​ @filmaphobic Let's keep it that way. Not everyone should be crying and seething
"There is only one thing I'll give to HoYo shills and it's that this specific passive is pretty bad.


But that is also a problem.
The fact that it is a crutch passive that only activates if you do poorly is why it's easy to dismiss any legitimate problems people might have with passives as a whole. 



I predict that couple patches from now community will be crying about dogshit state of balance that no one can explain how it even came to being. All the while every other unit will be giving some unique passive that all end game content requires you to have to beat it. 

But then again, some people are still denying that powercreep exist, so maybe it'll be more than few patches from now"
"Yeah cause we don't care about global passive or whatever. Even if they add more, I HIGHLY doubt they would center the difficulty of endgame content around the assumption that you have alot of them. They're not stupid"
"​ @filmaphobic ""don't know any better""
Really? 
More like not taking a game too seriously.
You ain't dying from a game of being greedy."
"Apparently you can't enjoy HSR anymore without being ""brainwashed"" 🤡"
​ @Grayewicked  I mean they're doing that right now what not to say
"HSR and goonering waves are the worst right now, not a single 4 star for months.."
 @blueraine21  because 4 stars simply just don't sell
 @_lynxninja_4783  the players who don’t understand why such things added is bad for the game will influence the game in the future to add more greedy things and the play base won’t bat an eye bc they think it’s ok
 @xenosaber77  omfg get out if you don’t give a shit
"Extra irony they had a dorm system and a farmable divine key system in honkai impact 3rd which served as damage bonuses, sp recovery and so on…

Too bad they made it further greedy by needing to chase older s rank gacha units to double s or get TWO divine keys of the same category to get level two versions of stronger damage and sp recovery which made small enough differences to reach minor thresholds for loops and so on, which further got worst when signature gear in honkai 3rd often would give one or more instance of massive bonus sp and sometimes switch cooldown reduction to make them skip one or more rotations out of time sinking heavy crap.

If you remember the flamechasers’s eden character in hi3rd and pardofelis, then you know why that crap was beyond broken."
"it isn't even that strong of a global passive, it revives them with 1 hp and they need to be healed even if they are shielded or they'll die. Well if you are running a preservation comp her passive is already useless because you have no healers. Sometimes you will die, resurrect into 1 hp and it happens instantly so the enemy just smacks you dead again. It's not really OP enough to change meta"
"@escapetherace1943  That's beside the point, it's the door opening to more global passives in the future."
"​ @escapetherace1943  

And apparently people ignoring the boogers on the wall again:

1. Even if they were to die immediately after thar next turn from being revived from it, thats essentially Blood-zerg gimmick where they do one last grenade charge to do an impact, which is fantastic for some tactics to cheese out one more last value`age.

2. Being able to use it to straight up IGNORE a one-shot mechanic that has such an absurdly high ceiling to clear, can enable people to just LET the death happen, revive after it, pop an ultimate or some special reaction effect and they effectively got a free get out of jail free card to IGNORE a mechanic and now have 2 rotations to obliterate the boss instead of 1 when that mechanic shows up the first time.

3. They introduced an entire UI for it, they are gonna straight up add way more of these global passives and like PRI-arms in HI3rd did and Fatui harbingers were like in Genshite, they will make it the most cancerous thing ever...

Which P.S. they are totally, NOT, gonna put a LIMIT on how many you have out, because then that would limit how much FOMO they can cram into players to spend on as many global passive units...

Ultimately though: it sets up multiple factors between exploitation of a gimmick, flip off newer players who were not around when this character was available and suffer and praying for them to return but its always put on another super awesome char`s banner because Hoyo-verse reruns SUCK in general.

And of course, now hoyo-verse is gonna ramp up the power escalation EVEN HARDER, by having the justification of `people can now have access to a Bailu ENDURE that also flips off preservation shield-stacking nuts by demanding a heal to make it fully like a Baihu revive except it can apply to more then just a single person basically.

And just a reminder: They dont even need the global passives to be on `good units` in particular, they could straight up make some of the character buffs make characters like Silverwolf, Kafka or Blade also have global passives to further the B.S. on newer players who now have to chase super old dated characters regardless of how much they been buffed and will make it even harder to deal with chasing new chars vs chasing reruns because of global passive editions.

Which you can imagine, them purposely releasing HOOK level of trash characters that just get some super special global passive like a 5% permanent weakness dmg bonus or a 5% shield at the start of combat or 10% increase to healing value would sound so small, but then it can not only stack up, but maybe even synergize into extra B.S.

HELL, imagine the introduction of a global passive that gives +1% hp regen (or Life steal) to the entire party, that would straight up be some B.S. hoyoverse would shove out and conviently, FIX the problem of CAST OF RICE`s global passive, thus demanding people have to pull on 2 limited characters for a broken `sell you the problem, charge extra for a solution, 6 months later`, level of B.S."
they just hotfix censor cantarella and fleurdelys so now
"Like many people have said, her revive isn’t the issue, the addition of global passives in general is. With the way HSR handles ‘difficulty’ (aka HP inflation and hyper-specific gimmicks designed to make you wanna pull whatever shiny new units they’ve just released), global passives just add another avenue for them to make combat more player-hostile than player-friendly. 

Down the line we might get, for example, a character that turns all excess crit rate into crit dmg for every character in your account. Sounds neat, right? Only sucks for people who don’t want that unit in particular. But then that same update they release a boss who only takes damage if your character crits, essentially making that character as close to mandatory as possible for whatever end-game content that boss appears in (unless you’re masochistic enough to play the losing game known as ‘relic min-maxing’)"
"The dps might be restricted, but they're def one upping one another. Therta in a 4 star team does almost more damage than Acheron with jiaoqiu.... It's not normal
Please let's be worried about the game now before it's too late, don't make the mistake the genshin community did"
​ @DG_Toti You say that and they just showed that is what they will do with the Netherwing fight causing all your units go down to 1 and bypast shields meaning it's a boss that literally pushes Castorice's passive to activate.
"​ @DG_Toti Please you might as well not make up any extra examples like that ""crit"" one by yourself. Repeating the words made up by ccs should be enough."
" @typhus_the_fallen9685  Hm, that’s a bit arbitrary, the HP mechanic of the boss however is more significant in weight compared to the global revive mechanic"
" @DG_Toti  I don't know. Like I said, It would surprise me, when global passives become alot more and would Impact stats directly...
Also to the boss-fights, I don't know any Boss, where you absolutely need to use the ""obvious"" mechanic.
Like Sam's or death's or Sundays Boss-fight. 
The closest might be the Adventurin fight."
 @AxilFodilIghouba  What did happen in genshin? Felt most chars in Natlan were mid and hyperbloom is still my go to.
"Castorice needs a sustain like any other unit that’s literally not even a restriction lmao she just doesn’t make use of preservation and we 2 preservation units so it’s not a big deal herta with 4 star erudition is stronger than most full five star teams in the game .
Mydei is one of the strongest units in the game and he has auto , Aglaea wants Sunday that’s her restriction just like feixiao with robin, ff/rappa with ruan mei/fugue.

Castorice is literally doing sustainless team numbers with a sustain along with team wide all type res pen unkillable aoe no skill point consumption insane single target damage because she has bounce she ults sixty times a cycle there’s no restriction on her character in fact her being able to benefit that well from a sustain literally is what makes her so good because a lot of teams don’t really have much as much benefit from them compared to units like castorice in the first place she should be doing way less damage for the cost of being able to charge her ult off a sustain but she just puts out sustainless team damage numbers while being fully safe immortal and overpowered with no cost or downside besides lack of lightcone options even then she’s still extremely strong and she’ll get more LC in the future"
What do you think dangerous precedent means
"I left Guardian Tales a long time ago. Something tells me i'm doing the right thing for not coming back.

Still, Hsr nor the gacha industry SHOULD EVOLVE INTO THAT"
Guardian tales is peak as a casual player
My fellow Dumbface Knight
"I have spent around 40 dollars total since guardian tales came out and I have every single passive there is to get xd you can't compare this to GT, you can compete with whales in GT with enough time and investment."
" @mrdata9823 Also, no character is really limited time only in GT, except for collab units and equipment. And those don't have stat bonuses in collection or knowledge."
"honestly they arent really comparable because no one really plays PvP except Team Death Match ( where collection bonuses are all enabled by default for everyone ) but whales anyways. most of the playerbase just cares about the story and coop and real competition occures mostly in Raid

Also it came with the game since day 1, unlike HSR adding it way down the line"
Doing anything but understand the point
Isn’t that the same with most 2.0 and 1.0 characters at their release? Lol
" @AnimeShortsContent1  You have never played a gacha before Genshin. Tell me I'm wrong and I will call you a liar. This is not the norm in gacha games, nor was it the norm in HSR at the beginning."
"@ Gacha history: Battle cats, Genshin, wuwa then star rail"
​@Satyr42 This is the norm in HSR. Every 5 star character released in HSR have been top tier for endgame modes because they have stage buffs that heavily shill towards the newest 5 star.
" @MultiDragonreaper  it wasn't the case up until Acheron's release. Up to then everything was still somewhat balanced. yes Jingliu was insanely strong but the gap between her and DHIL was not that massive. Sparkle is technically a better buffer but has some pros and cons compared to Bronya, who is her direct competition. Black Swan was the 5 star version of Sampo that DoT was waiting for, but she wasn't broken.

And then Acheron got released and completely destroyed any semblance of balance in terms of DPS output. Then we got Aventurine who trivialised enemy dmg output if you had him because he just refuses to die unless you used him against DoT-focused enemies. Firefly, Feixiao, Rappa, all three of them completely destroyed the damage floor and partially ceiling of what their path was expected to perform as. Boothill too in a way but he's a mechnically much more complicated character to use correctly.

So far in version 3, all the limited DPSes seem to perform roughly at the same DPS output level, one being a bit better than the others depending on the specific environment or situation. Meaning you're not gonna lose out if you don't have all or multiple of them. so far."
" @Satyr42  the characters next patch are supposedly kinda mid tho. hyacine is basically lingsha but a bit worse in general, but is pretty much a specialized healer for castorice. cipher is counterintuitive, bc her follow up attacks want you to spam ult, but her ult generation can be slow, bc its made so that it can get a lot of stacks to increase the dmg, so its ""this to do this to do that but it does this."" cipher doesnt even replace topaz and numby in fua teams. nor does she find a place in acheron teams especially post e2 acheron. hoyoverse has obv held back so much in making the next characters op. im not excusing their terrible choices, but tribbie was also made so that the hp meta has a support. attack carries will nearly always prefer robin, and making hp scaling dps rely on robin is terrible. shes also made for self buffing characters, so she's kinda mid with characters like cipher and feixiao. aglaea is very hard to maximize, and mydei is very good, but has so many obvious issues. anaxa isnt meta, he's a hypercarry designed to be a support but has no buffs. he's one of the worst hypercarries in the game, even worse than seele. he's just gonna be another therta shill. the only true meta characters in 3.0 so far is tribbie, therta, and castorice. its so exaggerated how ""meta"" the new characters are. even then, castorice's passive changes nothing in sustainless and if u die then there's already a problem with ur run. her dmg is still a good ways lower than thertas, and if u compare their E2s therta pulls ahead by so much. yall overreact on this so bad."
"​ @AnimeShortsContent1 Exactly, gachas have inevitable powercreep, it's all about how resistant they are, and HSR is by far the least powercrept gacha I've played. People who say otherwise clearly have only played HSR and no other gachas. This is the most f2p gacha I've seen"
 @Naoto-kun1085  as someone who has played wuwa and literally genshin both are less powercrept and more f2p friendly (all tho not sure if genshin is neccessarily more f2p friendly but wuwa is)
"@AverageRNGHater  Tbf Wuwa is half as old as HSR so it's not noticeable yet, it took two years for HSR to have any signs of powercreep"
" @Naoto-kun1085  fair enough, but genshin is (excluding mavuika whos from like 5.3) doing pretty well with powercreep"
"@TheJH1015  I don't think you get what I mean in my last comment. All the endgame modes like to heavily favor the newest 5 star character to make them FEEL like the best character in the game. That's how the games baits you into thinking the newest character is a must pull.
Example being when Ruan Mei released, the Moc buff was Weakness break as much enemies as possible to do massive damage. When Acheron released the moc buff was every character can debuff an enemy so she can spam her ultimate faster. When Ratio released the Moc buff was every enemy gets debuff on a new cycle and so on."
"​ @Satyr42  It was absolutely a norm at beginning of Hsr, the hell are you saying mate."
"No. It’s no more a problem than power creep in any gotcha. Or a new mechanic that needs a new character. 

Sorry, but the whole “could be a problem” is the basis of gotcha games. 

Are you new to this?"
I hope zzz doesn't add global passive like this dogshit game 😂
HONKSHIT COULD NEVER 😂
bUt tHe pReCeDenT! 🤡
"Honestly, just stopped playing after Castorice

If the game will make more global passives like these, I'm not interested"

"Are you right? Yes.
Should we not complain? No. 

Just because something, maybe the norm, doesn't make it immune to criticism."
"even if they do, which i hope they won’t, global passives (if we’re talking about something similar to castorice) would be pretty useless because you don’t need defensive boosts that much unless skill issues"
Honkai **** Rail sounds better than Honk**** in my opinion
"Me: uninstalled Star rail.
Now: Playing Infinity Nikki (good event: party) and Black beacon(new game) . 😊❤"
Unfortunately they already have if what I've heard is correct amphoreous will basically be redesigning combat entirely just to make horizontal investment the norm
"bit late for that, the game is more predatory now than ever. Although idk if I'm crazy or if my build is bad or what but my E0S0 castorice is honestly not that strong in combat. Not nearly as strong as I expected her to be. I dont have tribbie so that could be it but I do have E1S1 Ruan mei who i've heard is in some cases even better than E0S1 tribbie"
" @FlashKillerX  Im 1-Cycling MoC hitting about 3-4 Million damage in MoC, 3.4-5k APOC Shadow score, 4-7 Million Damage in PF. 

Without her LC and Tribbie E1 you are missing out on alot of her potential unfortunately."
"@ obviously. She seems like the kind of character who simply requires vertical investment to put up the kind of performance everyone perceives her as having. As E0S0 with the battle pass light cone and without Tribbie she’s good enough to use but nothing special. I personally was able to 4 cycle MOC with her but I was a singular attack in each phase off of the cycle timer, so I could have gotten that down to 2 cycles. So an optimized E0S0 is capable of 2 cycling without Tribbie it seems, which sounds good but one side and the whole MOC buff is hand tailored to her and her kit so what happens when it isn’t?"
"Too late, hoyo isn't going to stop until it pushes it's players as far as it possibly can."
yeah u better enjoy her now while u can because 3 patches later she will be at the corner of the wall again.
"But meta over fun. My opinion.
Dragon, boring.
Good luck for pulls.😊"
"@AP-d2f The rotation definitely isn't boring the skill expression but yeah Meta always usually ends up being fun for me coincdentally. 

This is the most fun rotation in the game I've had since Yunli."
"Top up services are always a risky bet. Wouldn’t recommend taking more sponsors from them in the future, the only person I know that has tried using a “trusted” one they used a creator code with ended up getting their Genshin account banned a month or so later. They hadn’t used mods, cheats, private servers, or done any account sharing. Use at your own risk."
These sites always seam so tempting for the cheaper top ups but at the same time they look so risky in so many ways.
Will they also give the same bonuses that the game gives when buying?
​ @jensei9870 i actually got the double
"Came back here to see how the people that were saying ""phainon gonna have a global passive"" and the ""collab characters WILL FOR SURE have global passive"" people were doing nowadays lmaoo"
"i mean, you don't have to spend money to play, or even to pick up the 5 stars. and what point of making the game if not for money. duh."
"If revive was that op bailu would not be d tier
It's more of a problem if in the future they continue to release stronger and stronger global passives"
it’s just another turn. ONE turn.
I lost my castorice after someone hacked me hoyo didnt wanna believe it was my account 😐
"step 1. quit
step 2 return when they announce eos, 
step 3 get whatever recent broken unit, 
step 4 clear all content with ease"
What game is this
With aventurine I will never see castorice passive 😅
"I still don't see how this is pay to win as this logic would apply to any character released because of the power creep. If it was tied to a constellation yeah pay to win ince its not, then its no different"
I can see both arguments. And would agree with both arguments. 😅
Wait why does her lore have to anything to do with her being broken and pay to win?? XD Weird defense of a character being pay to win.
"""It's not the passive, it's the precedent"" The next three characters after castorice have no such thing as a global passive. I expect global passives to be an anniversary character thing."
"Op ability:
Boss' turn
1. Boss uses weak single target attack
2. Boss uses extremely strong aoe or single target attack
-> Teammate gets killed and revived
3. Boss uses weak aoe attack
-> Teammate is dead again

Yes sounds definitely op"
If your characters are dieing at all its just a skill issue. I think the more concerning matter is the HP inflation and the increased toughness un the end game content rather than a free revive.
I mean shes special bcs shes an anniversary characters. People just mad bcs they were getting Bronya instead of Castorice lol stay mad
Its better then having no castorice at all idk why therr mad that they cant use 16k or 32k jade to get her
"her passive won't even work unless u have a healer or if u DIE, dying in hsr is practically impossible💔"
in the other game venti is the anemo archon and he can terraform mountaine lorewise but got nerfed and now a homeless inazuman is better to obtain
"1 revive per fight, and at 1 hp... that isn't really much."
Wait. You died during fight?😂
i think global passives are gonna be an anniversary character thing. one global passive per year is pretty good i'd say. mitigates a bit of the still very present power creep
It makes me laugh how people complain about this.Maybe they didn't hear or see the part where it says that a 1HP revives them so you have to be really lucky not to be attacked by air or the character just revived 😂😂
"bro, its a single player game, its not that deep bro"
"Pay to win? It's a gacha.. it's either be consistent and patient or not be poor. Like damn kids these days.. besides not like the passive is worth jack lol the fact your units got exploded once meant your team was too weak to begin with what's the revive gonna do? Power of friendship lol.. Again just don't play it. 


Damn I have castorice and my underperforming The herta team is better than her given my 2 teams don't really drop against bosses so the passive is as useful as your brains. I didn't even know she had the passive til I saw it on YouTube lol"
Honestly the passive usually is wasted on a less important char for me I know that’s less so late game but the char dies anyway that turn anyway but honestly if they restrict it to 1 global passive allowed at once I’m happy cause I don’t want you to need like 15 chars for all global boosts
I have never used her passive during moc
"i have her, so... i support this LOL"
How is it p2w  I'm new and 5 stars don't seem hard to get
"Also, Mooncocoon makes it so that it simply delays downing as if they do not gain a shield or are healed by their next turn they immediately get downed in this new update."
"I think this is stupid, I beat the hardest version of Nikador with a complete F2P 4 star team just cuz and it still was easy. THEY WERENT EVEN FULLY BUILT. 
Soooooooooooo SKILL ISSU---"
"As a Wuwa player. Shorekeeper makes your team immortal. Someone dies and she revives them with full HP and only losing 1/2 of her own HP. If you Have Cantarella, you can heal Shorekeeper in like 10 seconds so yeah, it's more insane"
W8 u need to have castorice for this ????
"I got a solution, save up your pulls and pull for her on her first rerun in like six months. people bitch about her passive but they don’t realize that all they need to do is pull for the damn character. I pulled for her because she looked super beautiful and I didn’t even care for passive, but it’s just an added bonus."
Lore accurate? Then acheron should have a one too like at least the ability to bypass that 'light post' enemies shield when at least using her ultimate. ❤
Well since honkai have different combat which i think it's not interesting and it's boring i think she is good help to finish fight faster
why is this bad ?
"Suggestion: make the global passive only active in Amphoreus
But keep the passive on in other places if she's on the team"
no really pat to win in a gatcha game
so thats why my team just got revived even if i didn't have her on my team lmao
If you dead while play auto in hsr mean your gears is shit and not ready yet to play auto 😂
It this reason why people bombarded 2 star reviews at playstore 😂 petty behavior i was so confused...
"Why should someone have to pull a character? The entire idea behind global passives is dumb, when they could have just made it a trait"
@ Why should it be free for everyone? How do you expect the developers to make money if it’s just free?
 @ZhenyaScheu  Where did you get “free” from? My point is someone shouldn’t “need” a to pull for a specific character and the whole mechanic of a global passive is pointless when you have traits
"@ well if you don’t pull for her, you don’t get the passive. It’s pretty simple. I don’t get how hard it is for people to understand that you have to have the character for it to work. And you think they’re just gonna give it out as a trait. It’s all about making money and at the end of the day if they give you another reason why you want to pull a character or pay for a character they’re going to do that because that’s how developers work with most of today’s games. Try to make P2W as possible. Nobody needs to pull her. It’s just that if you don’t have her, you can’t use the passive.  pretty simple. Let’s say she didn’t have the global passive. So if that’s the case, how much do you think people are going to pay for her?"
"@ and just to let you know, I didn’t even know she had a global passive. I just pulled for because I saved up my wishes and I find her quite cute/beautiful. Girls with pink hair tend to be quite cute except for March 7th she’s annoying in my opinion."
" @ZhenyaScheu  I feel like your missing the point, Castorice isn’t the problem it’s the concept of global passives that have people up in arms. If she didn’t have global passives I pretty sure the same people would still pull for her (more actually, if you include the people who skipped her because of the passive).

There’s a reason why global passives are practically unheard of in gacha games"
"I got Castorice on one account but not the other, and I've never spent any real money on the game."
"The problem is less that it isn't cool, or that the character lore doesn't support it, it's that it sets a precedent that it's okay to do that. I guarantee this won't be unique to Castorice in a few months"
"It also revives not only one but all the team members that die in one and the same turn.
i pulled her on accident, i didn't even know what her powers are but i was like ""omg she has a giant dragon, ima try her out"". Tho I still lost many battles even though her revive mechanic exists. I also didn't even know how to use the dragons power correctly until i played her tutorial😅 still, you don't need to have ""meta"" characters to enjoy the game, just play however you want"
"Doesn’t matter what happens- players gonna cry about it. Free to play Company allows people who spend money be in a slightly better position than people who don’t spend money. What a terrible greedy corporation. If you don’t like it, how about don’t play it? Or you like to whine?"
So it’s just Gerard’s ability but instead of just being applied to only one person it’s applys to your team?
its litteraly bailu but off team i mean the passive i dont see a problem plus her passive isnt really that good in my opinion
Well I've got no problem with It but here's the good part I won my 50/50 and got here light cone early on my main f2p account
Got 5 pity castorice
"Lol, I got her for free"
Yeah that passive cab save you but most of the time the all will die again
😂😂 jelous i got her and i like her passive stop cryng 😢😢
Only one HP? What's stopping your character(s) from getting one-shot AGAIN?
I think if they do the next pasives not that strong there will be any problem i think the comunity has more fear at what could cone tomorrow than castorice pasive it self
tbh her global passive hasnt helped me at all yet in some cases i rezzed and died instantly cuz enemies got their turn during the rez lol
"I got her because I love her character and I can say the passive its not as broken as it seems (but I'm not a hardcore player so what I know), but yeah, now there is a possibility that in the future the powercreep will be even worse than in genshin.
They are not going to nerf this mechanic so the only solution I see is to give older characters a global too, silver wolf, jingliu,  fu xuan, loucha, kafka, black swan, there are a lot of them who lore wise should have insane abilities but are left behind. 
Of course, nothing wild and not to everyone but that's difficult to balance"
"People will always find something to complain about, whether it’s character designs, character kits, synergy, etc. I just pull whoever I’m interested in and play around with different teams until something clicks. If characters are built well then they generally won’t die unless you’re fighting something that’ll hit multiple times in a row before you can move, and even then you can toss in Bailu and get a res that way. It’s definitely a huge thing to have, but if you’re dying to stuff then a 1 time revive that leaves you on 1hp won’t be gamebreaking"
Castorice literally wants to save lives.. It's so perfect to her..
Blade: LET ME DIE
It's called a skill issue. This doesn't make or break whether your team gets spanked in end game or even just normal content. 😂
"""lore accurate"" make her kill anyone in one hit then, that would be lore accurate as well"
I commented this before watching the the full thing so I didn’t know about the part where it works even if she ain’t on the team. I’m to lazy to edit it
Surprised the American government isn’t on their tails like they were for Genshin..
"Its just one hp
It wont make a difference if the enemy is still in its turn
I swear people cry about everything😂
Just pull for her if u think its that big of a utility😂"
"As non hsr player, i could say the one what made her op is her unstoppable beauty"
"I mean - people cleared all the content before without her. I’m sure they can do it again. And some bosses - like Sunday - were damn near impossible for free to play players that didn’t have 6 copies of specific characters and their lightcones. That felt pretty pay to win too, but they fixed it."
yall can't enjoy anything can you💀
Ngl i didn't ment to get her... i wanted blade :)
"Her passive is not really a big deal to be honest and definetly doesn't force people to get her, you get a sort of revive 1 time which is only an issue if your not building your chars well enough to do dmg and survive.
The idea of global passives in the game isn't good but it's definetly not a broken passive like this video portrays it."
Seen as making the game “pay to win” bro it’s a gatcha game 😂
"Wait the fuck up, that shit activates regardless of everything??? I've been taking a longish break so I can finish all of the new planet after whatshisface fails to become a god, and I only came back for dailies/weeklies so I could get Castorice, and now you're telling me I get a free revive once per battle? Mfw my account is ruined by difficulty curving skills"
"That anyone is still defending hsr is crazy to me. Its Like...Bro, what are you on? Its global buff, and you cannot seriously expect this Type a shyt to Stop with castorice lol. Remember the ""hsr is better than genshin"" Guys? Lmao😂"
"""Greedy and stupid"""
"Someone might think it okay it alright.”This game is a story game no one point a gun at your head to end Moc” if u think like this,You are an idiot! This game isn’t focus on only story but also the endgame mode and the fact that the character later on will definitely have global passive will make it so the worth of my farming time and E6 i do and got in the past go to wasted😭"
Gacha game...people complaining about pay2win...what?
I got her on my first ten pull and she’s broken. People just wanna complain. You don’t have to get her. Play the game as is. Simple
Is it good? Yes! Do u need it for endgame? No! Is it broken in the pvp battles? Yes! Oh hold on there is no pvp so i dont care what other players say :D
"Rezero reference

(End me)"
this controversy is so old
its not her passive as such but its the implication of more global passives
poor people seething
Im okay with this *
"Well, it's anniversary character...last anniversary character is also very good. And her passive ain't that good, if this passive activates when 1 single character down and still on enemies row, it ain't working unless your healer got ult. Look back to another anniversary character, she can use her skill to instant kill enemy when not entering battle. I don't see why people think she's overpowered, good dmg? Nah there's more character can do that either, good passive? No heal you die, also she requires some actually tactic cuz she consumes ally's hp. Also she ain't powerful to fight enemies with herself only. There's more character after her. You can still obtain other new characters."
I got her in ten rolls idk what people are talking about play the game you get free 90 rolls 🤓🤓🤓
Bro im already struggling and this effect is clutching me if this is removed ill not be able to play endgame content also the accusations about pay to play are hilarious as i as a f2p has been collecting all the limited 5 stars i want with their light corn easily
"As long as it's not world wide DMG buffs or something like that, I think it's alr"
"1 global passive... and the people disliking it, are already making assumptions. It's understandable that this might bring a new model into the game, even changing late game to punish those that didn't pull, and creates fear for the future. But we have to see how it is made first, but seems like no, people have to judge way before hand. Now that she is out, people is still mad. Clearly many people aren't happy about this, and I mean MANY aren't, so devs COULD listen. But then I just want to ask one question: you are complaining about powercreep... now? So Acheron wasn't powercreep, Lunae wasn't either, Aventurine... who is he again? Well, Cas is? Also, you can complain about this ok, sure, but I want to remind everyone that completing everything, like MoC, AS and PF aren't obligatory AT ALL. They give many jades, sure, but like, you tried to do it and reach your real limit? Doesn't have to be everything, just what YOU CAN. Is it hard? Well what tf you expected? Everything in a silver plate? It's Hoyo. Many gachas have this, and this feature could potentially be a test from them, who knows, we all know Hoyo dosen't share info what so ever on their plans. Plus, who the tf said you can't complain and you HAVE to pull for Cas? Personally I think there are still reasons to play the game, whether its story, the characters, or even the endgame and events. I think Castorice's gp is the most controversial thing so far, at least from what i have seen. I just wish people remembered why they started playing the game and if they are really sure giving up everything for ONE SINGULAR fckg thing. I'm not saying, ""they should stay"", I'm saying, is it worth the drama?... Mind blowing. (srry for the long ahh text)."
She isn't mandatory just don't suck wtf
Just stop playing any game made by hoyo now I feel great
"""its part of her lore"". Its a made up story, change the damn lore. Some people man shit for brains"
Cry 😊babys
Ahh yes. I remember the time where Seele was the coolest 5 star character ever.
"But Bailu does the same thing , she can revive You once per battle. 🤡🤡"
Unless your making the game. Got to let it go cause it is not that deep. It's fine. It only helps those who are actually struggling with the game and is not a problem cause the game is not that hard that anyone is dying in game anyway 😅
"That’s why I quit the game 
Powercreep x10000"
"i think someone is a huge Lore neerd at hoyo thought it's gonna be a neat fit for this character,
And the Suites waved it through because they knew this would sell like hot-cakes and everybody is ""FORCED"" To get this unit and the future planned units with Global passives."
"It's just an odd choice to me, it would be fine if the revive happen only if she was on the team. I just hope it doesn't follow the trend of, we've made the new content for the new character specifically so if you don't have them, uh, i hope you have perfect relics. If they make content with the thought of, well everyone should have castorice so they should have a revive. I will be livid."
So i lost my 50/50 how long till her return 2 months 3 4?
if it’s authority of death wouldn’t that means she would kill off your team then? how does it align with the lore?
"""lore accuracy"" as a defense makes 0 sense. None of the other characters have to be lore accurate, most of them aren't even in their lore accurate paths (like ratio being hunt instead of erudition, or jing yuan being erudition instead of hunt), blade can fall in battle and is significantly weaker than his canon, acheron isn't one shotting every character, etc. There's no reason to completely break the game balance for ""lore canon"" when that was never an expectation from players to begin with."
Who isn’t surprised that people are complaining about it instead of having fun?
i really don't understand this passive
"Also, the precedent thing only matters if characters never came back around for rotation to pull for them. You don't have to spend money at all."
"I'm just saying I'm F2P, and I got her on accident in one ten pull. If anybody would suffer from not having her, it would be me, lol."
"As an Hi3rd player this is not new Hoyo already did this multiple times in Hi3rd, if you're a Meta slave you just gotta pull for the new characters to stay at the top ranking"
She is a must have chara because she is cute
if your character dies in a fight....your build/team/gear is probably not ready for the content...ressing up just makes him die again.
so people are mad because an OP character got released? (i just comeback to the game so i don't take those meta seriously)
For me there is no problem about this castorise character. Why? Because HSR is not a multiplayer game why do people bother about this XD
Me when I lie :
wow after 2 years ppl are starting to realize that honkai star rail is a cash grab game
"IT IS MAKING A GATCHA GAME “PAY TO WIN”
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
"""Just lore accurate"" 
That's the Glaziest Hoyoshill respond I've ever seen in my life"
Love how the majority of players were saying ‘I am pulling for Castorice’ before she even appeared as a character in the game and now the majority is complaining about her that Hoyo made her a must pull…people are fascinating creatures 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What? How is that OP? If it is in the middle of the enemies turns. Then you will die again. This is such a dumb controversy.
My reaction for all this 🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
.... LORE ACCURATE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The game is pay to win now cause of some stupid free revive thing? Wow! The game wasn't pay to win before this at all! Crazy turn of events. Here i was thinking ppl pay everyday in this game to win.
Dont care
Ay cry about it Get your money up not your funny up !
Realistically nobody actually cares nd just go oh global passive? Cool.
They nerfed it to once per battle wich I think is fine
Cry me a river 😂😂
Not on anyone’s side at all I think it’s a equal passive but you do know they are right? It’s basically lore accurate
dramatic dogs like u
Womp womp. Broke cope. Yall ever see a crackhead buckle and give up???? Hell nah ! WE LOVE POWERCREEP!!!!!! as if Acheron didn’t change farming. It’s not new.
It's just a game. At the end of the day. It's just code
"My first and only thought is ""This doesn't necessarily even save that character from multiple attacks"""
this isn't about castorice this is about global passive in the future this shit ll continue and bosses ll be stonger after that some charecters ll be must pull
Imagine getting mad about an OP character in single player game what you don't HAVE to get to complete the story
crybabys. 30k+ stellar jade waiting for her =)
"People realize they don't have to pull right?
Like, these basic bitches get that you can just not get one character if you don't like them?
Also, it's not multiplayer, if a person gets 1 extra revive for a solo run, who cares."
"Just get her, wtf?"
The REAL issue isnt HER passive but what it opens up for hsr in the future. More insane characters with absurd global passives and with how hsrs characters have been already this is not a reach
For end game player 😅
"After her, powerscaling on future units will be through the ROOF 😂😂"
"Couldn't care less, i like the idea of global passives, people can keep crying about it while everyone else has fun with the game"
It doesn't master. This game is not competitive and it's already easy without her
"Its kinda useless honestly
If you're dying to begin with that's the real problem 
The l actual issue is the future globals that'll come as precedent"
In my opinion it’s not that op like you still need to heal them and it’s only for people who were killed in that turn which (at least to me) is usually only one character also you could still be killed right after
"I mean it just bailu passive but improvise to be a global passive 
Gepard also had this passive which revive himself 
I don't get it why people are mad"
Is reviving with one HP really that broken I mean it’s just one HP either you have a healer or you die because you don’t and it’s not like she’s a healer right?(I don’t really remember the showcase if she does give your HP back more than yeah she’s broken)
Why they mad lol idc 😂
Castorice is not a must have character. Only reason for that is if you don't like her you can choose not to role. The developer create her base on her role in the story.
"Short sighted comment. 
The problem does not even start there. 

The truth is that in 2 years, you'll have 4 characters with a global passive. Il 5 years, all released characters will have a global passive. This will increase the divide between not only F2P and spender, but also F2P and low spending. 
In 3 years, you'll have global passives in genshin. 
In 5 years, you'll have global passives in wuwa. 


The problem is that you people don't see it is a test to check how the community reacts to being subjected to more FOMO. More manipulation to extract more money. It's the question of whether or not you support this business practices. And you don't, just stop playing. 

That's what people are doing."
"global passives are a good idea, It's just that its tied to a LIMITED 5 star that most people can't/don't want to get because of reasons. It would have been better if this was tied to story progression or if she was given out for free"
All the review-bombers were just SIlver Wolf's dummy accounts for Blade. uvu
Who care about her being broken ? You can full the game with only 4* and clear all content. OMG I HAVE A BROKEN UNIT ON SOLO GAME !!! AND I DONT EVEN NEED HER !!!!
"Bro its so simple if you die, and she revives you? Yknow by that point youre either bad or the Team aint working how its supposed to do. She's not a must, twitter people need to stop clowning. If they are so pissed and disapointed they should just quit. And let people enjoy the game and the Community.🤨😮‍💨"
wild hunt...
Oh nooooo! Not more broke children crying about something they cant afford in Gacha! Whatever will we do!!!!!
DUDE ITS JUST GIVING EVERYONE EXTRA 1 HEALTH WHAT CAN THEY DO LOL
I support this cuz i simp
"""a tactic by hoyo to boost money""? In the gacha game? The game where you give them money for anime girls they made an anime girl that you have to give them money for? thats crazy. you're crazy if you think a for-profit corporation would do something just for money."
There are only 2 char that will get global passivd 1castorice 2 cyrene they realize they fkd up so decided to make less
"How can anyone said this is unique innovation? This is clearly hoyo testing the water which how much they can milk their dwindling players

Let me remind you that this is not a pvp game, this is a single player game. How can hoyoshill be this stupid to understand this??"
"Why do this when they could've just introduced old RPG elements like LEADER SKILL

So whoever is set as leader, can have extra effects added.

This can help to buff older characters that have inherent issues which can be fixed with leader skill position but will need coverage elsewhere with alternative characters...

This makes layering of team build Alot more better

Then Castorice leader skill be that passive when activated as leader. This ties into her life death role while selling her character altogether and simultaneously fixing older characters...

I swear devs always start out good, then idk what the hell happened to them few years later... It's like they lost all common sense"
NOT in the team?! Now I get it why people are upset. wtf hoyo?
ppl are overreacting on this so hard
Why would it even work when shes not on the team
"Honestly I dont think this is a big deal, if they want to introduce a new off-field mechanic then it makes sense to do so with a relevant character. You don't need her to clear content. people are still clearing MOC 12 with only 4*s. There will be more characters with this mechanic in the future,"
"Guess what, there will be an Authority Critical boost, Damage boost or Speed in the lore next patches. it will make sense since ""It's in the lore""

Oh wait, welt has the power of gravity so it should make sense if they added global passive for welt with reduce speed or increase speed,  but i guess not, since it has low sales value, LOL maybe when they release a premium version of welt"
I can definitely see it being one global passive at a time also the pay to win argument is stupid cause this game has always been “pay to win”
"So what, why the western Fandom can't just enjoy the game without any drama,"
Until they realize we already have a character that can revive a teammate
How many times have you died? Just HOW did you even keep dying?
Bailu
"This global passive is kind of a nothing burger. A revival wont help much if your trying to finish end game content and if your doing end game content with charactors getting downed they arnt built right in the first place.

Asl ong as global passives dont get too crazy i dont see too much of an issue."
Thats not that broken
Can’t they change that ability into her card? So that it has to be equipped by someone so that it’ll work?
.....ngl i just like the character so was getting her anyway that passive is just a bonus. The ones complaining are just super sweaty at a single player game which makes no sense
"I really hope i can get castorice, i have 11k jades and 20 tickets"
"I don't play the game, but an effect that works even without the character on the field/ in the party seems broken.
Not broken in a bad way, but just stupid design."
It’s a PVE game. It’s not that serious
We just forgetting Bailu exists? Granted she has to be alive for it to work but it does the same exact thing while actually healing.
"Its not the fact that she can revive characters, its not the fact that she can revive while downed, its the fact that she can revive if you HAVE HER, now thats pay to win, if this goes well, we'll allow them to run away with even more in the future, unless they'll balance it by releasing a new consumable that can do the same and usable in all modes."
"I mean if you die in battle you wouldn't probably weren't ready or did a bad call so, it's a you problem"
"My opinion, we can treat the global passive as a new mechanic, for example if i dont pull for firefly, i cant play a team with break mechanic. Same goes for castorice, if i dont pull for her, i dont get to play the revive mechanic. Simple right?

P/s: I really dont have firefly, and I also do not consider to pull for castorice."
I still dont get this issue with global passives its not like this game has conpetitive mp
I know that It can make another global passive more Op. BUT if you are in endgame. And you are yapping about 1 time revive. It's shit. Litearly. This is useless. In endgame you eaither don't die. Or your entire team die. Never different
"Because of it, the ratings of HSR is now 2.9"
"This game ain't even pvp, whats so special with this revive mechanic for your dauly gameplay?"
Castorice glazers when someone criticised their fave character with the most valid reasons but they just defend her because “she looks nice” 🤡🤡
"Enemy aiming same target has always been a problem, dev would sell you a ""solution"" and preserve the problem rather than fixing it."
"As someone with Mydei, he solos everything, so I am only getting her cause her animations are cool"
always bailu doing that
People crying about PVE GAME ITS HILARIOUS
"She’s the most blatant gooner bait since varesa and it shows, literally the self insert character of hsr, the “nuh uh she’s the best cuz we say so” ahh character"
"THIS IS SO FUCKING WRONG!

THE PROBLEM IS GLOBAL UTILITY LOCKED BEHIND GACHA!!

These kind of Content farmer is part of the reason why HSR community stays dumb.

I doesn't matter who it is and what it is, global utility never got locked behind Gacha in this type of game. Global utility itself is NOT unheard of but BEFORE HSR they're locked behind resources that anyone can farm. These are usually really really late game grind and rarely game changing. Meanwhile Castorice GP is absurdly strong for a GP.. for references usually GP only give you maybe 5-10% bonus to stat AFTER long long grind.

Unless you're dumb as rock this much info should be enough to make you realize how bad it can be if GP gacha become the norm.

Now why do I care? Because as much as I hate it HoYo is basically Apple of gacha game right now. Meaning they're the litmus test of what kind of shitty move they can get away of before others followed suit. Gacha locked global passive in HSR is a small problem, but if it become common in Industry now it's huge problem."
Do we not know who Bailu is bro?? This is literally just a slightly upgraded bailu
"Idk how about don't do endgame content? the game isn't even hard if you take it slow and imagine complain over something like this. Simple, iif you don't want to follow the meta, don't do endgame content"
"“It’s lore accurate” 
It’s greed. Greed accurate. And waifu treatment."
"Slapping effect just from obtaining character are innovation to boost revenue, some upcoming character might have stronger effect and become must have character. It's way better to give these effect from item or something by completing story or world exploration."
"In my opinion.. I don't really think it's bad and all.. it's just that if this global passive stop just at castorice it's fine(since she'll get a rerun anyway f2p player will surely obtain her sooner or later)what if it's not stopping at castorice?we still living in ""what if"" situation so there is a possibility that there might be more coming soon right?"
E0S1 Hoolay still claps your entire team. The revive is just prolonging the inevitable
I support this unique feature
"Actually nothing wrong about castorice global passvie but the way they bring global passive to us player. Why only castorice that have this global passive? Why not give anaxa global passive too? From this, we can predict what hoyo will do with global passive. They will only give global passive to their favoured char meanwhile other char will left behind."
It's really not that deep guys
Unlike Genshin Honkai actually reward US with decent rewards
Yes because so many character dies in battle amirite
just stop complaining. dont see u complain when u make money out of hsr content?
"Then they should nerf the characters with global passive to not make it not too broken while also making these characters easier to obtain
And also have their rerun faster.
I mean Better pity and More rerun
That should balance it. Maybe not. What can I say? That should make it easier for f2p players to get it."
"Sure let's say it's for her lore, but it should be triggered when she's on the team."
I sure hope they let us turn it off. I want castorice but global passives feel like cheating.
"Not gonna lie, I wanted to go back and to HSR for 1h on the new patch release just to spend all my pulls on Castorice and uninstall again, but seeing as how they made this, I think I won't even bother doing that. Keep up the diarrhea, mihoyo, keep it up, you clearly don't know any better."
"It fits with her kit, castorices kit is unique which is why it wasn't changed, and if castorice didn't have that revive all allies would be dead and it would be kore difficult to survive."
did yall read the whole thing? it says u need to get a shield or heal or else they die again
This passive is for castorice team and for newbie . If you know how to play the game and have a character thats you build it good You don't need it.
 @Nahidlose-ox4wr  mad doesn't have castorice lol
"@ i skip her my dude, not everyone wants Castro. In fact, i got Anaxa and his lightcone :3"
"​ @randomsupporters3738 Not everyone has to like it and not everyone is upset they didn't get her. I personally skipped her because A I don't care for her personality, B I don't care for how it feels to play her, and C I have SEEN the carnage global buffs do. Only reason my 'alt' account has her is because it belongs to my sibling that doesn't play HSR and they make the pull choices. They don't even know about the global passive, just that she has a dragon."
"even without the global passive, she is a ""Must-Have""."
"Moc requires you not to die which is the only mode I ever die on, and even that barely happens. Only place I would find this useful is the max difficulty SU/DU which i don’t care about"
"Me : i just want the waifu.
The Ultamate Dragon Queen."
"Saying it’s lore accurate still doesn’t really make sense. Castorice’s whole ability mainly affects you if you are close to her (explaining why she tells you to keep a distance) so wouldn’t it make more lore sense to have the passive be only when Castorice is in the team where she’s y’know, close to you?

I don’t really think it makes sense to have it be global as Castorice wouldn’t be near you if not in the team."
"How to enjoy hoyoverse game 
1.Ignore community"
Only idiots think this is a good thing. To be fair Castorice's passive itself is not broken. The issue is that it now sets the standard for more passives to be added. What's to stop Hoyo from adding a character with a crit global passive or a speed boost?
"To me it helps everybody out. Its a free revive, and thats literally it. Its not too broken either, as you need someone to heal or shield the revived unit, otherwise they just get downed again.

If it did something more influencial then it'd be bad, but its just a revive that requires extra steps."
Why it's an issue? It's not a PVP games like LOL or Dota because HSR is a Gacha games why not understand? Cas passv is just related to her lore
"That ""lore accurate"" argument is so shallow.. I mean if we're going with ""lore accuracy"" then most 5 star characters should be able to clear end game content with ease because a lot of them are crazy powerful.. Welt alone should be able to kill everybody"
idc but im pussling her cuz she looks so badass and i love her color and effects
Oh wait. People are still dying?
At the end of the day.. you still get to decide who to pull.. no one is forcing you to pull for her..
I wouldnt complain about it - my weak ahh dies too many times 😂😂😂
Skill issue
Who care. I get her cause she pretty. Not her boobs....
"Both Castorice and Anaxa are a must pull, Casto because og her Global Passive, and Anaxe because of his 7 weakness implants"
I don't care about the passive but don't get me started on making lore accurate character
"Some will not understand why this is bad
until it's in characters they don't want to pull"
Does it really count as pay to win if your not going against other players
If this game had pvp...
But the fact that Hoyo is considering and even implementing global buffs is terrible. And will likely set precedents for future characters.
" @felixwang447  My thing is just that this is a single player game. It's still player choice on pulling for any character. They can certainly help you play, yeah. But you don't need to have characters with global passives to beat enemies or just play the game."
"Making the game pay to win?  Oh honey, it's been that way since it's conception"
"It's not even that bad since when have  you actually needed a revive for one character and even when you do, you can just restart and hope for better rng luck"
Bai Lu : oh...
"Did any Chinese players complain? because we all already know that global players will never got their attention anyway even if majority of the player complain. If Chinese player kept silence about this, well... let's just say that Castorice is just the beginning"
"It wasnt as broken as people say, the char will still die even after revives, 
If you want to say broken, mydei is even more broken, can revives more times than you think"
"Good lord, HSR players are so whiny and full of crybabies 🤏🏻"
"Absolutely pointless pasive, if your chatacter dies,
Thats a skill issue e.e"
"I think Castorice should be free for everyone
Especially for F2P and new players"
"Save and pull or play better, ig. No arguments on either side have enough ground or reasonability to sway the other

Like every disagreement ever"
I had no issue until I heard it works even if she isn’t in the party. That’s basically now a whole new mechanic that having her gives. That is 100% unfair and pay to win if you ask me.
Global passives are the death of this game. Awful idea
"Everyday i wake up following gacha social medias o disappoint myself a bit more both from watching and getting people to view me as this thrashbag community. Note: in reality most of the comunnity is fine, the ""dark side"" is mainly X and social media people."
"I think is not to bad remember the only character can revive party only Bailu as I remember and this game we cannot use items to revive party, I play turn base RPG and always have party members get knock out so with Castorice passive ability I can use party one turn, her ability only make party have one turn after that they knock out but if you use heal to that members they not knock out so if there no healer in your party game over for real"
"This pasive is basicly useless, if my character can die i obvliously cannot make it in end game content. Becaus you need a certain amount of dmg withing a certain amount of turns."
I support castorice passive since the game already has too much hp inflation and f2p can’t even finish floor 10 MoC without too much farming and the bosses have high dmg and speed which gives them many chances to kill you plus ppl need to have speed boots on all their characters to keep up with the bosses and will lower their attack because of it
The revive from castorice is not the problem why people are mad but the fact that GLOBAL PASSIVES are gonna become p2win like...Global passives for extra SPD/Crit/DMG/ER/BREAK EFFECT and so on.... but revive is like meh
"normally, if it not work on endgame contents, no one will care abt this, but no it does"
"Global passives are now a thing. Its no matter a matter of if they will ruin the game, but when."
"At first I was all chill till you said ""...even not in the team.'"
"Excuse ""not in the team""? How tf is that even allowed??"
and just like that they will create a ton of gp skills like this and even more broken
I feel like people are way too heated by this. Like I'm not pulling for castorice but like its not that big of a deal imo. People keep using the slippery slope fallacy to say this is setting a precedence but like idk.
"For me, I'd say i wouldn't mind the feature as long as it can't be activated in moc, pure fiction and all that type of content"
"This revive is just mid most of the times if you die at moc 12 you still gonna die even with this revive
I only scared if this global buffs gonna give something like stat buff in future"
This forces nothing the game will be just as beatable with 4 stars as it always has 😮
It okay if we can use only one global passive
this is basically just the guts ability in FGO
"yes, because it's very much Pay to Win, it's disgusting"
Yall crying too much
"""P2W"", what exactly is WIN in this game? the story is easy to clear you don't have to pay. 
If it is clearing the Endgame modes, what is the reward? more pulls? is it worth it? I think not. (you can get at least half of the reward without paying anyway)
If you say getting your fav characters, I agree, so save your pulls and not be a meta slave so you win."
I'm still gonna use her so I don't rly care
So ppl bitching abt a bailu but better? Im getting her either way let the bitches bitch ive saved for her since mommy herta
I love the idea as well so all in all.. lore wise indeed
I got Mydei next is Castorice
"Warum sollte sie unverzichtbar sein? 
Schon mal endgame gespielt? Da geht es vorallem darum Gegner in einer bestimmten Anzahl an Runden zu besiegen, da hilft eine einmalige Wiederbelebung nichts, null."
Not for nothing but if you're dying in end game it's never just one character going down once. It's a novelty at best. Definitely not worth the hate. 🙄
"People who honestly believe her passive is P2W really don't know how to play the game lol. The only times I've ever failed a quest dying was in super high difficulty Divergent or Simulated Universe and because I had crappy luck with blessings and Curios. Yeah, she makes it somewhat easier, but so did Fu Xuan when she came out (And it's the same since she was ran in every single team regardless when doing high diff content)"
"lore accurate my ass.
Welt should be op as hell then. his power is controlling black hole"
"Its power creep like crazy. If it was lore reasons why not only make it affect the team shes on.

They are going to destroy the balan e of the game by introducing global passives and its already pretty poor as is."
Only 1 hp? Honestly bailu is better at that point. Just stack hp on her.
"Just stop crying. The game never forces you guys to spend money. If you guys don’t like it, just delete the game and find another games.

Don’t forget that HSR is free-to-play

Also, that passive isn't even overpowered. How is this pay-to-win? Lol? 😂

I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but stop blaming the game with unreasonable reasons

You guys must not forget that this is a gacha game. It's more enjoyable when you play it for the fun of summoning new favorite characters and leveling up the characters you summons.

Stop thinking about character performance"
"“How is this pay to win” uh when your entire party gets one tapped and you get to keep playing is not something anyone else has, not even Bailu but ok buddy retarrd.
“Stop thinking character performance”, have you ever played a fucking strategy game? Without the right people you don’t win, and the goal is to idk win?
You licked toilets as a kid and it shows"
Hey.. just win
"Since they haven't changed it, I believe we can expect more future Global passive units and where we can select which one passive from the bunch to make it balanced."
Just shut up dude you keep repeating the same thing over and over again.
"I, for one, will be getting her regardless. I am a huge fan of the character and i am actually in the market for a Quantum DPS. 😊"
if you okay with her being lord of death then in after this they will create lord of power with plus dmg to you team if you get that character
I won't pull for her. I just pulled the orange cat😅 I'm broke now😂
"meh, its mostly gonna affect new players, endgame nolife-ers with good stats 0 cycle aint gonna notice the difference"
"I dont care actually, i wanna donate all x2 packs to her e2r1 just cuz she is pure poor girl who deserves all hugs and headputs she want"
So Bailu doesn't exist now??? Seriously no one remembers her???
"If we want to make everything so lore accurate then make Blade revive every time he's downed and make almost all of the Xianzhou characters follow the path of the hunt...
It's not Castorice's global passive that's the problem but the global passives in general. The first isn't really strong but what will the tenth global passive be? Bonus 50% crit dmg? Bonus 30% health? Don't be so naive to think that hyv can keep the powercreep under control atp."
"Bru no matter how her lore looks in the game, that's no excuse to ruin the flow of the game, that passive is not good at all, we wouldn't mind if it was only effective when she's in the team, but that's too much"
so that literally means if you combine her with bailu she is pay to win immediately
Its not even full hp why is people complaining
A gacha game being pay to win? Couldn't be
"Scamvidia for gaming ❌
Amd for gaming ✅"
"Nothing here is pay 2 win castorice is only 2nd char that can do that. We basicaly have simular mech since day 1. Bailu can do same thing also once to a single ally and even better at C6 she can do it 2 times, SO for Me that is nothing broken ir overpowered. Plus castorice constinatly consuming entire teams hp while bailu focuses on healing SO į think that balances everything. And thia iš my personal veaw on this. Little kids stop ruin the games with your crying all the f***ng Time, becose off it even voice actors in games quiting they jobs even thou its not they problem. insted of crying spend some time to invest in games and gather some gems to pull for favorite chars that way u dont need to cry every single faking Time that u cant pull since castorice was known to everyone that she be on realese on 3.2 patch from new region released so u had many Time to gather gems for her and get her for free. I personalu have already over 20k ofc have to skip 2chars but thats ok for Me. Anyway kids stop cry and play the games ir u dont play and only cry dont play at all."
"If they die in MOC 12, one revive won't make the game easy for them :>"
"Would've 100% pulled for this character. Now I'm definitely not, disgusting precedent."
So it's basically like bailu but worst
So it's just like that dragon healer on the standard banner
castorice + bailu 😂
"Can someone explain the deal with this because why are people cryong over a passive that is lore related, it not like they will do this every patch like the acheron or fexiao ultimate because i saw some ""what can stop them adding 15%res penetration"" like how they will make this lore accuret ???"
"I have a doubt  !!!
Does castorice need speed below 92  ?
If healer or any harmony character increases speed of all other members 
Then crit stat will be lossed or not ?

Pls help !!!"
OP? I mean most of my team are built not to die so castorice passive doesnt even work for 80 -90 percent of my teams. I guess it will be good if something happens that was unexpected but its not broken if I build my teams to stay alive anyways
"This passive isn't even going to be much of an effect. If you need the passive to do any form of content, I'm pretty sure you have bigger problems. And yes, it sets a bad precedent, future passives may be even worst, but that's for the future. Enjoy what you have now instead of worrying about a future possibility. And if you quit because of this, good. You simply wanted to quit for a long time, and didn't have a big spark to make it happen."
Like....Just skip her if u don't want your game to be too easy?
"Cas global passive is bad for the future, it's fine if cas passive revive 3 teammates, 1 for each teammate, this makes her different from standard character bailu"
"""What if's? Drama"" you guys has no life or something? Fighting over this kind of thing? Just play the game. If you dont like it , stop playing. Simple."
"Personally i welcome this mechanic, i mean when was the last time we have a character capable of reviving others"
"They feel it is a must to get her because it makes end game easier, meaning that it can still be done without her.  Which means that her situation is the same as any other new character, where they make end game content easier due to power creep.  It is only a problem if her global passive is MANDATORY to beat end game and not a luxury."
"We’re upset cause even if u think this passive doesn’t bust the game (it absolutely does) theirs the fact that little things pile up over time into big things. Now it’s just a revive mechanic. But Tmrw it’s gonna be +45% crit dmg if you pull this support unit. Then it’s gonna be + 100% crit rate on ultimates & now you can’t even beat MoC 8 cause the bosses have been HP inflated to account for dps units with 110% crit rate & 345% crit damage.
This ruins the game. This isn’t fun."
"There is no thing such as must have. You don't like it, skip it =]]]"
"I'm confused, can anyone tell me what global passive is and what's wrong with it?"
They should've put it on a male character. I'm ready to see the pitchforks LOL
"Can we not all just agree that her global should have stayed strictly while she is in battle? There was literally 0 reason for it to be global when not even Bailu's, Fu Xuan's or Scooby Doo's are global... (also to me, her even just having a revive is stupid. Why does the girl that brings death REVIVE teammates. Should've stayed with her sacrificing a teammate instead)"
It honestly doesn't bother me
"We are going to have even more global passives in the future, because they did this with Castorice."
"Sorry to disappoint but they are making money based on the sales of people buying stellar jade and battle passes and such, it's already free to download and they give you free characters in events but at the end of the day money is what keeps the quality of graphics, design of characters and the gameplay, and how they pay their voice actors and other staff. If you're looking for something that you download for free and want a completely free to play game then your looking at a perfect world that doesn't exist. Get real people."
She's not wildhunt heathcliff bro 😭
"I mean, baizu exists"
"Fr idk why they crying about this, plus the global passive have to be related to the lore but they think that a character can in the futur give 15% dammage boost because of a passive like how they will make this lore accute ? They just gonna add 1 passive a years but no they crying over something that is not op"
bailu?
"Yeah, we might have not gotten a revive character in a while, but i still think global passive will just completely screw everything over. They should’ve limited it to her team, and we would still have a revive character."
"Yeah, it's pretty unique and I like it if it's just a fun immersive mechanic related to the character's lore. As long as it doesn't become strong/too good that it's a necessary....."
"@fazexd2637  I'm not sure about Castorice lore but the interesting story about her revive mechanic, I believe is tied to the legend she is based on which is Castor and Pollux. You should look it up, it's quite an interesting read and it makes her global passive more sense"
So Bailu just doesnt exist? No offense.
" @pixelated_gamers1069  technically the last character who can revive others is Fu Xuan, if you E2 her but abundance path wise is Bailu"
Fr like you don't speak 80-180 pull for MoC because you want 80 jades
Hoyo trying to ruin their game again 😓
You're a massive restarted detergent if you defend this slop.
"The funniest part to me, watching all of this controversy around Castorice’s Global Passive, is the people saying that Global Passives are going to be must pull characters, when in reality, there’s absolutely no basis or reasoning that supports this. There might be if the game had ANY kind of competitive nature, like PvP or Leaderboards, but it’s DOESN’T! You’re not competing with ANYONE, no one else who has 8 global passives is going to affect your gameplay, and I guarantee that you will not fall behind in MoC or any of the endgame modes in the long run if you skip Castorice for a future character, or any other global passive characters that follow. 

Stop comparing yourself to other people’s accounts, and play the game for fun. If you want to use the character, pull them, and if you don’t, then don’t! It REALLY IS that simple!"
it might work lore wise but this means that hoyo will make more specific skill characters you must pull for. and since they lock some important stats you need for a character to function properly behind eidolons this will get even worse with specific characters you need to pull. its the greedy practices that hoyo is adding to the game which is the issue
Great ability. Should have only been active with her in team tho
"BRO THE PASSIVE okay on paper sounds broken but in actuality and in practice isnt strong/good BE REAL WHATS THE CHANCES OF YOUR HEALER/SHIELDER GOING BEFORE YOUR DPS THAT GOT DOWN ur basically screwed so you get 1 extra attack and more so then likely, youll have used your shielders or healera ult already trying to survive the huge attack"
"but when acheron gets a passive that allows her to skip battles and is to this day the most ridiculous ""p2w"" quality of life, no one bats an eye. And when a dps absolutely requires another unit to function like Jq to Ach, or Sunday to JY/Aglaea, etc.. thats not a problem either.. oh and lets not forget that this game asks upwards to $2k for any unit just to powercreep them in a patch...
but yeah, its this new ""passive"" that's the issue.. oh its such a big problem whatever shall we do in this GACHA GAME, the entire fking system is a disgrace to gaming and we all support it, but nooo its the passive that's the problem.. BOIII STFU
this is only a ""problem"" cause CCs that no longer play the game still want to create drama around it and yall have no opinion of your own so u go and parrot them. Just play the game or uninstall, crying about it won't do anything"
"Guys it’s not just about this passive or the ones after it, remember that the devs is looking into making a coop/ pvp gamemode, and god knows what that may bring about…"
"As I said before
""But the precedent 😭""
I will not review bomb a game for a ""it might happen""
And no one is forcing you to pull her like, if you already found dificult to survive in MoC it might be a good time to get good at the game lol"
I don't really care what's going on. She's cute so I am pulling for her.
"Cant wait for ""The Acheron"" with global passive to one shot every enemy. Lore accurate as thay said."
Castorice is gonna be broken
"if this meta trend only apply on hoyogames...idc...go ahead make more global passive...but the thing make me worry is...when people normalise this kind of passive...the other gacha company will started follow the trend just to boost the revenue...and later on there will always character that u must pulls even tho u dont like it
that what im worryin...idc what happen to hsr but i do care what will happen to other gacha games"
"While its a powercrept, it wasn't that broken and they created a characters for you to get bro."
"I already decided to pull her before knowing the global thing. I just want a  quantum damage dps, my current dps is que-que😅."
"Ah yes, lets hate on the op power of a literal DEMIGOD. And let's also compare her to seele, an 18 yo mortal girl that doesn't have proper education, lives in the slumps with not much food, learn to fight from just surviving and can swing a pretty big scythe like Castorice. It's so bs that people ignore the background of a character and only care about the end strength of said character. Like what's next, you're going to compare Nanook the AEON of DESTRUCTION against Clara a child and called it power creep just because they are both destruction characters?"
"Man you dont need the character tho....they aint forcing you😭my black swan, Archon, healer dude 4 star and kafka still got me up to date n im fine😭😭😭"
But it’s only once per battle lol
It’s not even PvP…
I think if she has to be on the squad it is more than ok idk why they are crying every 5 minutes its F2P
Explain because i just don't care about this passive but you guys are creating drama over a meh passive so i want to know why you guys are mad ? For me this will likely add global passive for strong lore accute character so one a years plus i hear a lot of people tell what if they add 15%  attack buff bu who they will make this lore accute. At the end there is no must pull like DU can be clean with every character and you just don't spend 80-180 pull to get 80 Jade from MoC
I just want you or someone to explain me what the deal like really because i really just saw you guys like this 🦧🤓☝️
"BRO THIS CLOWN IS LITERALLY DEFENDING THIS CRAP! Yeah, you people are cooked."
"I rly dont understand all the hate. Like ofc they have to make unique characters, and besides its not even that op its only once per battlr and most of the time 1 revive is not gonna be a game changer. And if the character is bad players cry and if the character is unique and good players cry like wtf"
"THAT'S IT?? my god I need to get used to this level of powercreep, I've been traumatised by my game's power creep 💀"
"just pull lol, the inflation aint gonna wait for you buddy bois. the only thing that can be a monetized by these games are the hype around these characters, so to keep the game engaging, they need to bump up the enemy's health and release characters that follow through their with they hp inflation. its not like there is that much of a skill ceiling to begin with, only speed tuning and orders. not like genshin and zzz where you can dodge and shi, the devs know full well what these powercreeps do, and the engage in it fully, its just that there is so many crybaby's that still wants their half built seele to clear moc 12. this game is a GACHA game, i would even go as far to say that the skill in HSR is just to plan your teams, and plan who to pull. as i said, not a hack and slash, not a adventure game, a gacha turn based game."
"For me, this is awesome 😎👍"
"if they don't like it they should quit , easy , get out of the game lol"
"revive with 1 hp is not broken, its practically useless, what is a problem is adding other characters with actual broken passives that make whole teams viable or not based on who you whaled for."
she only powercreep bailu
It might be bugged
That's it?
"well i have to smash things on the way to craft healing items to it's a plus, and i pray that they have an ""off"" switch"
"Wait there’s a fucking meta in star rail? Dude I haven’t touched the game in ages and I come back and try to play, no wonder why I’m struggling so hard"
"Bailu does the same, but she must be alive AND not froze/stun"
How about.. we don’t pay for castorice? 😀😀
I'm glad Hoyo didn't listen to the minority complaining to make the global passive like Bailu only..
"Y’all are just crying at this point, now when they try to nerf it people will accuse hoyo of weakening the characters so much just like accept what they’re giving you bru nobody cares if you don’t want her then don’t pull? If you really don’t like it then don’t pull for her why are y’all just so mad at the dumbest thing"
"this is absurd, Bailu has the same passive ability and it’s fine?"
"People are saying ""powercreep"" and stuff... And yet, people forget that Mydei just can't die on his own. 😂"
"Would be good if every 5 star a unique passive, and can only have 1-3  passives on"
People who don't like it must not be guaranteed in the 50/50
"I mean... Why not just make the skill activate WHEN CASTORICE IS IN THE TEAM? I mean okay, revive mechanic on her is aligned with her lore but man... They don't need to make it a global passive."
if its lore acc then give her for free like XD cuz in lore she is in our team type shit yes idea is good but not in damn gacha with things like MoC or stuff like that XDD
"A chacter is bad like mydei:omg why is he so bad skip!!!
A chacter is good like castorice:omg shes too op why did hoyo make this/:(
If yall cant like bad chacter and cant like good chacters what do you want hoyo to do"
"all people who complain about her passive still bound to pull her anyway
Global passive is bad because ""what if"" think thats what you call a slippery slope"
"Great feature, but not in a live service game."
Lol she just revive with 1 hp lol 😆 how is ut broken
Imagine saying p2w in a single player game
NAH I DONT WANT MY WALLET GO TO HEAVEN DAWG 😭🙏
"The thing is her passive wouldnt allow you to do endgame content any easier as you think... she doesnt revive you permanently so you need to heal them or give them shield or the character would still be downed (theres a butterfly icon beside the character health bar), this mean that you cant even run a sustainless team comp at all unless your blade who can heal your self or mydei with his ultimate, its not as broken as people think its pretty balance for a global passive because 1 it doesnt allow you to run a crazy sustainless run without a worry, 2 it doesnt effect the damage of your character because its not a buff towards damage. this doesnt make her a MUST MUST PULL rather supports like JQ is far more valuable than her and is a even more must pull than her, you dont necessarily need her passive what you need to fix or help your account is proper invested supports, invest in them thats what will help you clear end game content not just casto






Anyways thats my personal opinion  i dont like whats coming for the future but i also dont hate her since shes not as broken as people may make her seems to be..."
"Tbh I wouldn’t mind if they do one of these things.

1. Make Castorice free to everyone

2. If global passive it should only be anniversary characters

3. With a global buff they should give her a global debuff as well and to turn off the debuff you must turn off the buff.


4. Just don’t add it."
"Nah… I have Bailu, and she does the perfect job that way. That cute dragon lady literally saved the Master Diviner during Nikador’s battle."
"the global passive is not the main reason that forces player to pull for new characters and making this game a p2w game, the inflation of enemy health is."
This is like Mydei immortal passives at E0 again-
"Both statement is correct, I'd rather it works like Bailu revive tho rather than global"
Yes it’s not op but that’s not the point…the point is that now that they have introduced “Gobal passive” what the fuck makes you think they won’t be doing it again for other characters
"Its basically useless without healing or shields, and if you have that then you shouldn't die"
"Future 5-star characters' passives be like:

Obtain 10 Stellar Jades per day. 😐😐😐"
Genshin 2.0 in coming
"I remember when this game first came out, i was excited about all the type of playstyles and tactics you could do by what you prefer (preseveration tanking, dps hunt, etc.), but now it's just powercreep and meta. Gonna get my anni rewards then uninstall until something draws me in enough cuz wuwa needs its space"
"Imagine being so bad at planning your pulls that you see getting a single copy of a character as P2W. Womp Womp, glad that Hoyo didn't flinch and this passive makes it into the game"
I don't even care I like her design so I pull
"And the global passive will have a pretty big chance of the devs making the inflation of enemy health even worst so it kinda is, even if it's indirect."
"You’re blaming global passives for a problem they didn’t cause. Castorice’s passive boosts survival, not damage, it doesn’t contribute to HP bloat at all. Your claim just doesn’t hold up. Assuming the devs will abuse global passives for monetization is pure speculation. Focus on what’s actually broken, not what you think might happen. Game development is a gradual process. If future global passives do include offensive utility, that’s a balance issue, not proof of malicious intent. Enemy HP inflation is real. Global passives aren’t the problem, they’re just support tools that got better."
"@ You're talking about ""monetization"" and ""malicious intent"" when I never talked about it, I'm just telling that now that global passive exist, they will inevitably make some at some point that increase your damage output, and most likely not just once, and of course these global passive will be taken into account for the hp scalling and the player that did not get the character with said global passive won't just be able to summon the new character to have the perfect dmg output to go against the hp scalling since they'll have missed a certain amount of damage scalling global passive.
Also I know global passive didn't create the hp scalling problem, but they will 100% make it worst (except if the dev decide to not take global passive dmg up when making the hp scalling, but it's more of a dream than what will happen)"
"You surely didn’t mention monetization, but I did, because that was my original point: p2w is driven by HP inflation, not global passives.

Then you say you didn’t mention malicious intent, but you’re literally assuming future global passives will boost damage; assuming devs will scale HP around them; and assuming that players who skip them will be permanently behind. Zero evidence, pure speculation. That is implying malicious intent, just with extra steps.

That’s like saying, ""I’m not accusing the school of scamming kids, I just know they might eventually make calculators mandatory and then might as well start selling overpriced calculators, and the kids who don’t buy them will probably fail math, so we better blame them now before that happens.”

Global passives existing doesn’t guarantee they’ll boost damage or be used to justify HP inflation. That’s a textbook slippery slope. Yes, we should call out bad balancing — when it happens. But until a global passive actually breaks HP scaling, you’re blaming the rain before there’s even a cloud. Crying wolf over what might happen only derails real discussion."
The hsr community (some) complain about EVERYTHING. Like damn Hoyo give you more rerun banners y'all complain about it having too many banners when YOU asked for it. you don't have to pull on every banner chill tf out. Now y'all complain about the global passive. Okay? just skip it you don't have to pull for her she's just lore accurate. Some of y'all is just unbelievable.
"Dawg😭 bailu can do that too, and she’s the worst healer😭🙏"
People haven't heard of reruns?
The video really fails to mention that if the character that gets downed and  gets revived by her passive ISNT healed or shielded afterwards. They will still die again. Forcing you to have sustains so sustainless runs arent possible with her.
"So, no one talks about jingliu and stellaron hunter buffs?"
Just change it so it only works when she is in the party and it's fine 😅
"I dont see the problem, its just like every new character in genshin"
"""New power creeped enemies=New power creeped characters"" isnt this normal at turn based games or do i mistake something."
"Uh… bailu also does that, you just need her in the team."
"Ngl Idc how it works, as long as the game is still playable."
She was already a must pull as soon as the dragon came out and put that Godzilla blast on the enemies. It’s a single player game and she isn’t a must pull for reviving someone.  People need to stop whining all the time.
Imagine dying in hard content
"I think they nurfed her passive so that it is balanced.. People who think this is pay to win are stupid and probably keep dying.. I swear if castorice gets revamped she WILL STILL get hated by the freaking community.. I have a feeling that almost all members of this fandom are children😭

""Just lore accurate, don't cry"" Nice."
Bro the 7 deadly sins has worse passvies how is this unfair like in the 7 deadly sevens game there is a passive that straight up makes everyone on the field take dmg if they don't attack
"It doesn’t force anything! I don’t care what her passive does, she’s a woman so I won’t pull for her."
"That's good if it's just once per battle, wtf why everybody crying."
"Really, is this what breaks the camel's back? Are you guys fucking kidding me? The herta can use her technique to find chests, right? Well, it'll be active regardless if she's on the team or not. It's significantly more op than castorice's global passive since it simply feeds you jades for free, sorry to sound rude, but you guys are fucking stupid, if this is what's considered ""too far"" than why complain now? Why boycott now? Smh... besides, it's a one-time revive for each unit per battle, which barely even matters, since, if a unit managed to have died once already, then clearly, the chance that they'll die again is just as high as the first death."
"The passive itself is not broken at all. I don't know what y'all are doing, I can't recall the last time anyone on my teams has died. The problem is that it opens the door for other, more powerful passives later on."
"Honestly, if you need revives to beat endgame content, then maybe you shouldn't touch the endgame content and just stick to story mode."
I dont see it as a bad thing with a good sustain you team will not die anyway like sure if one get killed and get revive is strong they shouldn't be dying in the first place
"Just so you understand the complain about the her global passive, well first it's not about the effect because it's kinda ass, if a character just revive with 1 hp then everything can kill it immediatly after so it could be usefull but it most likely won't.
The problem is the idea of a character buffing your team EVEN when it's NOT in your team, for now it's not a big deal because the effect is bad but when a character will come out with a global passive that add attack% or crit chance% or crit damage% or anything that help do more damage then it'll be a bigger problem.
And if you still don't see the problem, then think about multiple global passive of that caliber stacking, and how the devs will try to balance monster hp, and then realise that most people won't have all of them and the hp scalling will be impossible to go through if you don't put money in the game, or even if you put just a little bit of money but not enough."
 @siphons5737  I am aware of all that you are saying and the fact that people are mad about the idea of the global passive but that's not what i'm trying to convey if you read all of the message. I said that when the hoyo com wanted more banners for their favorite characters hoyo included multiple banners of characters for multiple versions for the com to pull and some of you still complained about it. In simple terms if you don't like what's going on in the game just simply quit if you don't like what they're making or you deal with whats going on. that's the only options i'm seeing. but at the end of the day your still playing the game aren't you? and  obviously they aren't changing it and it's already confirmed no use in complaining about it anymore. Plus you can still play the game and clear endgame rewards without her.
"@Mistaplays-s8d For your first point, yes I did, that's why I specifically said ""the complain about her global passive"", not ""why people complain in general"". Also, people are allowed to be annoyed and express the thing that they find annoying (not that I understand it for the multiple 5* banners but don't except people to not complain)

For your second point, people like a game for it's entirety, not just the gameplay, and that's the same thing for Star Rail, people partly like it for the gameplay yes, but also for the characters, the story, the worldbuilding, the scenery... So yes people won't just stop playing because of a thing that is getting sligtly worst/has the potential on becoming a problem, however they might do if the hp scalling become such a problem that the fight become more frustrating than anything (and the idea of global passive can and will surely worsen the hp scalling problem), and they won't stop feeling relieved or happy, but sad that they can't keep experiencing all the other part of the game that they still love because of the gameplay.

If you want me to use an example that isn't game, then let's take food, think of your favorite food, or at least one of your favorite food, imagine then than in the near future an ingredient needed (and can't be replaced) for said food start to become more and more expensive, even with that price being bigger and bigger you'll still want to eat that food since it's one you love, however you won't be able to eat it as much as you want until one day the ingredient is too expensive for you to buy. At that point you'll have to stop eating that favorite food and you will feel sad that you might never be able to re-experience such a great food ever again.

Now let's replace the ""ingredient"" by ""the fights"" in star rail, the ""price"" by ""the frustation"" given to you by the game and the ""love"" by ""the enjoyment"" given to you by the game, do you understand a bit better why people complain and not just stop playing ?

(also I don't know where to put that but you said at the end ""you can still play the game and clear endgame rewards without her"" and I answer to you that the problem is not her, the problem is the potential bigger problem that will happen when new characters with a global passive will arrive and said passive upgrade damage of your characters and stacks with older ones, and that is one thing I already said)"
"@siphons5737  Okay, I totally agree and understand what you're saying, but like hoyo gon do Hoyo, they don't really listen to the community that much anyway  like they should. They should also follow  Kuro games example like if you play wuwa then yk how Kuro do but anyways I'm prob still gonna pull for her bc i love her animations and designs so..yea..and i also think hsr players are mostly likely to boycott the banner cus of the global but if you really think about it like you said it is ass 😔. But thanks for explaining. I was just being stupid. Forgive me for my ignorance 😭😭🙏🙏"
"@Mistaplays-s8d Boycotting won't do anything, I saw some people in that comment section say that there were leaks with other character with global passive so boycotting would amount to nothing (and even if it could, the amount of people that would entirely stop playing [that's what boycotting is, not just not pulling] wouldn't be a lot compared to people that would keep playing because they either don't care or just don't follow news and just wait to be surprised pleasently by the game).
And I'm probably gonna do the same, I prepared a team for her 1 patch ago before I knew anything of her kit and I kinda don't want it to go to waste so yeah (+ I like the character and it's enough of a reason to pull)"
 @siphons5737  Wait fr I didn't know they were other characters with a global  passive.
"@Mistaplays-s8d For now it's ""leaks"" so I don't know how correct it is, but even without leaks it's obvious they wouldn't just stop with 1 character"
isn't this hoyo trying to help everyone by trying to not powercreep too much? like i'm sure more future characters will have global passives. and then one day you get that character and think this is nice. and you'll be contradicting yourself
Does it mean that I can finally die for once? I forgot what the animation looks like already
"To be honest, yes it's OP but I don't think it's essential. It's not like the game suddenly becomes impossible if you don't have Castorice. There are people one-cycling the hardest game content out there. It's not like they needed her either."
"What ya mean complaining to a game about it being pay to win while having a gatcha system? You’re upset because you can’t have it, it’s part of life anyways not all people can get to have a free vila."
😭if u dont want cassie then pull for other characters no one's forcing them to pull geez
"well this global passive aint so broken, literally revives you 1 hp and BAM hoolay destroys you again"
"I think Castorice global buff is pretty useless, and she isn't must have, but if Hoyo will develop global buffs..."
People like to cry
“Seems” to make the game pay to win. It’s a gacha game. The whole idea behind it is pay to win. But I do think global passives are not going to be healthy for the game
Why are people acting likes they are being forced to get her 😭
"Don’t take twitter ppl seriously, they always find something to argue about"
Bruh if you dont wantbthat character why bother pulling? Just stop the hating
"I personally don't see this being an issue, i mean most people don't let there characters die anyway. I do concede though that it could be a sign of global passives being made to strong and game difficulty being changed because of those but if they keep it simple these could be a fun addition. Either way im not calling out doom until I see it as a huge problem."
"If you pull, you pull. Don't wanna, don't. I see no issue."
"It's not even that important, with sustain and meta team, you can't even die that easily. With or without Castorice is not saving you from endgame content, it saving you from Divergent Universe🫠"
"Honestly as a casual who has seen enough with the controversy, seeing how much I'm struggling with new bosses I'm not complaining at all. I feel like too many people are overreacting to this 🤨"
Broken or not. Castorice is waifu. Pull who you want. Don't pull for meta. Pulling for meta will make the game no longer fun. Pull characters that you want and enjoy. I will pull Castorice because waifu.
"It could bring more passives that really break the game, like idk a character that gives you crit damage even if not in the party or something"
even if she wasnt so op or if she wasnt a new character or a 5* i would still pull for her i really like her desing
"What the, even if not on team? @0@"
"You’re not getting the point. Castorice is a sign of what’s to come, if one character has global passives then more will have them too. 

We don’t want that"
"Exactly, a lot of people need to learn to read. This kind of thing always comes with a handicap built in. (also, if you don't want that passive, just don't pull for her)"
Full dps team will be meta now😂
"They say ""Forces"" they're just stupid, they aren't being forced to pull for her"
Funny thing ill stop playing most gacha by september the only game i still play is wuwa and epic 7 i need to focused on my game list to play ive been putting a lot of game on hold
People cry a lot lol
My unpopular opinion or view of point of mine in this mechanic is castorice being too powerful that she powercrept everyone it kinda makes me sad but revival with or without her LETS GO
"I feel like it was a coding accident 
Most gameplay coding doesn't need to be checked with the character off field
So it could've been an accident that can't be fixed until the next game version/update
It's not that deep"
"It's literally like having 4 Bailu passives at once, one per character.
It also opens the door for even more broken global passives in the future. It's ridiculous."
"People who still lickings hoyo shoes don't even think that is the ""start"" global buff character that literally makes everyone need the character because you don't even need to bring the character, 

imagine in the future you can't progress because you need this character that has a global buff that blocks 1 time lethal damage because the enemy gimmick is wiping your team if you can't clear dps check 😂"
yall just mad
The gacha game is pay to win? Really? Omg I never realized that the game were I can drop 600 dollars to get ez mode was pay to win. Man these devs are out of their mind man let me tell you
"If global passive buff shows up only on anniversary that'll be ok to me actually, but atleast give it to eminators so its more lore accurate and makes sense"
"does not matter, I will pull her even she doesn't have such an ability... On the contrary, I won't pull it even there is such a cheat but it's a male character..."
"Let's be honest, if you are downed and revived with 1 hp, your complete lack of skill/luck still won't save you."
Pay to win? The game is PVE.
"why are people being too cheesy, just look at the gameplay later, it definitely won't be that op because the system is directly resurrected and many enemies have 2-3 atk/turn which may or may not be very useful. the endgame content also requires that there is no party that ""falls"". im using google translate XD"
Castorice Is the new bailu
"Review bombing won’t help lol. That will just make them commit to global passive buff because they would think that Castorice is not popular enough rather thinking she’s too broken. Because to hoyo, Castorice doesn’t seem broken and her global passive is not broken. 
The problem everyone is having right now, isn’t because she’s broken but because people are worried that future characters will have global passives as well. 
However this won’t be an issue if Hoyo never releases another global passive character. So we can only see if Hoyo will only make Castorice the only global passive character."
I'm still going to pull for her anyway when she has her first leak. 🌟 I was determined to pull for her even when her first leak was leaked; I didn't know she had that global passive. 🤔✨
but，it is pay to win game.
"People really thinking power up = good 😂
If they introduce this gimmick, better put it in archivment or something so people can grind for this"
Skill issues
"Bro when you 3 star floor 12 of MOC, you are not suppose to have a down character. Everyone be like “oh no, I keep dying”"
There another healer that does almost the same thing. Bui but as long as she is alive. People are blow shit out of portion.
"How is it p2w when just because you have character which can revive other characters doesn't mean that you will get strong 😂 and plus if you have a good sustain which can also do damage doesn't that do the trick.
So ya rather stressing over somthing like this just go and stress about how to build your other characters 
(Ps. Hsr is the only action rpg I have played so don't know if my opinion is relevant)"
HSR is still 4.5 on App Store on my phone
"The buff Itself is fine but now that w have the global buff, they will probably do it with other character an knowing HSR the piwercreep will be SO BAD. Like the next global I
Which I hope w neve get could probably be like  a crit rate and damage buff to every character. Like that should never be a thing unless everyone has free access to it"
free anaversari character
they thould give her for free
"Last year with Acheron the complaints about the novelty of the ultimate without energy was that it left the characters focused on giving energy (HuoHuo, Tingyun) useless and it was to implement another type of powercreep. This year there was going to be no shortage of complaints about the annual novelty, no matter what they released, there were going to be cries anyway."
Not gonna lie its really a must character especially in this inflation. I still going for Hyacine tho. Don't get me wrong i really like Castorice because she remind me of Griseo. But i gonna pass and get Hyacine. I will get Castorice in her rerun.
Have fun with compulsory pulls with global passive or you'll ruin your account by not getting stronger. Bunch of stupid losers who are still playing HSR.😂😂😂😂
"Im pretty sure any gacha developer can tell you that this just goes against all common sense, selling AN ACCOUNT PERK disguised as a character and pretending its not predatory or incentive to further break your game's balance. HSR's powercreep is just objectively bad after this, its gotten so un-enjoyable to play over time and this just seals it for me. I probably won't even come around for the anniversary because this game's future is doomed.

The story sucks, the characters suck and have the most repetitive designs in any Gacha I've seen (wow another girl in halter top dress with exposed armpits/shoulders and detached sleeves/arm acessories but in new color) , the kits are terribly balanced, you cant play with your own personal favourites anymore with how drastically even the base game's new worlds demand you use the new characters at their release time, endgame sucks, nothing good here anymore"
"im f2p and im not mad at it, only whales are salty about this, when f2p pull for her for free 😅"
it would make sense if she was given out for free..
Why are people so mad about when hoyo does stuff to get revenue anyways they arent making the game for our fun they doin it for moneu
If you die then it's just skill issues
So basically its like bailu but broken?
People who calling it lore accurate shut your damn bs up. Idk why you all keep begin slaves to Hoyo but this is what you get for playing the game of a company which wouldn't give 2 damns about any of you expect for the whales who spend thousands upon thousands on the games like fools and waste their life savings.
"Guys nothing forces you to Get a character, Meta sucks just pull whoever you want 
And for rewards ..' they suck too don't bother much and go play Cookie Run Kingdom ❤️🫶"
"they either fix it by giving her for free, or nerf the revive"
"this makes no sense. the whales are gonna get the character regardless, whereas f2p players who lose the 50/50 are cooked if they haven't been saving for patches"
the game makes not pulling meta characters increasingly difficult with all the hp inflation tho
"At first glance it looks broken on paper.

But then you start to list things down, works only once, and it only revives to 1 HP, this might not work very well when enemies are fast/multi turn with AOE and some priority targeting in their AI.

In the end this ability doesnt look all that potent, it can be a great situational failsafe/reversal mechanic but then again, its gonna be down to the enemy compsositions."
"I find it cringe in general how people let themselves be slaves of a game to the point something that they dont like dictates their mood. Clearing the MOC its just temporary satisfaction.  I cant even clear fully at all but im not crying over it. Ur not forced to spend but if u find reasons to spend ""Meta changing must have broken"" sounds like a u problem."
"A one hit point revive isn’t saving anyone, especially against hoolay lmao"
"im not against it or supportive of it

If you die in hsr then thats a skill issue, theres healers and shielders that do what they have to do. Her revive is so extra and somewhat useless/unecessary."
I say they give every character a unique global passive to balance it out some
"(""Lore accurate"") powrcreep is why I quit HSR since I kept getting soft locked without Jingliu."
"- likes castorice 
- castorice is insanely powerful
- has enough pity and pulls to guarantee her
- happy"
Now I don’t agree with most of the controversies but I agree with this one... it should not work when she is not in the team
"its just revive, surely its not really that must have if you dont want to pull for her or lost the 50/50... if you like her pull if not then no"
Then what is she supposed to do... This fits her per lore
even if it's coherant no character should have a passive that work outside of teams
I don't mind global passive but the fact that is something u get instantly without having to even invest in the units is a disappointment
I give a shi....t!!! 😊
"On one hand I want to skip her out of protest, on the other I've been planning to pull her since the first Amphoreous trailer dropped. I can't win."
It would be fine if it was only while she was in the team.
"Also, if she gets an effect out of feild, future characters will probably have it too but even stronger"
Please do NOT let these people play dragon ball legends if they think that's p2w
"If they wanted to make it ""lore accurate"" then having 1 revival while shes ON THE TEAM rather than a GLOBAL PASSIVE would make way more sense, stupid hoyo decisions killing their game yet again"
Complaining that a character is really really useful is absolutely batsh*t crazy to me.
"It’s not that the revive is broken but the possibility of new characters being able to provide account wide buffs
Eg new character giving account wide atk buff"
Bro really has no enemies. o7 🗿
"Maybe because there are people out there who don't want castorice? I mean the revive serves 0 purpose for veteran players, so it's not a huge deal rn. But if they incorporate global passive that boost account wide damage, my account will never see the light of day again"
I don't think it's much of use out side of her own team cuz if you're skill issue enough to die once.   You'll die again
"While the thought of a global passive can be a slippery slope, Castorices passive is pretty weak all things considered. It looks strong on paper but thats about it. Players who feel ""forced"" to pull for her because of it are just over exaggerating but we should still keep an eye on how they manage future global passives."
I honestly don't care about it I just think she's cool and her Dragon is legendary
laughs in bailu
"I mean.... if that is really it, it won't help much either as with 1 HP they still won't last longer than next enemy action unless right circumstances."
"Well, obviously its a cash grab. Whether or not hoyo genuinely wants Castorice being pulled for bc of some other obscure reason, money is still gonna come in."
"Yall, HSR is a pay to play game. Are we really surprised at this point"
just deal with it. its a video game lol
"Hsr players: nah, that's just straight up cheating
Barbara havers: wait you guys didn't have that?"
"This is a turn-based game, character get outdated quickly, i have no problem with those global mechanics bc they might be one way to keep the value of that certain characters, if you said something like ""then it become a must pull, what if i dont have the character,…"" its not like that the character is not gonna have a rerun, in fact, this game can have 2-3 characters rerun at the same time, probably more in the future. And, I KNOW this is a toxic take, if you feel like it ruined the game for you, then don’t play it, play something else, it is not worth it to invest your time into something that you don’t feel like it, especially games."
Okay?
"Bailu revives too no? Its not that overpowered,just usr hp scaling chars or a preservation/abundance unit😂"
its a single player game who really gives a fuck 😂
"I do find it a bit OP.
I think they maybe should have made it so that this passive would happen when she used her technique and lasting even after you'd change teams and until you'd kill the enemy, so you'd have to waste a technique point each time and so you couldn't make all teams you have in endgame content have it."
So if we have her and dragon healer we can get back up at least 2 times 🤔
HSR fell off so hard💀💀 just seeing the many shorts on the powercreep is making me glad i left
"I got a real question, Who are the players that wil benifit this Global passive? End-game players/ veterans? Heck no, like I'm pretty sure they won't get the chance to even use it since we would have clear the stage before that opputunity present itself.

This is only useful to New and Mid players that are still building up their 1st or 2nd team. just a bit of helping hands. Especially the ones complains about not having a strong healer/ shielder.

Another usage is in DU, especially on the higher difficulties.

If it really that much of a problem, might as well just have a toggle button to turn off the passive."
If you need this passive to clear end game content you got bigger issues on your account.
It's just a revive with 1hp a lot of time it's useless especially with 4 star Tingyun.
one time revive is no use unless you're in near victory situation so I'll say you make your team truly stronger that can tank hits and deal damage. then no death is even needed
"comments like this are why so many games go to shit and developers find themselves being lost and perpetually unsure about how to approach making changes to make their players happy, not that it really applies here because it's a gacha game eith predatory sysmtems in place that are designed to take your money, but I think the main concerns lie within the future of the game. Casotrice's passive serves absolutely 0 purpose as it stands, my issue would be if they add some bs like res pen, def down, attack or hp boosts account wide to a character I have 0 interest in. If that happens im quitting"

Barbara doesn't have a global passive
"This is a GLOBAL PASSIVE. She will revive you, even if she isn't in your team."
"​@Real-Quarlie just speed tune better in sustainless comps or throw on any limited sustain/gallagher and you beat the game with ease. This might be a hot take, but castorice's passive is completely useless if you've been playing for long enough to have 2 fully decked out teams consisting of at least a few recently released characters"
"@bepo1702  Even with just a revive, it's really strong to have it as a global passive. Instead of relying on sustain, you can now instead invest on pure damage a lot more. It being a permanent upgrade for every team is too strong.

But moreso, the bigger thing is the fact that this is just the developers testing the waters. If we don't complain about it now, they will add more global passives that may stretch even further.

What would you say when in a few months, we get characters with global passives buffing atk, or crit stats? And the endgame slowly more and more relies on people having those global passives?"
"​@Real-Quarlie I never claimed to think global passives were a good idea. Infact, I'll come out and say it right now. Global passives will be the death of the game at this rate, my entire point is that the revive itself is pretty useless for veterans or those with enough game knowledge. I can totally see hoyo adding res pen and def shred as global passives, or god forbid locking them behind eidolons 😂"
"I'm sure many people will give a fuck when they scale the endgame bosses hp wuth the assumption in mind that players have access to multiple global passives, since leaks suggest we're getting more. I refuse to play a game where I cant beat it because I don't have the global passive from a character I dont want/care about. The day they implement that is the day I quit for good 😂"
I still clear late game content with early characters
"Love how the argument is ""they're trying to boost revenue and make money"" ON A FREE GAME!!!!!!"
"""just lore accurate, don't cry""
Just cuz it's lore accurate doesn't mean it isn't p2w or fair at all"
"Basically, Bailu is now jobless. lol"
"I think its absolutely ass.
Sure this might be not toooo bad but this started something that will happen more in the future.
And powercreep in star rail is insanely crazy already, i can only imagine other characters in the future getting a global passive too getting more op over time until you run a team with 10 passive effects from characters you dont even use in battle.

I think this is really bad and it can lead into the worst game design ever if they go too crazy.
Lets pray they really think a lot about this and dont go too far."
I really don’t think it’s that strong unless if you’re a new player that doesn’t have a good team built or try to force a sustainless comp. The only bad thing is when global passives start power creeping
Like genuinely it makes me not want to pull for her. I love her design and animations and the dragon looks sick but the global passive seems like it will make endgame content trivial which makes the game boring. I’m less mad about it from a powercreep perspective but more that it’s just shitty game design.
"Both situations can be correct.

It can be a lore-accurate ability while also being a tactic Hoyo would pull to boost sales"
"Now zzz is the only good game for trashverse, lets see how it takes to also ruin that game lmao"
Look Castorice's global passive itself is not a big deal. The problem is. it opens the door for global passives!!! Imagine oh here if you pull this character then all your characters get a 15% crit rate. This is the problem that people have with this!!! If this stopped with Castorice then fine but we know this damn company won't stop with her!!!! And guess what other company's will follow in Hoyo footsteps and do the same sh*t.  Because if Hoyo can get away with this there gonna think that they can too.
"I didnt quit because of castorice, i quit because i pulled for the ""broken"" character came back a few months later and found out theres like 5 different characters that are leagues better than her"
That's why İ'm not playing hsr anymore
I meannnnn it's a JoJo's bizarre adventure part 3 stardust crusaders ref
I am just too excited for getting luoca for free 😂 i don't play the game that often anyway.
"Looks it's not about castorice having a revive since have a character that does that, it's the fact that it can also work when she's not even on the team. So you could technically never build castorice and every team has that revive. And to the players who are hoping that hoyo doesn't make upcoming global passives broken are dumbasses since we literally have examples where hsr introduced a mechanic and it changed the game in a negative way like the type res pen and implanting weaknesses. They started off small at first and later on every character has it and no longer does the game revolve around having teams that matches the enemy weakness. I'm starting to realize that hoyo makes games that has alot potential and later down the road they screw it up well unfortunately zzz is next."
how does it force anyone to do anything?
"You know you can just restart the battle anytime right? 
Imagine being unhappy over what happens inside a video game. 
With that said, I want to play with new & more Powerful characters, playing with same old characters gets boring"
I don't mind it as long as it doesn't count towards MOC the same way bailou revive doesn't count
Tbf the idea of global passive is weird
Lets be honest though. Was anyone really going to skip her? If you manage your resources correctly you should be able to get her
"it's a multi billion $ company bro, they don't need anymore money"
she's been benched since like 1.1
the endgame content is already trivial for veteran accounts
I was contemplating it
"If they just made it so you are able to get global passives for free with a new feature I think it would fix the problem of global passives, but since you need to pull the characters to get it is very predatory and scummy"
"""Lore accurate""? Lol, why my Blade is not immortal and my Aventurine doesn't bring me luck. If we are talking about lore they should rework all older characters then"
"It doesn't revive them at 1 hp, you need to also heal them or provide a shield for them to be revived. So this passive is useless on sustainless teams, and if you are dying with sustain on your team, I don't know what you are doing.
Meanwhile no one talking about how anaxa ult just add all weakness on enemies, Meanwhile break dps like ff can only do 3, boothill to 1 and Silver wolf to 1 as well."
This is honestly an overreaction cause like you guys get so many more pulls per update than us genshin players do so like there is no way you guys cant get her
I need her
why are yall so boring💔 bro i cant WAIT till shes out😭🙏
"Take note that Castorice is an ANNIVERSARY unit on top of being a waifu bait like FF, yet they gave her a borderline useless global passive that is merely lore accurate. Revives with 1 hp, still enemy turn, dies again. 

If they planned to make broken passives in the future like permanent stat boost or dmg boost, they would have given it to Castorice in the first place. Why give an anniversary waifu bait character a useless passive?

The next character I can imagine getting this is Cyrene with a turn reverse mechanic if she is Mem. You can go back a turn once per battle if you make a mistake instead of resetting the whole run.

Anotber one I can think of is Cipher having a global passive that increases the amount of credits you get when farming for it, useless for long term players with millions of credits by now sitting around. 
I doubt she'd get one tho.

I have no idea what Phainon will get, which he obviously. Him and Cyrene will 100% have global passive. 

I'm thinking of global passive in a creative way, not through a negative lense that will just spiral me down to ""global passive that gives crit rate boost"" yada yada.

I view this as a new mechanic that makes a character more unique based on their character or lore.
I don't view it as making the character more generic by giving them just a simple ""free 5% crit rate"" passive and that's it. Cool."
It's opening doors to worse things to come...imagine HSR or  other games adopting this but with actual stat increases next.
"The problem people are missing isnt the revive, but the global passive itself. 

1) Its going to make power creep even worse. Cause old units wont have these passives and the buffed character arent going to be getting them. Plus will the buffed older units be at the level of castorice or future dps/supports? No definitely not cause the company wants to make money on the new character.

2) The glibal passives will get better over time and knowing hyv they will probably be giving stat boosts like crit and speed in the future. making characters a must pull, even if u arent building their archetype (dot, fua, etc). And this potentially leads to creating characters with bad kits but their global passives are a must ir ur account isnt performing at the max dmg potential

3) Its a predatory practice. You ethier have to save reasources and u get like 60-80 pull per patch, or spend 300 dollars to get a 5*, not including the 50/50. Its a clear money grab and people defending this global passive and coping are part of the problem, they dont see how predatory it is and how it leads to to worse things. Sure its not gonna happen right away but look at genshin. In 1.0 and 2.0 it was fine but now its shit. The traverse is locked behind characters like mauvika and ut inly works in natlan. And dendro was so op it broke the game for a long time makjng dendro a must. 

4) Global passives should have been in a system where everyone could get it without the requirement of getting a character. A lot of games do this even gacha games, through some kind of level up system or upgrade system where you spend in game currency at after a certain teir or level up get the passive or a choice to choose a global passive."
Hnmm i dont think that is broken
Lore accurate or not she should NOT be this powerful
"“What are you complaining about? She is the only character with a globe stuff”

Yeah she is the only one because she literally JUST released, everything will start after the first time and the problem here is the people who doesn’t wants her on the first place,

So if i skipped her what that will make to my account? 

Worse than any accounts with her, not the powercreep stuff no no, they can get stronger characters on the future and still she is have that globe thing.

Especially after the older characters buff promises,"
"As usual : it's a waifu boost op méta breaking etc etc it's ok (that the ""ok"" people opinion). If it's a male omg! Powercreep !!!!

Look I will try her (animation is crazy) but that passive.... It's disgusting... And I'm sure it will bé only waifu, just like quantum AND remembrance (and nearly harmony)... But no hoyo isn't sexiste or raciste no.... 🤡"
i just think thank goodness i'm guaranteed
"Wait till they lock these global passives behind E1s,i can deff see them doing smthn like this down the line"
Too much what if and not enough solid evidence to justify the crying
It definitely sets a really bad precedent
"The whole ""Tactic"" to make money is not a great one if people are referring to a FREE TO PLAY GAME! Like hey guys we would like to make money on this game we are constantly updating for free. Like no shoot it is to make money."
"“Hsr takes skill”
Hsr:"
Ngl I like her designs and lore but imo hyv always favor the female too much so I'm just gonna skip the next ver and wait for phainon hopping they give him the same special treatment as her
"if you're f2p and you lose the 50/50 and its a first half banner, youre absolutely cooked lmao. hoyo also releases 2 characters per patch in hsr, unlike genshin"
"@bepo1702  yes we do, we sometimes get even 3 characters. And there is no way you can't save up, cause like you ain't pulling for every character, I prefer to have at least 80 pulls left, unless I really want to max out a character. So if I can save 80 pulls there is no way you can't save up more if you get more pulls per patch"
"it's hoyo verse, if that isn't enough evidence then you're probably quite new to their games, but you'll find out soon enough once the next global passive has all type res pen 2000% 😂😂"
"I don't understand why there is so much hate against this passive, it's not even as broken as it seems, for example, if your sustain dies, it becomes useless, as it only revives if the character is healed or gains shilds and once per battle"
Did people forget bailu exists?
This doesnt even seem as op as people are making it out to be. Reviving with one hp is not a game changer as you can still be killed again if the enemies still have a turn
I love cas
"It is definitely a broken passive, but I don't agree that it's a ""force you to pull"" move. Your phrase ""to make endgame content EASIER"" itself says so. It just makes it much easier. Could you still clear endgame without it? Yes. Do you need her SPECIFICALLY to clear end game? No. Is it absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to clear end game without her? No. This itself makes her not a must pull. They're definitely very strongly trying to make you spend on her, but you could still complete the game without her."
"Oh no, not the the people doomposting the game, we've had this conversation since the beginning of time. The people that want to quit, will quit. The people that wan to play, will play. 
In the end, no one give a damn and just move on, as per usual."
Honestly as someone who is dying a lot in hsr I need this to boost my account I don’t care what anyone says I have been dying this is  a blessing to me
"Even if this one is ""lore accurate"" that is not a good enough reason. If we had ""lore accurate"" anything else in this game everything would be messed up. Lore Accurate Acheron would oneshot anything she gets to hit on principle. Saying ""it's lore accurate"" is very much bullshit. There is a whole lot of characters who would not be playable if it was lore accurate because in lore they can't fight."
If had just stayed when she was in the team only I'd be ok with it we have characters like gepard and bailu that do something similar but it gets too much when not even on the team
she's basically non healer bailu
"well,wait for the difficulty spike.Then the casuals will bark.With this passive in mind,everything will go harder.Even story quest will be harder to beat,not just the endgame content.And when things get hard,the release new character with new global passive to just ease the difficulty.And rinse repeat profit"
"I will say this, who ever bitching about dying in HSR pls play something else this game is not for you."
Waiting for a male character to get a passive so that both parties can feel what it is like to get a global passive on someone they dont want
"I mean yea im all for lore accurate power, then when do we get welt to oneshot everything when he ults? Uknow... When he unleashes a mfking black hole."
"The entire reason why Bailu was needed in early content was because she could revive a dead teammate once, the only difference is that Castorise revives at 1hp and that she doesn't have to be on the team"
"I like it, idc about ppl complaining."
"Omg they said they want future characters to be more ""lore accurate"" but now??"
I think the global part of her passive wouldn't be too much of an issue if was just in SU/DU and/or while you're on the planet of Amphoreus. I feel like making it active in MoC/PF/APoC is the real issue that HoYo added.
"Global passive basically makes it so that you have more than 4 characters. Like, imagine if we get 2 more characters with that plus Bailu? You'd get free revives 4 times in a single battle."
wha!? that is a UNIQUE skill
"bailu cant revive you just by being on your accout though, can she? There is literally 0 comparison to be made here"
"the passive is only broken if you're not using a veteran account. Most people have the right sustains to breeze through moc, apoc and sustainless runs in pure fiction are the way to go anyway. It's useless for me ig"
"this is a terrible mindset. Anyone who turns a blind eye to what this means for the future of the game will be on their knees pleading with tears rolling down their face when daddy hoyo adds res pen, def shred, account wide stat boosts as global passives, then scales the endgame boss hp with the assumption in mind that players have access to all of them. Players who don't want those specific characters get a big fat fuck you and have to end up eating shit. I'll keep playing, but im getting my ass out straight away if they pull some shit like that 😂"
" @bepo1702  This is a great time to move out. They'll pull the ""shit"" regardless."
"@ take the quote marks out when describing the global passives as shit. We all know it's garbage and terrible for the game, especially for low spenders or f2p players who get cucked massively by it. The majority of players aren't whales"
Skill issue
@ this is blessing passion for me i've been dying a lot crazy it not my fault that i keep dying i really this character to boost my account it really handful passion that boost my account very well.
"​​ @リーファー-z5d  it absolutely is your fault if you keep dying, unless you're a newer player without the knowledge and ability to properly build your units to have max potential. Literally just pick any 5 star sustain or an e2+ gallagher and you wipe the floor with this games engame 😂"
@ honestly it isn't my fault it the the enemies that is super hard stress ful dude you don't when you go up against the bosses they have extra stats not many people have the same resource the game has been super hard the enemies exploration of  higher world my team isn't fit that without the global passive skill  I NEED  it as a player  who keeps dying in hsr we need this global passive skill for end game.
"​ @リーファー-z5d its okay if you need her then just pull her, dont listen to those butthead, you're the only one who knows your best team comp, but this global passive only revive with 1hp so u still need a healer to heal them"
"aventurine would increase my luck when summoning, blade would be unkillable. Kafka could mind control the moc boss and order it to unalive itself. Lore accurate character kits would kill this game 😂"
im pretty sure phainon has one. cant wait for all the waifu players to bitch about it 😂
 @bepo1702  Fr. I cant wait to see the reactions
I'm sure you'll like it when the male character you don't want comes with a 100% res pen global passive 😂
"@ i’m a meta slave, if i have to pull to get that, i will, i’m only here to reach big pp dmg, dw"
"one simple thing, if u complain so much abt, then skip it then , no one is forcing u to must pull just bc everyone think it's a ""must pull character"" - _ -;;;; just pull if u like her, or dont pull if u dont like her, thats it - _ -;;;;"
As long as more global passives are added i don't give a crap what they do
"The only issue with this is that they’ll make something better, however the bar is incredibly low right now as this passive isn’t even as good as people are making it seem, as yeah you revive okay but it’s at 1 hp so the chances of you instantly dying again is pretty high, alongside if you are dying a whole bunch where this actually matters in endgame content to begin with then that’s just a skill issue."
"Players are afraid that in the future they will have to be forced to pool characters with buffs that are too powerful, but in reality, with the unique cone and edelon system, hoyo can VERY WELL force a character to have 2 edelon to be useful or something else, or even force more, no need for global, and for me it helps the challenges with a small number of characters"
"I still skip her. also, yes, hsr became a p2w game because of the huge powercreep"
Damn they milking us so much 🤣
The problem is just that it woeks when she's not even on the team. If it was just something that happened while she was on the team like bailu there wouldn't be a problem.
"“Lore accurate, don’t cry” ok don’t come crawling back when the game is unplayable because of powercreep"
"so, what's the difference with FuXuan's?
haven't been playing since the release of Penacony"
Honestly with mydei being immortal it’s already cracked soloing simulated universe with him
"Skipping her for anaxa.
Don't want that global passive non sense shit."
So if I made a character that is overpowered and tell everyone that it's accurate cuz lore it's fine?
"""Castorice's global passive is unfair""
WHAT ABOUT MYDEI? DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR? THAT HE IS IMMORTAL? IS THAT WHAT WE'RE THINKING NOW?"
Just don't die
Cry for those people who have gamble addiction. I already have 24k jades. 100% Castorice and 50/50 for her LC 😙
I. Don't. Care
"That should have kept into the storyline only battle ability not your grinding time battle. Like a special assist ability for the final boss (robot, dan heng, and Robin with astral express). It makes sense because final boss is hard to win and you need it to even the plain field. 😮"
This game is gone. The actual downfall from 1.0 is crazy
At first  I didn't wanted to pull for her because I don't like the character (no hate please that's only my point of view). But since her capacities are broken I don't have the choice to pull for her...
"I just hate that kind of feature, so I will simply skip Castorice"
Wow now think of the things you could do if you put that time into making your real life productive  loser
"Meanwhile you can solo woth Acheron cause she negates battles all together 😂..... But yeah, i need another Scythe welding butterfly girlie

Also, no one can force you to buy anything...yall lack self control and it shows."
yall forgetting that bailu can do that too and it heals more then 1hp so dont cry about it
"No its stupid.

I dont give a shit about lore reasons.

This is gameplay, and its broken"
I love cas but this is something that shouldn't exist
"Tbh idc i see this as a win 
I bet ppl who complain prob jus dun have enuf jade for castorice
Nvr spend any money on hsr and still got character i liked so jus enjoy it"
"No one forcing anyone to spend money to get her though 😂. Calling the game ""pay-to-win"" ignores the fact that success is still achievable without spending money. Some players are still clearing end game content with 4-star characters. But I understand where players are coming from I wasn't planning on pulling for her but this global passive leaning me towards pulling for her 😂"
"I mean to be honest, I didn't realise care about her kit. I kinda tuned out when they were talking about it. I just got excited she's on screen. I've been saving for her when I saw her teaser."
"They’re only healed for 1 hp? Bruh. And people calling that broken? Bailu literally has her own revive too. And weren’t people just complaining about endgame being super hard with all the hp inflation? Now that they release a character that’s strong enough to help players with endgame, people see it as too much. Honestly I love Castorice since I couldn’t even clear MOC 10 this time despite clearing MOC 12 for legit almost every patch."
"It would be good if they make for every character a passiv. For example if u habe bailu u gain 5% effect res for vidhyadria race or something else. Or bronya passiv would be inspire the silvermane guide, increase speed for gepard, bronya etc. Something like that"
Every 5 star should retroactively get a global passive
"The passive itself is the problem, not what it does. The revive is fine, but it opens a door to more stuff and I don't want a future character to just give a crit body to everybody on the account or something like that"
"Err... what's the problem about this global passive?, actually her global passive isn't even the problem we could still clear MOC 12 with 3 star just get a good sustain like lingsha,huohuo or aventurine heck even fu xuan can do I'm still using her since I don't have aventurine bruh, isn't this her global passive is actually good? I mean for those ppl with skill issue like those guys complaining about her passive."
Criaram um boss pra temos que pegar ela
"honestly just so people get even more pissed off I hope they make these global passives more broken in the future, cause at least I'll benefit"
"objectively weak passive that is not a revive since it is lore accurate,it just delay death and you need a shield or heal on the character for him to be ressed"
"Ah the ""it's lore accurate"" people
Next time hoyo will do entire modes and rewards locked behind characters and people will support it, maybe even an entire game you have to roll a character before being able to play"
"I wonder how short sighted you gotta be to be a white knight.
Not just in HoYo’s game but in every gacha community. 
Like do you not see how detrimental passives like these are down the line when the flod gates open ? 

These people ""defending"" the game will be the first to call it ""p2w trash"" when the kettle boils too hard, it happened in other gachas, it’ll happen here too."
"I dislike the fact that teammates can still be revived w/o her on the team, it just doesnt really make sense? Im only really getting her tho bc of her beautiful animations not due to her kit or play style lmao"
So what?? This game is not multiplayer. I can play anything I want.
"revive but in 1 hp, take it or leave it"
she doesn't negate nikador in moc 💀
"Yeah, because Bailu (and also one of Fu Xuan's eidolons, and Gepard, and e6 Arlan) can do it to the whole team and while not even being in the said team (it's sarcasm, btw)

It's not the ""revive"" part of ""Global revive passive"" that people are upset by. It's ""global"", as in ""you get it by getting a character on your account"". Nobody would as much as bat an eye if she revived people on her team"
"you'll keep the same energy when they add a res pen global passive to the male character you don't want, right?"
to create more fomo and fuck over f2p players even more? idk about that one
"bro the people who need the passive have skill issue, not the other way around. People complaining about it dont need it, it's just not a good look for the future if they intend to add mkre"
"No really and we thought this company that's always been greedy and was actually changing, it's all lie it's basically like what they say about the devil no shoot they greedy"
Way too broken and not healthy
I don't see the pay 2 win problem... If you grind you can get her for free... Those are just excuse of weak and lazy player
"Then in next 2 patches enemy will lock everyone in your team and then they will introduce new character with full immunity. Lmao its always like this, after 2-3 version update your character even in e2+ will be useless af."
It will only get worse from here
Those People are just Baliu mains crying for no reason lol 🤣
"The community is definitely cooked, people are defending this clear cash grab. Those that don't understand this is just the beginning of more broken mechanics are short-sighted and possibly ignorant of cause and effect."
How is a free revive a bad thing??
"If she's on the team then its okay, if she's not even in the team, it just doesn't make sense. You'd just be getting her to put in your inventory."
7.0 global passive will erase all enemy turns and give 1000% crit rate and 1000% crit dmg
This is cool and her kit seems just fine
Shills and bootlickers will defend anything. MHY know their players are stupid.
They could've given her free if thats the case 😔 😔
"I literally see no issues with this, her revive isn’t even that big (1hp and you’re probably gonna die right after) and it’s only really good for newer players because if you’re already good at the game and have some built 5 stars you shouldn’t even be dying anyways"
HOYO SINCE HI3Rd ALWAYS DO STUPIDS THING LIKE THIS😂
"I mean, no one is forced to pull for her 🤷‍♂️"
"i think it wouldve made more sense if other parts of her kit are not as strong, making castorice an introduction to global buffs only, but since shes very strong AND the only character with global buffs, she easily makes the game even more unbalanced"
People complain the character who is not released yet...
"Really hate it when people completely miss the point of hating on global passives

Castorice's specific passive is something but just useless by itself. The fact that it simply exists and is being allowed to exist means that not only would hoyo continue making characters with slowly more and more powerful passives but other gachas that copy hoyo would too"
"If only it was passive if she was on the team. It would have been a great way to use the idea of ""passives"" to revamp old characters to have their own and maybe make them better, but instead, it's a global passive."
"Skill issue for those who pulled for every character in penacony to amphoreus.. seriously, this game aint pokemon.. getting characters are optional and you can still get them in their rerun"
Gepard but for all
Welp I have acheron on my main but I will get her in my alt. F2P btw
"I think that people just fear change. If they hate this passive, then they can just completly delete Bailu at that point too"
I don't want this to happen cause It might happen to the games I play
They both right thats cool and all for like a endgame character in a regular game like persona but with a gacha game this is unfair to those who dont want her or just don't have the resources. Feels like a slap in the face ngl
"Westerners being karens on Gaccha games doesn't surprise me, its simply a game and for entertainment, if you dont want her dont get her, you dont have to fucking complain online -_-"
"I think, that turn Based game from Hoyoverse was a mistake xD 😅😂"
People are gonna be pulling for these characters and keeping them at lvl 1.
"Actually this global passive is not broken... It's nothing tbh. 

Like, you are reviving yourself with 1 HP once. We are at the point where we are facing 5 enemies at once. You revive yourself with 1 HP only to perma die in next hit. 

Stop shitting yourself over a passive that is not even broken only because it works without Castorice in team. In fact it will only help new players that have problems with story."
Pulling for castorice for her passive to do zero cycle 🗿
once i heard of this i lost my 654 day streak and just quit
Strategy game is not so strategy in a nutshell
as long as the enemies does not scale up in power due to her passive. coz that still raises the bar for existing characters. Besides there are too much variables in play when fighting now compared to before. It can change the outcome but not all if you still can't beat the enemy before it defeats you.
Uhhh its kinda like barb's c6 no?
I'M WITH THIS
"In my opinion, the easy way to make everyone happy is to make her free to get via an event while making her R6 use the revive ability more than once."
the f? it can be disabled anyway 😂
"Ok for me,, not every time i need to revive a  character"
do you think 1hp can do anything unless they make it go frist after revive
"That's the one think I kinda hope for, if they go all out in terms of bad idea and add global passive that help dish out more damage I at least hope they will have the idea to NOT take said passive into account when making the stats of future monsters, otherwise yeah..."
"This is a valid complaint, this sum re:zero bullshit"
if u dont like dont pull common sense people
Only broke players will cry becay of this.
Doesn't matter to me 😆 I just play to enjoy not to compete.
"Listen, I'm a whale. Not E6 everyone whale, but E0S1-E2S1 most characters whale, with an occassional E4-6 for the fav waifus (typically E3ish for first banner, then E6 on rerun). My opinion on Castorice's GP? It's shit, straight up. If you're dying enough to NEED revives in this game, you either have shit team builds, major skill issues, a F2P that still hasn't used a majority of their pulls and is just running a bare minimum passing team, or an auto-player. HSR is barely a difficult game, and if you do end up dying cause of a skill issue, you can easily just restart the fight. All Castorice's GP does is save a bit of grinding time for the HP sponges for less well off accounts. I don't have the best luck (warp tracker says I'm top 0.2-0.5% on pulls, but I'm bottom 0.5%-2% on rate up luck), and my relic luck is just as bad, but I don't ever have anyone die unless I'm running auto. If I have a skill issue cause I'm being stupid, I just restart. This GP is literally a nothing burger.

Now, do I think global passives are a good thing? Fuck no. I've played tons of gacha games and the thing I hate most is FOMO P2W BS. Depending on what HYV does with GPs, it can go two ways. They keep them as gimmicky/very very tiny buffs that won't change shit(think the room decorations for DU that give 2% X stat or whatever)/useless most of the time abilities like Castorice, OR they go balls to the wall with FOMO P2W ass buffs and kill off the majority of their playerbase that don't want any of that. Given the track record of HYV, I do have a feeling they'll realize the backlash of having too OP of GPs so they won't go balls deep. But majority of people sayong Castorice's GP is absolutely game breaking or whatever the fuck need to chill. 

TL;DR: Revive mechanics in HSR is absolutely useless, even in endgame content unless you're F2P or have major skill issues. I hope GP stays this useless but ya'll overreacting little babies."
Gacha players mad about P2W and powercreep 😂
Hoyo kids will support ofc 🤡🫵
Whose gonna tell them that the gacha game is already pay to win
Unique my ass
"I also have something weird to share:
The Herta is not in my team (But i have her right now) but the basic treasures are still marked in the map. I don’t know if this is set on purpose, or if it is a bug."
"I love Castorice and I am so gonna E0S1 but the idea of global passives is a horrible idea, people who like Castorice are gonna be ""Nah this is fine"" but if a character they don't wanna pull has an insane global passive that like idk increases every member's crit rate by 10% then what are you gonna do? That's a must-pull cuz if you don't you have a massive disadvantage vs people who pulled the character, it's different from having someone like Robin because she's just character that needs to be in a party but getting huge passives for just OWNING a character is ridiculous."
"""that it's a tactic by Hoyo to boost revenue""

EVERYTHING has been a tactic to boost revenue, you dolts. You're realizing this shit just now? 😂"
I think majority of the Community agrees IT SHOULD NOT BE ACTIVE EVEN WHILE SHES OFF THE TEAM its most definitely a Ploy
"As a casual f2p player who only play star rail for the story, this doesn't affect me."
Wait I thought all hoyo games were always pay to win?
Yall can keep the drama i just want a cute purple girl with a pet dragon
"I'm personally just going to cross my fingers and not freak out yet. It's a slippery slope for sure, but the stone hasn't started rolling yet as Castorice's passive itself isn't anything crazy. For the time being, I'm not going to worry about it and just keep having fun."
"I don't really mind but if you combine Bailu and Castorice together in the same team then ya, that's pretty broken but useful if you don't want your main or sub DPS to die"
"Lets clarify why are we so worried about Castorice's global passive.
1- It open hell's gate for even more powercreep. The game ALLWAYS plays around newer chars on its full potencial, so what if it becomes a must have in future to even be able to complete End Game content?
2- Castorice will NOT be the only one with this kind of passive. In the future we could start to see passives way more OP than that, like a 10% healing every turn, 1 extra SP every turn, permanent stat boosts or all characters advance 10% action after each turn. It seems pretty bad and skippable, but those effects WILL STACK, so you will have 1 SP, 10% healing and action advance PASSIVELY EVERY SINGLE TURN WITHOUT EVEN HAVING THE CHARACTERS IN YOUR PARTY.
3-There is no such thing as ""exclusive to X character"". Summons were exclusive to Jim Yuang, Elemental weakness forcing was exclusive to Silver Wolf, different kind of Ult charge was exclusive to Acheron. Think about it."
Can't wait for Phainon and Cyrene to have even more broken global passives as a result. Truly the Honkai Star Rail experience.
"True, it seems like everyone continuously forgets that hoyo hires actual psychologists to force people to top up more"
The thing is that because of powercreep farming pulling currency is going to get more difficult which in turn makes getting your loved characters more difficult while staying f2p
​​ @prmtechnic4347 Isn't that only for newer characters? I ain't pulling for the most recent. I am only farming for the older characters because I like them. Plus I ain't grinding for endgame content. Just the story otherwise I wouldn't have played. Endgame enemies will naturally just be stronger than the story's.
"Why do people get so grumpy over a game character, you can still play the game, it will just be harder"
People support because of Lore?????? Bro she can have the skill but just don't make it global passive.
"I mean. It is revive, but at only 1 hp. Enemies with frequent attacks or aoe attack will deal with it no problem."
"A good way to balance this is to give it a 75% chance to not work if she’s not in the team. This would force people to not rely on her, but still come in handy if worst comes to worst."
I don't know about that just hope you don't get hit after you revive.
"The passive itself is not that OP but can you imagine the future characters who will have much more OP global passives, this will only make this game more p2w, as if the HP inflation wasn't enough..."
why are people complaining it's not like hsr has pvp  like damn just play the game
"Why I don’t care, End game content may be hard for characters to clear and this passive does inspire FMO, but like its more if you want her get her if you don’t then don’t, you don’t need to be a meta slave, I still use Jingliu Blade for content so its just like why the hell would I care for meta? I just want her cause she has a scythe and she’s a cool character not meta reasons"
"They better buff the passive global, because 1 hp is boring"
"Synergistic, character-bound, interactive passives that makes unique and interesting team customisation is GOOD. But global passives that grants stat sticks that are monotonous and territorial for having a character is moronic and unintuitive."
Lore accurate with the authority of Death? What about the players who dont want to pull her? Castorice' lore and design was good enough without them rewarding the waifu gooners
"This really feels like a nothing burger to me. People just want to complain even though they're still gonna pull for these units and some of them are still gonna spend on monthly pass and battle passes while complaining about whale bait.

The revive doesn't seem all too amazing (cause if you could die once, you can die again) and even if they did more world passives, that's just an extra boon you get for pulling that character.

People are acting like this will make the devs consider making a world passive that's a one time boss one shot or something."
"Serious, it's only 1 time activate and also 1 hp per battle. For me, it's not broken at all.
Even the passive activates, as long as the mobs turn, it's still useless as f."
With this and the whole VA situation I'm kinda surprised more people haven't reached the same obvious solution I came to. If you don't support the actions that hoyo is taking then the simplest and most effective solution that you can do as an average player is to quit playing hoyo games. I enjoy hsr and between it and genshin I've spent over $10k but I've quit every hoyo game due to the direction that the company is taking their games.
Oh no big company wants big money? What else is new?
Bailu is literally the same thing...
Oh boo ho. You don’t need to pull her
"Me, fully f2p, been saving for her, and for clearing my end game content, see this as an absolute win"
"I just need DPS to clear as fast possible, the only problem with harder content really haha"
As Long It's First and Last Global Passive Every is Fine.
Basically bailu
"The problem isnt that its broken, its that they are going to add more shit like this in the future"
"If she gets a global passive than Phainon and Cyrene should get theirs too, atk hp aspd buff when they're in your account 😋"
"I decided to quit Honkai Star Rail. Hoyo wanted to boost their sales? SIKE! People are leaving instead. The favortism towards the female characters is too much, they even had the nerve to nerf Anaxa....I'm done. I won't be playing any Hoyo games in the future."
"It's amazing how short-sighted some people are defending this, and how this global passive can potentially ruin the game and the gacha space in general. It's better to hold on to those ""what if's"", than being an ""I told you so"" moment in the future."
With this i expect future boss to 1 shot even with shields
"Lmao, calling it as a cash grab but it is your own responsibility to be spending. Tbh, I think it is unique mechanic in a turn based games like this. It is not that powerful than what people think. She can revive a charcater with 1 hp, which unless its your healers turn, there is still risk, especially facing with Aoe attack enemies. 

But the most concerning for this unique passive is the global stats buff for future characters, I hope it is not that absurb that affects hsr overall gameplay."
The one thing I’m just worried is if the end game is gonna be where you NEED her. I can see them make an enemy where it was kill one party member of their break bar isn’t broken. I can see some scummy plays they will pull.
They’ll start seeing a problem once a character comes out that they do NOT want but have to pull because passive is just that good and makes your account weaker otherwise
Its passive just bailu with extra spice 😂
"Why everybody never think it through before judging? 😭 Hoyo is a multi million dollar company they aint gonna do shits like adding ""Out of the universes Global Passive"" like people expect to and ruin their own artwork."
People complain with everything lol no ones forcing them to get her
they could of just had a cool dying effect when  shes on the team but no they had to do some insane bullshit like revive everyone all the time everywhere
"i dont think her appearance makes this game a pay to win😅 People love to exaggerate things too much. She's not a must to have unit if u dont want her. just pull for whoever u like, its not that deep.

u love waifus? then pull for waifus. u love husbandos? then pull for husbandos."
"It is not that it is broken, this ability is never broken as in my opinion, instead of wanting a revive mechanic, how about not dying in the first place

The real issue isnt the her global passive alone, it is the implication in the future, what if Hoyo makes even more absurd and op global passive, so until they either scrap this idea and remove it, not doing this again or balance it so that it is not stupidly op, this will be an issue for the future, so for now, we just have to wait and see"
It’s not the deep let’s be so fr right now.
Yeah yeah castorice being tied to death while there's two emanators currently playable which is closest to omnipotence
Watch when the fate collab characters will have global passives. If you don't get them it's actual permanent account damage
"I think if Castorice has one, future characters will have some other global passives to make it a bit more integrated. So I’m not gonna be that surprised if people complain when another comes out with a global passive.

ALSO this game is not multiplayer and you ain’t fighting each other, if someone flexes they have Castorice and they got saved by a sick revive then like… I don’t think it should matter as if you just play the game you don’t need that much stuff to get to the main story? Especially if you don’t care and are here for characters and lore then there’s even an easy mode that changes the big fights people might struggle with."
How can people be so stupid?
"Can't wait till Hoyo sells entire modes or entire games locked behind a character because ""it's lore accurate"""
" @jetkirby3981  and watch revenue shills say ""Genshin and HSR are better coz they earn more"""
Do you need new chars for new story quest?
"I just wanna ask a question. Why not wait until this happen? Then there would be reason for anger. Castorice's global passive is useless because the characters might die even after the revive, theres no other additional effects other than the revive. The revive is probably there because it connects to the whole kit of her taking away lots of allies hp. If the devs make another character with a global assive, they have to nerf something big from that character either way. It might just be uniquely only for Castorice, like some other 5 stars having their own unique thing.  Even though global passives are pretty bad, theres no proof that there would be any more of these in the future. Its just a possibility or a what if's that hasnt been proven yet, not even by early access players. Since thats a future we havent seen yet, we can still say to the devs that future global assives will be bad for the game, instead of saying that they don't listen and go on a rage or something. If the future global passives does happen, then the ""devs not listening"" would be justified. Why not cross that bridge when we get to it? Im not trying to make you mad im just wondering why not wait because the ""i told you so"" moment in the future is not really that concrete yet."
" @anonyshark  because waiting and being ""okay"" with these types of features is already a form of consent. By the time the ""i told you so"" moment happens, it's already too late and these devs would've already created multiple global passives in the pipeline. And that's the exact short-sightedness I was referring to. You said it yourself, ""Even though global passives are pretty bad"". Letting them get away with ONE is contradicting your own statement and a clear sign that you're giving them consent to create more."
" @jamesnieves1216  not unless someone does something about it. With the amount of hate to global passives, the ones who favor it or those that are okay with it will be overshadowed by people who dont like these assives since theres alot of us, myself included. Im saying theres no guarantee for the devs to make more global passives if theres alot of people hating on it. Others can just put on surveys or on comments on the app that future global passives shouldnt be added in the future, that would hopefully make the devs listen. We should take action first before doing something too far like drama stuff. Sorry for misinterpreting that im okay with global passives, because im not okay with it as well. Your point with it already being too late is true, i shouldve thought of it before. I just hope there arent game changing global passives in the future"
Telling Hoyo to stop their powercreep has never been a winning argument
​ @anonyshark   If only the Devs read the survey carefully 😔
" @jamesnieves1216  her passive does Not Break anything. If you died once. Youll Just die again.  You still have to be strong enough, you can Just surpass rng to a certain degree, the real Problem IS: IT opens the Gate for Future characters to have also global passives, that will give Everyone 20% crit DMG or Like 10% Résistance,wich yes that would probably Break the game"
@nukecase7447 Can you at least try reading the rest of the thread? You just repeated what I've already mentioned. LOL
"Lacking immaturity perhaps?

THIS is a SINGLE PLAYER game, there is NO competitivity. People who complain are incredibly dumb. The coop part is optional and it does not affect the endgame content in ANY way. So why the hell should people NOT be defending it? 

Are people gonna complain about Elden Ring having good scaling weapon and bad scaling weapons?

The fact people spend money or not is not relevant, you can get Castorice without money, stop being immature."
It’d be find if this game wasn’t gacha. Like a story progression where she’ll join your team after you unlock her and then can choose for her to be on your team. The problem is mixing global passives with a gacha game.
So bailu is now a totaly useless character i mean revive was her only saving grace and it wasnt even enough
A must pull but not necessary enough to splurge too much... It could make things easier but not impossible~
"they could’ve just make it team wide and the complaints would stop, cas is a highly popular and loved character so i assumed many people would pull for her. i don’t know the reason why they need to make it global"
Remember people like this will always say no this is just Chinese propaganda they just want you to spend all your money no they don't force you to spend any money in fact you can play these games without spending a dime but for some reason so many people just want to say oh no you have to spend money because they're forcing you they're not
Just make it so she has to be in the party. Literally that's all it would take.
"Nobody cares about castorice revive. People care about it being global. If it would be in her kit while shes on the team, nobody would care. 
But it being global opens the door for future Charackters and FOMO.
Imagine how hsr is in 2-3 years. When you dident get chars that have a global passiv like 5%Critrate or 10%spd boost :)
The Powercreep is real, if irc right the current base speed of trash monster is 133 and they have 4x the base hp of Monsters from the Lofou
Ohh or imagine smth like a passiv that increases the loot you get from Resin-based Content... Global Passivs hurts the game and anyone who denys it is someone who doesent care or doesent think longterm. 

If anyone here thinks its good pls give me valid arguments for it cuz i cant see any unless you pay each month 400-800$ to get every char."
"""must have"" yeah totally, its not like YOU are the one pulling or anything"
"People aren't mad that the Castorice ability is overpowered, they are mad because this means it won't take long for a character like Cyrene for example just giving your characters 10% true damage while not on the team."
"I understand where people are coming from. But really now, do people still die in this game? With our current selection of preservation units and healers, you won't even die in this game. So I don't think Castorice's passive is that much of a big deal."
The community it's always going to find something to complain about
When was this game or other Hoyo games not p2w?
this will only be helpful to those that don't have a C6 aventurine making their team nearly unkillable
I don't see anyone complaining when previous meta like Acheron released.... 😮 So why now?
You should be able to get global buffs with in game currency 👐
Hoyo simps real smart when they say Castorice lore accurate? She's the symbolism of death and not rebirth deadass
Im already burned out on hsr as is i dont need another reason (i need mydei and anaxa for my husbando collection)
castorice glazers are the weakest link I wouldn’t want this thing anywhere near my account what an insult
Got one shot in divergent oh no oh wait i have revive from castorice still nikador turn proceed to get one shot again 😅😅😅
"Okay im fine with her reviving team mates when shes on the team, makes sense but frickin outside the team?? What the actual frick??"
MANY RPG GAMES HAS THAT ONE CHARACTER WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE
Oh okay so just keep her at lvl 1?
"Before I say anything imma just say we as a community are kinda fucking stupid:

We complain, we beg hoyo for shit, then when they do it, or they do something healthy, we keep bitching abt it:

“Acheron is too strong”, “Jiaoqiu is ass” “firefly is garbage now after the v5 nerf” blah blah blah.

Back around 2.3, I thought it was kinda insane how much Hoyo was freeballing it, and now I realized why:

We’re too fucking unorganized; every time the community has a good opinion, another part shuts it down, or just doesn’t fully have an idea:

“Powercreep is rampant in HSR.”, “the powercreep is bad.”

Like, yeah? But what about other games??

I’ve played arknights, I’ve played CRK and all the other mobile gachas, and tbh, their powercreep is worst :/

“This powercreep will kill the game.”

Yeah? But how the fuck are they supposed to fix that.

“HOYO YOU RACIST ** HOW TOU GOING TO FIX THIS SHOT YOU ****.” (Taken from a real review on the HSR review page on the Apple Store. Btw it was 1 star.. XD)


As it would probably be said; a lot of people complain, but with those complaints, don’t give valid feedback on how to fix it, just more screaming. (Now while I play devil’s advocate, there are good reviews: “I like this game, but I wish that the content was easier.”, “while powercreep is good, I wished it was not this powercreep.”, “this type of game design is toxic; it will kill the game eventually.”)

Now, onto the main issue:


Castorice’s global passive….


Overall, it’s kinda ass:

The passive is a lot like Bailu’s revive, but on every team.

As for why it’s the case?

Moc’s 3 star conditions requires that a character doesn’t get downed, so if you have that happens, your already screwed.

In addition, since it only puts you on 1 HP, it causes DOT to install kill, and if healer is dead, you’re still screwed. (Or sustainless.)



It’s good for stuff like sustainless, but even then, means nothing: it’s a QOL more than anything, just like Acheron in the first anniversary.


Now, Why is is so controversial?

Well 1. it’s a global passive, which for anyone who’s played games like this, causes a skewing affect on the game. (TLDR; when you have something like this, it boosts everything you have, but in doing so, has to make the endgame content harder.)

2. It could easily go to other characters:

Hoyo has had a good track record with HSR with limiting overall duplicate kits. (Besides like Clara and Yunli… also Mydei and blade)

But if we have even more units like Castorice with global buffs, it could ruin the game’s difficulty, and in turn, F2P status.

If we keep globals limited to limited characters, and the game chooses to scale endgame on those characters, then we’re just fucked.. 

Lastly, it’s also the fact of f2P;

Up till now, nothing was required to be pulled, just stuff that people wanted, and what could be scrounged up to be used to 3 star MOC. (It’s still possibly with 1.0 units; if you don’t believe me, search up the 4 star 3 star MOCs for the last couple of MOCs.)

Global passives skewing the meta, causes people who don’t have them to pull because newer meta is impossible without them. (Going into point 1.)

Different from that, is that it now FORCES, the players to have to pull to play, something that puts a bad taste in people’s mouths:

If the game gets to a point where you can’t clear something without pulling a character, something that is either gate locked by currency, which you have a limited amount, and or is hard to obtain a lot to get, or the character immediately after being obtained becomes dead.

Once it gets to that point, that is no longer playing a gacha game.

That’s playing to give people your money.

In summary: castorice isn’t the problem, it’s the Pandora’s box her kit opened:

In allowing global passives, it opens a toxic door which could kill the game, a lot like other gacha games. (Best case is CRK: I loved that game before I realized how fucked up the game’s powercreep was.

1 months of grinding on old characters could be blitzed by a lvl 1 super epic, ancient cookie which requires 100-200$ to guarantee, which became worst when you literally had a PVP :V, and they basically came out, EVERY MONTH. )

If the game chooses to embrace global passive, it’s like walking on eggshells which could easily kill, or flatline the game, causing it to be too hard for newer players to join, while bleeding it’s playercount.

What makes this worst is that the fanbase will keep complaining about it without doing shit.

So imma say it as a person who want this game to last longer than the weird cookie game:

COMMUNICATE WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG PEOPLE.

Like, I get most of the people here are kids, but it’s not good that most reviews are just scream matches with imaginary hoyo devs, which act like it’s good when it basically says nothing :/

If the game dies, it a mix of hoyo devs dying like the SpongeBob meme, and a mix of us being dumbasses which enabled, and allowed it.

I’m kept criticizing the game, since somebody has to, but either way, let’s see what the next year will hold, but if the community don’t hound the devs on this shit, we’re fucked :/"
"I’m a fan of lore accuracy in games where it makes sense, but gacha games are not in that list that I accept"
"First - Complaining abouts Pay to Win in Gacha game is stupid
Second - her revive only give 1 HP which still 1 hit away from death maybe could even die instantly afyer revive due to some enemies have DoT damage which mean you actually can't replace the GOD KNOW SO IMPORTANT sustain unit with more support or dps OR even if you already have a sustain in the team and still die then that's mean you just not ready for end game contents if your sustainer can't do their job
Third - as much you like the characters you can't use ""lore accurate"" as an excuse for your character to be special in an argument because the heck you mean ""Castorice lore accurate that is why she can revive"" while my general of godly thunder need be to on a whole life support of cancer stage 5 to be actually playable

TLDR : Castorice global passive isn't that good 
Gacha games run on money 
Lore accurate is not an excuse for Hoyo to sneak in more of global buff
And most people that got into any Gacha game after 2020 (Genshin/Covid) have a stupid opinion because they are normies"
I think if it goes through it should only work in Amphoreous because shes the demi titan of death in Amphoreous other worlds don't believe/ know the titans or castorice so i think it should only work in amphoreous
I don't understand it's beneficial so why people complaining?? Like you don't need to get her if you don't want her :sob:
No one forcing you to wish for her stop crying
Castorice: I ACTIVATE MONSTER REBORN
I still think its a good thing to add bcs no. 1 its related to lore no.2 u can still beat harder gamemodes with proper teams. I dont see a problem if dont wanna get her dont get her if you want to get her get her.
idk i never died in game so...
What’s the Background song?
"Breaking news, bailu found dead in the streets"
WILD HUNT!!!!!!
"I quit HSR about 10 months ago due to powercreep and HP sponge endgame. I come across YT shorts of HSR time to time. Each time it reminds me that I made the right choice. Wtf is this lol, I'll never play a turn based gacha ever again."
i get it but ppl making it seem op when its 1 hp and it could literally be the enemy’s turn and kills him again ig it just matters how u use it ig
"People that cry about the revive just suck at the game. Most good teams never die and castorice passive would never activate. Its a nice back up if things do end up going south but she isn't a ""you need her or your account is dead'"
"To be honest, I'm just pulling because I love her ^^
Doesn't matter if she's broken or no because I love her character/personality, story and design"
Isnt that jst what c0 bailu does??
"Tbf i dont mind the passive, cuz even without Castorice, i can still win HSR. Im not that heavy on MoC either ."
Why do people make it sound like this is a first. Hasnt Genshin been doing the same thing for years. You literally have characters that halve the resource you need for certain things as long as they are in the account and that was fine 😂 now they make an incombat passive that noone will ever get to see and its a problem. I dont particularly care about these stuff but the double standard is wild.
Yall are overreacting over this its just a single revive 😭
I think it's not THAT OP since she only gives you 1 hp upon reviving? (I might be wrong though)
"I just remembered the ""Dont Die at Me"" from Facebook game"
We have bailu guys
"As a f2p who really is desperate for rolls 24/7 I can say Waa Waa to the losers who complain. Yes I need to get that character too, but I instead put some effort into grinding the game instead"
"Yeah I don’t care whatever petty tactic they’re using, I will skip her. Since the start of the game I only pull the characters I like, and nothing will change."
"Oh, I'm fine if shes in the party, but out of the party??? I dont like that. And the fact that you cant turn it off since its just always there..."
"I can see 2 different opinions on this:

1.My personal opinion:
This game have been p2w for a long time. U need to pull specific char to clear the current end game contents easier. And then the char will get powercreep 3-4 patches later which is very quick n makes it hard for f2p to play this game.

2.Average hoyoshill reaction:
This is not a ""competitive game"", u can still enjoy the game even without having Castorice so its ""fine"".

Ps: People said that Acheron is broken n it is too early for a char with that kit to be release during 1st anniv. 3-4 patches later she drop to T0.5. Bet same thing will happen to Castorice anyways. 

The quick powercreep is why i quit. I m now playing a gacha game that gives a ""healthier"" relationship. So u can do whatever u want hoyo, i don't care anymore."
"Lore is such a stupid explanation, there's Blade who unlike Mydei is ACTUALLY immortal but noo."
"I do not intent to pull for her, and this mechanic is really annoying for people who don’t want her. She’s insanely broken, and just having her buffs any team.  I have no doubt every single damage showcase is gonna have her reviving someone now."
Just don't die 💀 skill issue imagine dying in a turn based game which are for babies 🤡🤡🤡
"Castorice global passive vs hoolay 😊
We should boicott hoolay instead because castorice global passive is useless againts hoolay."
"Honkai, el único juego donde los jugadores se quejan de un personaje roto en un juego PVE."
just add more global passives and people will stop complaining
"Why people are so worried about this? Just a question, because I think it’s not kind of big problem, if HSR was pvp then yeah I would understand. But the game is only for one person and you play the way you want. My biggest concern is not about powercreep (cause it will always exist) but about supporting old characters. That’s all, just want to know what are people talking about("
"Currently saved up 220 pulls, and I still won’t pull for Castorice. I don’t even have the BiS team for her."
Reviving on 1 hp isn’t event a powerceeep.
"There are characters that revive
Blessings in su have revive"
"Castorice's passive in theory is not really that broken especially if you know what you're doing. BUT it does set the presedent that they'll come up with even more broken global passives, hurting the game in the long-term. THAT'S what people are pissed off over, and no amount of lore or bullshit will justify a blatant predatory practice like this"
Just pull for her bro 😅
Haven't touched a Hoyo game in months and its almost ironic that every time I see something about them its another reason I'll never go back. Though I do actually like ZZZ and I havent heard much from that game so I guess thats good?
i don't see this as bad cus this only does 2 things. either does nothing at conundrum 5+ where i take fatal damage and then still die later or i just win anyway without dying. thing is Honkai Star Rail is easy enough where to you shouldn't have problems clearing content till either A you get to high conundrums in sim uni or B you don't do enough damage to kill the bugs before they multiply again and as i said earlier its not a problem in sim uni cus i still die and the whole bug problem isn't a problem anyway since its not me dying thats the problem. having said this i do think its weird that its active even when she isn't on the team but again i don't think its that big of a deal for the reasons i have stated
"The global passive itself isn't THAT broken. The real problem lies in the fact that this sets a very dangerous precedent, where  even if you're not interested in a character you might still feel pressure to get them because simply by owning them all your roster gets a little stronger.

Sure, a global revive passive once per battle won't save you when you are completely outmatched, but what if you also add 10% increased healing to your team from a different character's global passive? Or 20% debuff resistance? Or, god forbid, increased atk% or increased SPD?

What if, on the other hand, you JUST ABOUT missed on clearing endgame fights at the highest rating, and having that global passive would have pushed you over the finish line?"
"One thing that bother me about Castorice is that she is like a very picky macron because I heard her build is very picky and her lightcone none of the f2p lightcone works nothing for her like ""Oh crt lightcone it's fine but she doesn't really need it"" or ""Oh she needs this but not the other things include"""
"If someone's units are dying, a healer is a must-pull for them not Castorice. xD"
"The universal passive itself isn’t AS bad as everyone makes it out to be, since it can only be activated once per battle and puts your characters at 1 HP, so they’ll probably get killed again anyways. That’s not the main issue, the issue is that this opens doors for global passives that will eventually power creep this one. I was never for it in the first place and will not be pulling for her, I just hope Hoyo will not make more characters like this in the future."
Where the hell are the hoyoshills who said the global buff was only for beta only? Pretty sure they are getting their wallets ready to pull for every character with the passives now.
Does anyone know about C6 Barbara... No?
"itd be okay if it still counts as a character dying even if the passive triggers, so the ""no characters downed"" MOC star is the same for people who have and dont have cas"
"Just make it so her passive only works when shes in the team. People will quit the game over every little thing, wont they? Devs need constructive criticism, not just things like, ""pOwEr CrEeP"""
"Oh no, they added a broken mechanic in my singleplayer game"
"I don't know, I just want Castorice, I thought her ult is funny and unnecessarily big, which made me chuckle"
I think videos like this are dumb
"I saw one opinion from other CC saying that this passive is bad, in the meaning that if a character dies, your sustain is useless"
"tbh the main issue is that it's a global passive
the effect itself is pretty trash like any other revive since it only works once per battle
but it sets a precedent and if the slowly make more global passives and make them stronger than the last they would eventually have to balance the game around it forcing you to pull new characters"
"As Someone pulling for Castorice since Day 1
""Ohh nooo... Anyway"""
Wait until you guys fight that Hoolay guy when it's his turn
"Me, who resets withvery death even whe I use Bailu:

-I don't see the problem..."
"It seems to me like an interesting feature. Different characters have different passives and skills. It would be boring if all characters were the same! It makes things more interesting. I don't know if I'll pull for Castorice, but why complain about a cool feature? I see these kind of complaints every time a new character is released. Saw them with The Herta, Tribbie, e.t.c."
"i think global passives are a cool feature but i think they should be very restrictive, for instance castorice's passive should only activate for one character once in the battle if she's not on field but if she is on field then every character can revive once per battle instead"
Pretty sure they all spammed the chat when it was revealed in the livestream.
Its not really pay to win it just makes the game easier
I woulnt mind if the passive was not global but a on field passive. If we go by LORE as an excuse then lets give THE Herta a global passive that you insta unlock everything on the simulated universe. Or if you have aventurine you can never lose a  slot machine if you have jade BOOM! Now your account has infinite credits. See how stupid that is....
"I think a global passive is neat, but yeah, definitelt too strong without some restrictions lol.
For example, it shpuldnt be allowed in mirrors or apocalyptic shadow or pure fiction unless she is on team.
Other than that? I am indeed afraid of the implications this could have on not only hsr, but in other hoyo games in general since, well, a gacha game is still a gacha"
"Cmon.... We all knew that Castorice would be the anniversary character... 
Plus, she is quite literally death at this point. 
So
Let her say ""Arise"""
"The revive thing isn't a one off barbara can do it but she has to be in the party, this is too broken, working even when she is not in the party is absurd"
C6 barb
"The only Problem is see with that is that no sustain Teams are getting much more benefited by that than Teams with Sustains. We already are in an Meta where Sustain less Teams are working great and are stronger than Teams with sustains in some encounters. 
Having a Character that Heals one Character in our Sustain less Team while she isn't even there that would mean everyone could just play sustain less Teams. 
If everyone just plays sustain less Teams, Hoyo will see that thinks like Moc get easyer again cause everyone has suddenly more dmg in they Team and so one they will inflate the HP massiv again so Teams with sustain will not make the needed Dmg."
"She just revived then those resetting your team ro redoing the fight is also  power creep? Like come one they added something that can help you and yall still mad? Like everything that hoyo do yall thought it some kindo marketing strategies like i dont even play Honkai, but the players yall just so ungrateful look at that character she is cute and powerful even if she dont have that passive to revived character yall still pull right?, so yall want character that stay as strong as the other one while the enemy getting stronger, yeah Goodluck with that"
Hoyocreep
Who is others ?
I mean Bailu can do a revive too so. Also yeah Castorice is the Heir who will become the new God of Death after Thanatos and her whole thing is dominion over the dead. It's as lore accurate as you can be with one who holds power over death.
Of course is the most op pasive in all the gachas games... revive 1 character even if she is not in the team... its literally pay to win.
Blade be like: stop healing me ヽ(💢`Д´)ﾉ
lmao reviving does not mean you will win. ask bailu enjoyers. they plan for failure and rightfully so
"Just don't die guys, duh"
It's actually a good thing. that weirdo left the game because of this
"Dont even play HSR, im just consuming knowledge for no reason."
Like can they atleast give us a way to turn it on ot off
"As a guy who only cares about pulling hot men and 4☆ characters, she seems cool! I'm still skipping her for the hot men 👍"
I think it should be only when castorice is on the team
"if you need a revive in general you are just bad. so its not a broken mechanic, you just need to ""Git Gud"""
"I mean honestly I'm ok with this
Because all of the new characters have a unique animation on their character so I get it 
I just don't get why it still goes on when castorice isn't there?
Like it would have been better to not effect like a healer
But I'm not against it either 
And I'm gonna skip her cause I want anaxa 
My bitch speech teacher😂
(And honestly hoyo need to make money so what was that line? Like are people serious at this point?
If you wanna make it easier it will be fine in other situations too 
Like I get it it is hard but like myself I got at least near a year(I think maybe more) to beat that bug shit roan mei made- 
So yeah pls get what I'm getting at yeah)"
"People forget this game doesn't even have leaderboards or something to make it competitive, where's the pay to win?"
If your characters dying you making something wrong 😅
I love this 🙌 you don't have to pull for her tbh
"This is a good mechanic that fits into her lore, so I think it's fine"
"Please do correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't bailu have a similar ability?"
The game has always been pay 2 win
"I’m pulling her not because of her passive, but because she has pretty animations"
"I repeat,to fix this they should just make the global passive obtainable even with clearing some part of the story and make the character only unlocking it without the need of that.
But anyway i have the sensation we will not see much other global passives after this unlike what most people say, honestly its just a sensation,but until now all my sensation were right so i have high hopes"
"The gameplay has rules. There's way too many characters who break them already. And ""muh lore"" shouldn't be the excuse here. With Silverwolf, I personally think that was as far as it should've gone for weakness implants. And I think characters relying on Break like FF deserve a certain amount of Res ignore. But the amount of rule ignoring in the game is too much imo"
"You don't have to pull everyone, I didnt pull for mydei to pull for her as a f2p"
The problem isn’t the passive it’s the precedence of said global abd one of said global one of the fate collab characters WILL have so it’s a scummy way to force players to pull for characters they’d initially wanted to skip.
Nah it's not a problem
Welcome to the downfall of HSR...
This is why i stoped playing it sll bs now
"I think people need to jumpstart an extra brain cell, stop spending gems randomly, and get characters they need the most."
Acheron should be stronger than her if it was lore accurate. But unfortunately this is not the case…
"""just lore accurate"" is a stupid statement to defend a literal must have p2w character, Mydei is most definitely lorewise stronger than her since he is god of war as of now but he isn't even close to being a must have for endgame"
"In my opinion, I think she's so cool and i've been saving since i've got The Herta"
"I’m saying this here because I know for a fact, at least some people will see this note. This is my opinion if you disagree I don’t care.
If you don’t want the passive to affect your gameplay, don’t pull the character, plain and simple  I’m not pulling for her not because I don’t want her. I would generally love to have a chance to get a redo button without having to start the whole fight over. I’m not pulling for her because I don’t play like that. I’ll get there at some point it’s just my account is not that strong yet. ALL 30 pulls are for Fuge /her light cone as well and it’s not even open for debate. Is the purple reapers, passive strong yes, is it game breaking absolutely fucking not.
( if I call my host I’m sorry I tried to do this on a sub read and a lot of people called me a slur that is depicted towards people with autism so yea they can kiss my ass they’re blowing something up that is not even a issue )"
"Global passives can be good but this one needs a nerf since it can be activated even if she's OUTSIDE the party. Gave Bailu the middle finger hard. I think it would've been fine if the player could choose 1 character to make them revive and only them for the combat, then sure. But even if its only 1 time per battle its basically screaming, ""If you miss out on her the end game will be much harder on you so I hope you whaled hard on your dps."""
"Those think the God key system in HI3, which used to be not bad, till part 2 with 3 god key stacks, is a good way to rip people off their wallets, and apply its to the rest of Hoyo games. Good work, geniuses."
"Me: it's another waifu, you meta-creeps"
People are pissed that the whole cast of the flamechasers v2 are no way knferior to arons even rivalkng emanators
Doesn’t Bailu do the same thing?
"We shall have her and more similar support characters in the future, why not?!"
Are we forgetting bailu exists? she has a revive mechanic too
"People don't even realize what will happen in the future, blind  hoyoshills.

I am actually not sad for them, I am just dissapointed."
"Nah....
She Is good the she Is now...."
I am just here to take my wife rest is extra 😊
"I already have both Aventurine and Huo Huo, and bc of the anniversary, I'll get Luocha AND ON TOP OF THAT, I can put Fu Xuan in the permanent banner instead of Gepard who I already have, so in terms of survivability, I'm done, I actually don't need Castorice revival
I'm only pulling her just because I like her overall kit which is fucking insane, and bc I like her design"
I like it and it shove been added sooner
"so, its just a focus sash in a gacha game?"
"Sorry for what im about to say, but if you let a character die in any gamemode, you or your team suck ass 😂"
"""by lore"" okay? silver wolf literally hacks the universe, and all she does is apply a couple debuffs and add a random weakness element of wha tyou have in the party, when in lore she could just delete the enemies

acheron can oneshot anything by lore, but in gameplay, you need to apply 9 debuffs before she can even ult, which doesn't always oneshot (especially with the hp inflation)

blade and mydei are literally immortal, and they have limits in battle

welt has an entire black hole, and the enemies are still alive.

yet for cas, she basically gets a death confirmation email whenever a team member dies, she doesn't even need to be there.

TL;DR alot of other characters have part of their lore in gameplay, but it's balanced, and for bailu who can revive, it's one character (2 if e6), once a battle, and she's also a healer so it makes sense, then she also left the meta a long time ago"
"Yep, if she in the team, then it fine. But it still affect the team that without her presence, that is p2w"
...i have a guarantee and high pity already so no problem for me :))
Make sense to its lore: also Anaxa doing literally only 160dmg ratio for a 140 energy ult.
Pay 2 win? Si no lo sacan es su problema
"I aint ever seen a playerbase get so worked up over the ""meta"" of a SINGLE-PLAYER GAME. Enjoy the game how you like, its not like you're griefing other people for bad balancing in ranked smh"
I havent played since early 2.x patches safe to say im pulling for her but the powercreep is the whole reason i stopped playing 😭
"1. Getting revived once a match isnt not that big.
2. If Cas is a very very special character in a special case, its gonna be ok.

It would only be a problem if she's not, and they keep doing it like a casual thing."
Easy save for her
Dont care i am pulling her
seen the leaks future characters also have global passive one have boosting max hp of all characters
"Admit it, your team just so weak that you have to roll Castorice just for those passive. What do you mean Must pull character?"
I'm a new player in HSR..... I'm not going ever to spend on this game..... I just abuse the meta in early game and then do whatever i like for the sake of the fun when i get bored of meta
If she is in the team i can agree to it...but just because u have her u get the passive even thou u dont use her in team is bad😞
Yup.. it’s just lore..
it feels like you're triggering a C6 Qiqi but actually without Qiqi being in your current active team. But your revival is just there
"The Powercreep in Star Fail is insane even compared to Honkai Impact, wth"
Wait until they release character with Ruan Mei kits for their global passive
If you dont like this than dont play her
If you need to pull her for the revive it’s a skill issue 😂
"To make it simple, You're pulling and building 5 meta characters now instead of 4 and the chance of making it 6 is high."
Innovation? This is Gepard powercrept
"anybody seeing this as a weak passive, sure, but this is just THE 1ST OF MANY..."
sips i dont need money to get her hahah
Its more so the possibility future characters are going to have these kind of mechanics an force players to get them for the passive rather than actually liking them. Cause being real we already have Bailu an we have modes where we attempt no sustain challenges so the characters are gonna get offed any way around.
"Even I, who doesn't care about endgame, sees this as a problem and a bad precedence. I don't take endgame seriously, but I've heard that the HP-inflation is crazy... the existence of global passives like this will allow bosses to become even more difficult to the point where you can only use the characters with those passives to clear it, in a way forcing you to pull for them even when you don't like them.


I'm so glad I just play for the story 😭"
Well saying hoyo forces them to pull. They literally “force” you every time ‘cus the endgames change and give buffs to the new characters . And i think castorice is not P2W bc hsr give so many stellar jades  so everyone can farm enough pulls to get her and this passive in not locked behind cons so..
ain't no way they just powercrept my bailu with a non healer
"ignoring the global passive it was a 10/10 livestream

announced which old unit gets buffs, free limited *5 unit, 50/50 rework, storytelling issues mentioned, etc"
Sounds like some people got a skill issue known as being broke. Get your bread up fam. Jk. I’m just tryna aura farm like Piccolo and Jin Woo.
"How is getting a free revive (which, by triggering it, means you have skill issue) a P2W feature? 

Ive already had my laugh at those E2 Fu Xuan havers for even wanting an E2 Fu Xuan.

Again, having a global passive feature IS alarming, but Castorice's passive itself isn't... Its a thing that lures those noobs in or for skill issue ones...

If you're an experienced player, youre literally getting a useless global passive."
"So it works once, u get back with low hp, is that it?"
"I think the ""it's because of the lore"" is the biggest meatrider sentence ever"
"I’m kinda down the middle. It’s not as good as bailu’s in raw numbers, but the fact it can activate without her being on the team is a little concerning."
Even when not in the team is just absurd...
"Can y’all shut up I’m trying to enjoying the game, like yall acting like you have to get her you don’t."
"Still pulling, I won't cry bout one or two broken buffs, let them do it, at least it's better than genshin can offer at the end of the day it's just a game for god sake, complaining over something based on just a game is nuts"
bg ad ig/tt kah?
"I understand the complaints for this mechanic and for the game's future, but at least they're giving her away so for now i think it's fine"
"Ya'll miss the point, even if Castorice global passive is not that boosted, Hoyo might add more boosted global passives in future."
"""We want strong unique characters!""

""No! Not like that!!"""
Wait till hoyo balance endgame content around global passive in mind
It’s unique. Plus you can’t spam the passive. Some people and CC just want to complain about anything even when it’s unnecessary.
The main reason im with hoyo on this one is that the hrs community is the fact that they wil flip flop any time hoyo release anything character too storng complain too weak complain character is balanced complain like i can see why the devs dont listen and also the fact that people are getting angry from somethingn that is first optional and second inevitable cuz hsr is a turn base game alot of people can onlt play that like 20-30min till they get bored so of course they are gona do do smt to engage the audience.
"Well in my opinion it's not that good, like other character like bailu also haves a reanimation, but that not makes bailu a meta character, Castorice is the same, her reanimation it's not that good(?. And it's not that common to lose a character if you have good builded Supports, even in difficult End game"
 @aelia4788  So what's the point of complaining if you can still clear story content...
"Nah, imo the livestream was still ass. Pretty much the same but i guess a new system for whales and a ""free"" new 5 star. It doesnt feel like an anniversary patch"
 @piie6603  they are buffing old units and giving free units that anniversary worth patch
 @piie6603  your probably  a whale so it make sense
" @piie6603  did u even watch the stream bro, hsr always had 3~2 events per patch, it has been consistent so far. But we can keep giving feedback and hope they listen to us (they have proved us that they pay attention to feedback)"
"Bottom of the barrel rewards. Luocha is irrelevant, ruan mei is a niche with better alternatives, 30 pulls is nothing compared to how many banners they are re-running, buffs don't count because they mentioned buffing old characters in last update, they just gave the names of the characters that will be buffed after 3 months. Bet even in 3.4 they will say that have only buffed the skill damage and the next rework is coming in 3.7. Mentioning ≠ Good thing."
"​ @Riyozsu ""How many""...? Like... You pull everyone buddy? Then yeah... I guess 30 is not worth at all to you."
"I wish we knew how the older units are gonna be buffed, because if all their do is upping the scaling the newer units will still deal 10 times more DMG making the buffs inherently useless"
​ @Riyozsu  ypu literally get 30 pulls just for logging in. And of course they're gonns do big banner events it's the fucking anniversary
​ @oneplay5570  Oh yeah a healer that people use less than gallegher and ruan mei who most people already have lol
@ are you talking about luocha yeah no. On release day at lot of people think he wasnt good until later people found him to be op. And if you deadass thinking gallegher is better luocha then you need to uninstall your game lmfao.
" @oneplay5570   name one team where you would pick luocha for sustain over aventurine or fu xuan or huo huo or lingsha and gallagher? luocha does nothing other than sustain, meanwhile the rest of the sustain provides other utils which is why they are so good, huo huo gives atk + 20 er , fu xuan gives CR aventurine gives CDM and debuffs and he is highly SP positive and soon hyacine can burn HP perfect for mydei and castorice lingsha is basically a break DPS with added break dmg taken and gallegher can also apply debuff with higher break dmg taken by enemies"
​ @Indian_gae_boii e1 rm is nice to have not everyone has e6 rm u kniw
Not really a good livestream 30 pulls was expected they cant give less than last year they had to give stomething more they did give us free 5 dtar which tbh the only good part of the livestream they announce they buffing old characters long time ago now they talked about it around 2 sec and they was done for it we dont even know what the buffs are and lastly the most scammy thing they add the lcs from the characters that are in 50/50 to the shop meaning the only way you can get them by buying bp how am i as a f2p can get fu xuan lc without spending money
"They can't make unique characters. They can't make unique bosses.
Their only solution is double the boss hp and make the previous released character's ultimate the next character's skill and the character in leak's passive."
Just fcking play man.
"Op for sure, lore accurate too. Would be balanced if she's in the team only. I Don't care tho,  ill roll for her anyways"
I think it’s fine.
So google clasroom?
See i like the passive the only problem is it effects THE ACCOUNT INSTEAD OF JUST EFFECTING THE TEAM SHES ON
"With the current difficulty level (which we can all agree is the root of all our problems), if a character dies, it's a sign of a lost battle. Either because your team isn't quick enough to finish the fight or a sustainer can't keep up with enemies' atacks . Reviving one character with 1 hp will not give you a lot of advantage"
My characters legit never die so the whole revive thing is absolutely pointless to me but i guess for beginners it might be a little helpful. If you are in the edngame and you keep dying in battle thats a massive skill issue
I just hope that this doesn't influence other gacha games and since I've become a full time wuwa player i really don't want it on there even if the character is free
next global passive: your team will use your credit card balance to attacks
So she's Pay To Win in a Pay To Win Game?!
She is not going to be unique there are more global passive cheracter going to be
In endgame content you shouldn’t die anyways…
"Not really, in genshin there is 4 star character Barbara do the exactly same things at cons 6(eidolons in hsr). When I got her c6 barely anythings change, if ur build suck then u eventually lose anyways"
"The main problem is that this is the ultimate characters. As long as you have him you have a HUGE adventage in everything you do. You do t have to build it you dont have to use it you dont even have to lvl up her. With this kind of design wath just stop them to send some terrible design héros with good globale passive. If the game is just collectioning passive character it's not about having a good team with a build that make sens it's about spending 3000 bucks to have the most bustes team by just collectioning a bunch of randomn character who have passive.
Hsr gameplay is based on building team that sinergize well with each other making stuff that affect your gameplay without having to include a character in your party is just not in the identity of this kind of game. Furthermore it make the game a hell to jump into after if to even grasp the end game content you need a team of good builded character+ 20 passive effect character. It's not attractive for New player it's predatory for f2p and low spender and it's not attractive for New player.
I concider this game design a complet and utter failur of mihoyo."
"Ok so... We have a 2 button game, come with auto fighting dude name Mydei and now a auto life saving Castorice... What's next? A character that auto do map explore and collect everything plus E6 auto do quest?"
"I want to think this is just a ""Lore accurate"" passive and not something that every character will do"
Uninstalled 😊
"if y'all don't like it, don't pull for her
if y'all like it, pull for her 

what's the matter?"
"you guys doesnt have any shield and healer character?and mad at this?

you guys are dumb or what?"
Y’all don’t forget abt how she’s the anniversary character so she’s straight up just guaranteed to be op (like Acheron/Aventurine last year)
Try not to overreact over anything level impossible
" @wings2990  ""try not to be surprised when the game keep fuck up everything slowly"""
What do you have to say for the next 3 characters in beta that have global passives too? Have you seen Phainon's kit?
"@ first of all, yes I have and second of all atp just cope"
​ @RD_Kaisel  yall are weak
 @betuloz3947  and y’all are pathetic if you’re raging over a single-player Gacha game
 @RD_Kaisel  the people who complains wants the best for the game. People who defends it are either sheep or just shoe lickers of hoyo. You're pathetic for letting developers take advantage of you wont be surprise if u defend genshin as well.
@ you sure people who complain really want the best for the game? People who truly want the best would take the time to contact Hoyo and not review bomb them on every platform. Wouldn’t surprise me if you were in that second category.
@ and what if I am cheap? All I want to do is play the game and nothing else
"​ @RD_Kaisel funny enough, hoyo only responds when you review bomb and stir up enough drama. Their feedback functions they chose to ignore to this day in things they dont like to change. This is since the very early days of genshin"
 @littleswansplaygrownd6817  the whole anniversary drama lmao
 @RD_Kaisel  do you actually think mihoyo would actually gaf if players protested peacefully
@ well do they gaf rn as the players are protesting not peacefully? No. Exactly.
 @RD_Kaisel  they will lmao? Do you forget the whole genshin anniversary thing? They actually listened the players once. You are so full of yourself 😭
"just wait for elysia version in this game:))

but for Castorice they are just crying for me

It's lore accurate passive and she is not must have character for me
It"
"""Unique inovation"" Limbus Company did It first."
I think people forgot every single character makes endgame content easier
You don't have to pull it's optional
"The passive itself is actually not that good, it's moreso the precedent it sets as well as the potential for future passives to be broken, that I'd the real problem 

Also, fuck they mean ""lore accurate""? Acheron and THerta are emenators but they don't have something like that, Acheron is the emenator of IX which is pretty much the embodiment of death in the universe yet she doesn't have any similar abilities

By that same logic, both Mydei and blade should literally be impossible to kill since they are immortal"
"Because I skipped Midei and Tribbie, I have enough to lose a 50/50 and get Castorice...
I mean, I don't have to spend any coin in this game. I don't see the pay2win here"
People are just babys
"As a half f2p I don't see much powercreep for this ability I don't die much or die at all this ability is useless but if in the future where it going be buff like crit damage or rate it definitely will be a problem as it will be meta

But same time it player who kept pulling for every new character have this issue I personally don't have it and still rich with jades"
Alao me with no healers on the team
"People complaining it's p2w, me who was saving for the past two patches 👀 👁👁"
"No offense to anyone, not even Twitter (who are clowns themselves) but the Unique thing i hear is Yap Yap yap and a Lot of crying... ¿Why take that personally a passive? The Point of a character is what can add to your team to make it stronger this shit is literally normal on every gacha and is not like this was the first time Acheron and a Lot of characters got Already good passives who make your team strong enough or other stuffs... Just stop crying or Say ""But bro what about the future?😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭"" Idc the future dawg all are crying for stuffs who didn't Even happened already like if is the fucking End of the world jeez..."
It makes sense when she's in the party but why the hell does it activate when she's not?
Useless passive
"If they remove the global it's fine
But it activating without her in the team is too much
imagine if Sparkle's sp cap increase was global"
I thought a standard character already does that
"mydei infinite res, castorice death god 1 rez global MADGE MADGE MADGE"
"""Lore Fits her and her Power because they MADE IT SOOO!!!!"""
"typical hoyoverse,and the bumbass hoyoshills"
Bladie: my disappoint is immeasurable and my day is ruined
I spit and vomit on anyone defending this disgusting mechanic.
" @Sputnik_Man  imagine getting killed by castorice after traveling and her butterflies revives you, at that point just walk into the sun man"
"E6 Bailu in the team and Castorice in you account

You'll have to suffer for another day"
Meanwhile Bailu:
"Don't cry little hsr fan, uncle hoyoverse got enough powercreep to make you pull every upcoming character for the rest your entire life

hey Dawei, get in the new predatory mechanics, the boy's hungry"
I have bailu and she can revive too 1 unit per game i know castorice no need to be in team but when bailu revive give like 1/ 1/2hp but event with it you can easily die. Thats 1hp from castorice is bad. Your unit still die turn later. So castorice revive is bad in my opinion
It's a bullshit mechanic. It's supposed to be challenging and rewarding to clear the harder content in the game. Now the game has an absurd cheat like mechanic that doesnt even require that character in the team? Endgame content might as well be called casual content.
There are unironically people who think this is not a cause for concern... Ever heard of the boiling frog metaphor?
If this is the way to introduce global pasive they did it wrong they've should start with a character that let you skip the history never to less still a scummy practice.
WILD HUNT
My question is why can she revive people when her power is to cause death to anyone she touches- (someone pls explain)
I mean i was gonna pull for Castorice anyway so i'll just enjoy that bonus.
Glad I quit. The power creep was obvious months ago and I got sick of Hoyo giving special treatment to some characters while making others crap. RIP Jiaoqiu
"Seems weird if it works even when she's not on the team. Should work like Bailu's revive, no?

And how come Kiana and Seele don't have this ability when they also have the Authority of Death, Mihoyo? It's so pesky when Kiana gets KO'd in the middle of a combo. Especially in the Herrscher Trio team, and then their joint techniques no longer work because they're all on her Skill page."
"Pay to win? 
Jokes on you im into that shit"
"This can work on the condition of her needin to be on the team makes the ability work. Havin it happen without her bein in the team doesnt make any sense, its just breaks the concept of the Strategy part of this turn based game. I bet if they had it where it only happens when she is on the team, then thered be less issues."
Bro no one is forcing anyone to anything
"The argument that it alligns with her lore is so easily invalidated. Just make it a passive while she is on the battlefield, that would be totally fine.

Also I dont think the ability in itself is currently a problem in a vacuum. (It becomes a problem once they start designing  content with that in mind) but the way bigger problem is the premise of global effects on characters even when they are not in the team. Iirc according to leaks a group of characters will have those kinds of abilities but with stat boosts instead and I think these, depending on the stat, are way better than castorias."
Bailu has been my only healer since 1.0 and has had free revive since the start. She boosts max hp and reduced damage taken when allies have regen on so...dont think Im trading her in yet
"We are not this games targeted market.

CN Loves Pay for Power.
So Unfortunately EN is only Crying.

Love Lore, big lore Nut here and all but Damn you can’t excuse this for lore Significance. 

And I’m a Dolphin who is going to pull for E1S1 Castorice and I’m still extremely unhappy with this choice.

EN need to understand they really dont care about our options. Saddly /:"
"Turn based games is literally one of the most powercreep prone genre in gacha and yet some people still wanna support this 😂
havent yall learn from silverwolf? she was so so broken on release that she literally caused the ever increasing powercreep in the game cuz they keep inflating every enemy ending with the game pumping out so many characters and supports to counteract the damage she made in the games balance lmao

Id love to see yall telling people to pull for a random ahh character in the future just because they give plus +30% crit damage in youtube and twitter comments! NEVER undermine these little things even if you think the first and only current global passive is useless for you
you never know hmm?"
Honestly think ppl r complaining too much. If she revives a character when not on the team then just restart the fight cuz it’s something u would’ve had to do either way if she wasn’t on the team.
"just imagine if she didn't have this passive, people would start to say things like
""Uhhhh... i would pull for her if she had something that has something to do with her lore... like a revive or something yk""
they are just annoying"
So basically Bailu but better
Global passives are trying to force people to pull even if you are not planning to use the character
"First of all, it’s one time, so it’s not like it’s the end of the world. Think of almost doubling the go of one character. That’s it. That’s the passive.

Two, who cares if it “breaks the meta.” It’s a story based game with zero multiplayer elements.

Three, if you complaining because it “makes the game easier,” then so what. It FOMO for sure if you don’t pull her, but  it was FOMO with Acheron or Aventurine too.

Four, if anyone doesn’t see an issue in this it’s kinda an issue and it kinda isn’t. We don’t know the future of Star Rail so sure there’s a lot of unknowns, but we can’t say exactly what Hoyo’s intentions are. I’m optimistic that HOYO will treat this like adding any other character to the game.

Five, “its a global passive, it works even when she isn’t in the team.” Yet again, so what. It all depends on how Hoyo treats the game moving forward. And this isn’t as meta breaking as you might think.

Six, stop hating each other over this. Everyone is at each other over speculations that this is the end of the world and Star Rail is dying. It’s not. Nothing has proven that.

Just stop hating each other. If you hate the game that much or you hate the addition of a global passive then quit the game. If your just gonna complain that the devs hate you, quit the game. If you think Hoyo is doing this and setting a bad precedent for the future, QUIT THE GAME. 

(But then again, the boycott didn’t work with Genshin so my guess is most of you would keep playing anyways)."
let's see how long it takes them to add skins that provide permanent stat boosts like in all those shit mobile gachas
I wouldn’t mind if it didn’t work in the endgame modes
"мастхев?пассивка которая воскрешает 1 персонажа?выбейте хиллеров лучше,чтобы эти персонажи не умирали.пассивка кастории просто прикольный прикол,но никак не мастхев"
"Personally, I don’t really mind her global passive since I’m set on pulling for her regardless. Her design and lore really interests me and I love her dragon memosprite that she has. In all honesty, I don’t really think her global revive will make that much of a different for the endgame content, considering it’s just a one time revive at 1hp like bailu passive. 

Though, that being said I can understand people’s opinion and frustration towards Castorice’s global passive, it does enable possibility for future chars to have global passives of their own that could be meta breaking, but that’s only a hypothetical scenario. I think people are over-exaggerating with mentioning power-creep and describing her as a 'must pull'. It’s too many what if’s scenarios and she’s not even out yet. On another note, no one is forcing anyone to pull for her banner and they should pull for whoever they want and enjoy the game."
"I mean I like castorice, she seems cool. My issue is that it sets a standard, and as we’ve seen with HSR, will only go UP from here. It’d be different if it just applied when she was in a team."
NOW IMAGINE... a new character that unlocks one eidolon for the entire party. but its locked behind E2
"""Lore"" doesn't excuse broken game mechanics. Despite it's story HSR is still a game and needs to be balanced properly. I'd be okay with leaving this kind of global passive if the previous characters start getting rebalanced and buffed up to match and make them relevant again, and there's hope for that at least a little given Hoyo has said they're going to look into rebalancing and buffing old characters."
I see wifey I click video
I think this shouldn't be put in the game at all
"Look me in the eyes..i don't care
I pull bad charchter and then not use them and i don't even pull meta you think i care if she is must have or not(well im just saying the passive is fine idc even if it doesn't exsit i don't mind i enjoy charchter)"
"not to hate on the people who are complaining about it, but if you fail to clear MoC or other combat related content without a character dying, youre just not doing enough damage anyways to clear it, the only people that will actually benefit from this are either very new players, or just people who dont farm that often."
"I quit and deleted the game 3 weeks ago specifically due to her passive. If hoyoverse relents and removes it and adds a skip button to story cutscenes, I may return to HSR"
This is my thing they get brought back with 1 HP so if u don't heal them quick they are just gonna die again
"I was going to pull for Castorice, but now I don't want to. I like losing in fights! That passive just takes the fun/exitement out of it for me. Why is it constant? can't there be like a seitch to turn it on or off?"
"I am sorry but if people are complaining about p2w in a gacha game, then they have never played one at all or ar ebunch of tourists. considering ALL gacha will and do have p2w aspects to them, just a matter of time."
"I'm so happy I stopped playing star rail.
The power creep system really doesn't give you any freedom.
My wallet thanked me."
"I think its because its the firrts to have that passive, later on, new characters will have passive skills that could buff allies or debuff enemies, but right now its because its new"
Lore wise but where the game will end with broken skills like this? More and more meta will make the game impossible to follow being f2p
"Dies-> Revives at 1HP, Dies again from DoT

Edit: I might still pull on her anyway as I only just started this game as of 3.1 and uhh….id like to have replace qingque???"
"I think people forgot boss enemies take two turns, effect ain’t too strong"
You must have terrible builts for characters to say she is p2w. You know? You could revive your whole team even before Castorice when pressing the reset battle button
The problem is that its locked behind a character
"""Vergil is not broken, Hes lore accurate"" ahh moment"
I'm sorry but it's not like you HAVE to go for her? If you want her get her if you don't just don't I don't see the logic to hate her for it 💀 literally the incarnation of death ofc she'd be able to do something like this is mean? Should've made sense no?
"Starts with her passive, we later get atk boost etc"
"If they still want it to work globally. Maybe atleast nerf it in Endgame content where it become party-wide instead, but thats my opinion"
IDFC I pull every char and weapons for 100% collection
"I think it really only affects meta
And so I can't say I care"
"If leaks are to be believed (it was labeled as Reliable but the part about it being available in Abyss was labeled as Questionable), new 5* Genshin character, Escoffier, is able to summon a pot that works in Abyss so she can make a dish that increases atk and cd. It’s tied to one of her passives. She can only make a certain number of dishes before you have to wait 7 days though. That means you’d have to get Escoffier in order to make this dish to make the endgame easier. So, I highly doubt the global buff from Castorice is gonna go away if similar things are being added to other Hoyo games.

I kinda figured this would happen eventually."
"How is this a problem? You pull or you don't, you'll be aight"
"Doing a global passive:

Genshin's imaginarium theater: 👍
Hsr character: 😵

I hope the powercreep in Star Rail doesn't start to go way more out of hand this time 😓."
Idc is she's a powercreep people should be grateful and stop complaining!
I mean..nobody is forcing them to pay
"It's so bad, and they know what they are doing and the people who don't see anything bad. You're blind 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️"
"People who support this are just dumb and wrong. Firstly her passive isn't even a huge issue by itself. The problem is the precedence this sets on the game. Global passives just for owning a character without them being on the team just a terrible idea. 

Its all cool now because you want Castorice but wait till its a character you hate and dont want that gives your entire team shields periodically for just existing in your account. Or a character that gives everyone a free 15 speed. or a character that randomly gives someone energy. 

its just a shit idea for any game. And if you think this is the only time they are going to do this global passive mechanic, I have a bridge to sell you. This is dumb and should not be tolerated. Again its fine if it didn't work in endgame content which is designed to be challenging but from everything we've seen it does."
I want her but I don't have the game
"In deed it's a powerfull skill, however it's also part of the lore and unique in the game. Don't talk ^$@ about a character skill, it's just a mere skill in a huge game overflowing in content."
So when ur having any in vulnerability u don’t count as a player on the objective so when u lose hulk form and go to banner ur immortal so ur not on point
"The reason players are angry is because of the flipping precedent of the future global passives.

It's hilarious that the whole frustration is built on a bunch of "" what-if-ism """
"It maybe a weird take but if they implement these global passives to character majority of players will summon for, i dont think its as bad. For example, 90% of players with an abundance of jades will summon for castorice. Another example is if this feature is used again and given to phainon. Like who tf in their right minds will skip phainon lol?"
 @Curiosity-Kitten  are u dumb lol you cant eat food buffs in abyss/ theater/ endgame content
I mean being able to cook in the abyss doesn’t really help you since you still can’t eat it
" @creativecontent3664  Unless it’s part of her passive and she just eats it in the middle of abyss without use of a gadget. Like I said though, it was a Questionable leak."
" @Curiosity-Kitten nah the leaks are real, ur just dumb. cus somehow you end up thinking that a character could use their exploration passive in abyss"
All I see are Unique kits that are important to the plot just like acheron
"This is just powercreep at it again. People be like this hasn't happened before.

Remember Acheron?"
"Honestly I highly doubt there will be any more global passives, and if there are I also highly doubt it will be related to damage(Please let this comment age well)"
Why are people mad about it I’m not getting it bc you don’t even have to have her in the team for that to work which is overpowered and good
Danjin: Powercreep? What is that?
"the buff aint that good tbh, i get hating globals i do but more of i'd hate it if it was a dmg enhancing skill. survival issues should never happen anyway and if it can happen once good chance ur team was gonna die again unless u died like at 1% or something.

and for those worried about them just going to keep adding more yeah i can see that being concerning but good news is, 3.2 (second half), 3.3, 99% likely 3.4 wont and 99% 3.5 also wont have any globals in any characters kits so these globals either are gonna be a super rare thing for a characters if it happens again that is. but given they made a custom ui for global passives i dont doubt there may be another in the long future"
Let's be honest. The passive itself DOES NOT MATTER. It's the fact that there is a passive like that to begin with which opens to door to more egregious global passives to follow it.  It's been the topic of outrage for a while now and anyone who's pretending that it's a problem only now is a fool.
And the world kept spinning. Anyways i hope they keep it
"this video is kinda missing the point. the problem is not the passive itself, like aa revive ok. but THE CONCEPT of a global passive is not good cause they can add more and more and passives can include dmg bonus, crit bonus, speed bonus etc. and then hoyo balance endgame around that then it will not be good. hoyo has proven to be able to powercreep mecanics (example: topaz numby and herta technique)"
did the revive cleansed debuff?
Dont pull her if you dont like her passive
"Having castorice to counter hoolay, but forgot that hoolay on his enchanted state"
bro they just mad cause they pulled for mydie 😂
anyways free ruan mei❤
"when she's part of the party, sure, you could tie into her lore since she's basically death incarnate, so she could control death... but global seems a bit overkill..."
It is really not good. That’s what msjes character broken in a bad way 😢
"People is overreacting a lot, this isn't that big of a deal, powercreep WILL happen from one way or another, of course it's wrong to have this mechanic around, but compared to a character that has busted scalling and makes every single team look the same I think that I prefer this.

""But you'll have to pull this new global passive or else your account will be worse"" 
Yes, but we WILL have to pull in every single case, it's like complaining that you can't clear MOC with seele and 1.0 supports. It's a gacha, not a balanced jrpg, there will always be powercreep that force us to pull better characters. Like, can't you all just save for that unexisting global passive??? There is a bigger picture, but that picture is realizing where you are standing on, you are literally complaining about the MAIN monetization method of the game, avoiding this passive style won't avoid powercreep, you are just asking for them to sugarcoat it..."
It's nice but if you dieng you don't need cash you'd need skill😂😂😂
"If I'm dying during a battle i AM dying again cause im not ready for it lol, i think i can count on my fingers the number of times a revive could actually have saved me"
"If it's okay bc of lore accurate, they should buff Seele so she can dodge all enemy attacks. Dude, lorewise Seele is faster than sniper bullet. it is 1200 meter PER SECOND without trying."
This is such a bad argument cause all I need to say is this genshin and zzz have barely been criticised for their level as power creep as much as SR. And your arguments are just missing the point of why people are mad powercreep is always inevitable but when it's every other week in a game like this it's not very good. Global passives are now just making this situation worse. Like genshin hasn't had as much of a power creep problem then star rail has and that game has been out for over 4 years and star rail has been out for nearly 2 and that's just maddening cause there a prime example of how it works but they are just choosing not to do it. Your excuses are just literally please don't stop insulting my game you're hurting my feelings at this point
"​ @teddyisaliar271  it's faster because we are getting characters at a faster rate, in that case they should add less characters per patch, but we won't be able to make them change their mind because we already had a patch with just one new character and it sold less than the rest.

I'm comparing both bad routes, and I think that global passives are less worse than keeping powercreeping every single patch. I don't expect them to change their ways of design drastically when they know that making kits overloaded is working. I hope that if they keep the global passive route they try to at leats making it a slot where you put 1 character to support the team. (and add a f2p option to put there)

I hate both cases and I know that we all want the game to improve but you can't expect them to literally choose to lose money.

I would love for them to stop the HP inflation but they won't. For me at least it hasn't been a problem, I can complete every single endgame mode full stars and I haven't expended a single dollar on this game, people is doing pull less accounts and can get to 2 stars on MOC 12, so I guess that everyone should try checking their builds or invest their jades in a better team that doesn't require them to optimize it or read enemy mechanics."
" @dikikai5983  okay this is just all kinds of wrong and self centered and ignoring alot of factors.

 Okay first off the thing is just a bad cause know what other game pulls has 2 banners and doesn't no one talks about powercreep? ZZZ cause it's not a problem so it can be done and the last part is just the poor rich company excuse

And comparing both routes? Both routes are bad cause they are both intertwined. Cause if we have to live with the constant powercreep is adding global passives which we fully know is gonna be exploited really a great idea for this game? People have already called it greedy so now is it fair people are just gonna get an immediate disadvantage cause a character just exists? Even then they get powercrept there passives are just gonna be there and I'm the near future when it all gets stacked it gonna be so not new player and returning player friendly cause of the hp inflation and all the mechanics unless you whip out the bank card and get spending. 

If you hate both cases then why are you literally going out of your way to justify and defend it and make out people are overreacting when this is a serious problem for the near future and lose out on money? You do realise this can be a double edged sword cause people can just drop the game instead and say enough is enough.

And the last part is literally the worst part. I haven't had a problem so I think it's okay and other people should get good and make better choices and look at themselves...what???????? Do you even know what your saying? Let's break it down. You literally went I haven't had this problem therefore its not really a problem. Yes for you new players and returning this definitely isn't a problem cause you missed out and you are gonna pay for it cause you haven't been keeping up with the meta. Check their builds? You make it out to be like it's something we can control yes let me just ask get relics from the hand of god and I'm sure he'll deliver oh wait I can't cause the whole system is rng what bad defence. Invest their jade's better???? Yes let's invest our jade's fully knowing hoyo can easily just decide to change how the game works and then that character is useless hey remember sparkle well guess what she's useless now cause we going all in on the break meta now so hurry up and catch up again a terrible defence. Enemy mechanics... really what's that you invested all your jade's into the lastest 5* black swan and wanting to use your Kafka dot team well sorry but you see the current moc and endgame content is revolving around break and follow up attack and it's gonna be like this for the next few patches so even tho you lost hard pity and lost all your jade's go get firefly and ruan mei to have a chance. 

Do you actually see how flawed your reasoning is? Your defences are literally don't mean to the big company, I understand this is a bad situation but this is kinda actually your fault for not getting good rng on relics and poorly investing your jade's even though hoyo can decide to change how the game functions any moment on a whim.

Just stop already you literally lost all creditability when you said I understand this is bad but decided to justify and defend it and make out people are the problem cause they can't predict the future"
"​ @teddyisaliar271  You can't say that is unplayable when there are literally zero cycles done with e0s1 or e0s0 and what's your excuse for people being able to have zero pull accounts and still make it to 3 stars from time to time? it's a resource management game, you can't complete it? you failed at it. As easy as that.

Aside from that, is powercreep really that big of a deal ? I mean, would you leave the game only because you couldn't complete MOC with 3 stars? because I think if the only thing avoiding you leaving the game are like 90 jades per patch then yeah leave, you are not enjoying the other 99% of the game.

And why so annoyed of a random comment on a short, to the point where you literally make up a narrative about how I ""was defending hoyo and felt bad because you attacked the game"" when I literally said that I don't liked the idea, but at least it wasn't that bad and it still depends on Hoyo if they make it busted or balanced. Aside from that, do you think that hoyo's looking for feedback here? they don't care about us,  when has the english community gotten anything out of their complains? Castorice sells will be high anyway, and we can't do anything about that, if that's their green light to keep making global passives."
"@dikikai5983  okay the first comment literally just showed you just ignored everything I said. Like you really think people can just choose who they get and want? You really think they can always be prepared when they suddenly change meta? You really think everyome can get lucky in pulls and relic's?

Is it really a big of a deal...jesus Christ you are literally ignoring the whole point of this whole discussion. Power creep on games is bad the whole point of playing a game is for challenge and enjoyment and if the game is literally becoming unenjoyable because the game is getting really bad with how it's handling said game. You are literally doing it again you just ignoring the whole point of the discussion. 

And annoyed? Who said I'm annoyed I'm just baffled at people like yourself cause your logic makes no sense cause again you say you understand why people are not happy, I called out how your messages come across and you just ignore what I say to fit your own narrative. And your whole things is they won't care so I'm just gonna accept and again justify and blame other people for it? And again you still fail to understand you just go well rn it's not that bad and that's the point look at powercreep it's already bad and if you really think that global passives ain't gonna be a it's a just maybe it will be then idk what to say also I didn't make up a narrative this is literally what you said yourself. You literally just went I know it's a problem but I'll justify it regardless. Just at this point just stop if this is just a comment on a short just don't bother then"
" @teddyisaliar271  You still didn't mention why people CAN make it with 0 pulls. Personally I'm baffled of people that are going to quit because they can't get a star or two per patch. You'll got so far with this game just to say ""HOYO MAKE EVERY SINGLE TEAM VIABLE OR I'LL LEAVE"" that's a tantrum and shows that you aren't enjoying the game, most of the content isn't even endgame, so why bother if you only will enjoy 5% of it, at that point that became a job."
"@dikikai5983  0 pulls yea I don't believe that at all cause that just sounds like you making stuff up. And you are baffled cause of that reason? Again you MISSING THE POINT. No one is asking making all teams viable. People are asking stop the power creep, give characters a chance, stop changing the meta on a whim, give characters an actual chance to shine or idk add a character who can actually help older characters. It's not just about a star it's about the potential state of the game what are you literally failing to understand here? Now you just contradicted yourself cause you clearly show you have no idea what's going on here. So just stop you are just a hypocrite at this rate"
" @teddyisaliar271  Go and do a google search, there are many accounts doing 0 pulls. If they can, you can. git gud :P"
Well what ever pulls I have for her are going to her but im done spending anything else the game had a good run for me but not anymore if the story doesnt pick up from here and its still mid thats that ananta and arkK is coming soon so time to peace out while the power creep is still fresh
"honestly, on brand for her lore."
I hope we get one copy of her for free tied to story progress
Womp womp
"I like it, i want it, i need it 💚 What I would expect from Firefly's love rival."
Lol I don't give a FUCK if it's pay to win I just want her cause she's cool and adorable as hell
"To me as long it isn't States or big then it is fine, no that 100 shield at the start if the battle isn't broken, that 100 flat def is tho. Like imagine the new healer just gives 10% outgoing healing bonus that would be op.

But to me as long they don't make them stack/don't make them too strong then i don't mind it, i have played hi3rd and they have the Divine key system which gives you buffs based on if you get some specific weapons, you don't need the have them to clear the endgame content tho (maybe they changed in part 2, last time i played was when fu hua got a new battle suit.)"
"I love that THIS is the final straw for players. Not Silver Wolf who gave enemies a weakness that they didn't have in order for it to make it easier to break their shields. Not Ruan Mei who gave you crazy buffs to break through opponents a lot more easier. Not Robin who have your team an forward attack, but also does crazy attack damage buffs for your characters. Not Firefly who gives the enemy an automatic fire weakness when using her skill. Not Acheron who was the first crazy damage DPS character we actually got. Not Sunday who boots us forward and our little pets that we take into battle. Not Fugue who automatically gives us super break and gives the enemy a 2nd shield break for massive bonus damage. Not Tribi who needed C1 or C2 to do crazy amounts of team wide damage. I forgot which one it is. But now this is the final straw. All I have to say to people getting upset about this is.....get the fu*k outta here with this bullshit bruh. The game has always been predatory. The game has always had ""must pulls"" Ruan Mei being probably the longest running one until Fugue came out."
"The fact that you're trying to present this as if it's even a debate on whether this is even a possibility that it's ok 💀

Grow some guts and stop fence sitting"
Just skip if you hate it
Idk i have a guarantee
"What do you mean she's a must have now? I'm just fine with my Aventurine, always ending fights with full HP on everyone 😂"
"Yeah I'm not going to lie, shit like this is probably going to kill Star Rail"
"the reason why people are against the global passive is because this opens up the possibility that future characters have global passives as well, and with hsr’s history of power creeping within a couple of patches, this could lead to global passives being way too powerful for the game, leading to the end-game content being centred around these global passives which will essentially lock anyone who doesn’t have these characters out of endgame content"
They probably want users to use the free rolls on her :v Thats why they are pushing her so much
Nah y'all hating too much it ain't game changing nor mandatory
Wait are you saying that even if she isn't in the team character will be revived?!
"The problem was and it has never been the passive itself as its kinda useless in endgame, but how unfair its to being active even without Cas on the team and the horrific precedent it makes to future characters and global passives."
"Lore accurate my @$$, Hoyo made this lore of hers."
"idc, it's just a single player idle game. It doesn't matter if it's op or not as long it's a single player game."
People are overreacting it's literally 1 hp you could get revived at the worst time and essentially waste it lol
"Oh no. A pay to win character? In a gatcha game? Never! 

Almost like every other HSR character that power creeps the previous... or that they have never balanced the endgame around who is currently on banner..."
It dosen't bother me tbh. I think thats fine because she is a anniversary Character. The last anniversary character could kill every monster on the map or in the Simu which makes so many things easier and safes a lot of time. But that was okay for the Community now the people just overreact in my opnion but well thats just my opnion.
Bruh why does EVERYONE forget about bailu being able to do the same and at higher hp to
"The thing is, I understand that people think it ""opens the Pandora's box"" and ""we're gonna get passives that increase crit and energy soon"" and other things like that...but will we really? Maybe I'm putting too much faith in Hoyo but the global passive is attached to Castorice, an anniversary character - they're supposed to be special like that. We also got a pretty damn broken technique with Acheron who was an anniversary character (imo much more fomo ability than what Castorice has, revive is pretty inconsequential if you have a well built team)

Hoyo definitely heard the playerbase is not happy with the global passive but decided to give it to her anyways, now we just need to wait and see what they do with it in the future - for all we know she could be the only character with a global passive and this all will be forgotten in a few months time, maybe they'll give global passives to everyone and make it a gameplay feature by only allowing you to have 3 global passives of your choice or something like that, either way we don't know what will happen but I'm willing to give them the benefit of doubt until then. I'm still having fun with the game so this is nothing to quit over for me."
Having this global passive is amazing and I don't mind how broken is it.
I’m glad they kept the passive a didn’t cave for streamers making a big deal
Cant wait for when we can debuff so much enemy acheron no need stacking to use ult
"Idk if anyone's gonna see or read this but I'm going to say it anyway.

HSR is probably the same track with HI3rd. Where powercreep is at its worst and old S ranks (5 star equivalent) characters are not only unusable but literally forgotten to the point hoyo gives them for free. It has already started with Ruan Mei and Luocha from the 3.2 livestream, and they will probably continue. 

For me, Global buffs are definitely broken and maybe should not be in the game and I will agree if it is the case for a game with pvp feature. The thing is, HSR is a single player game and there's literally no need for competitiveness to enjoy it. So Global buffs meant nothing but having an easier time clearing endgame contents. If you're worried about not getting every jades from MOC, APOC and PF, then get what you can and strategize your pull. No one's forcing you to pull every characters, no one's forcing you to top up, and no one's forcing you to clear every endgame content. So just do your own thing in the game and if you don't enjoy it anymore just leave it.

I literally don't understand this drama cause why are you all worrying when you don't even need to be competitive in this game and Castorice will probably get powercreep again in the future. This is a gacha game with Honkai in its title. If you don't play HI3 then just know that the powercreep is gonna get worse. So be prepared and do your math for your pulls."
"Doesn't matter if it's tide to the lore or not. Unfortunately the door, that this global passive opens, is just too huge to ignore. 
If Hoyoverse would say, ""It's okay, we will never use it again, because it is tied to the anniversary character."" Then I'd be less pestimistic.
But we are talking about Hoyoverse, and leaks already comfirmed multiple global passive characters coming.
Worse is, if this character sells well, wich she probably will, other gacha corporations will get a peek out of it. Meaning that there is a very good chance, that Hoyoverse just released a cancer into the gacha genre, infecting all future games as well.
As long as they get away with it, other companies will try to do same, scumy and greedy methods as well.

Now, all characters will feel like, that they are a must pull. Wich makes the game, wich is already pretty predatory, into even more predatory.
Big sad."
"Saying it's lore accurate is literally the most pathetic excuse possible,if you really want to make it lore accurate then just make her intakill enemies when entering battle,get Trianne out of Tribbie's animation,make Jingliu do 30 times the damage,completly change Sparkle kit while you're at it,give Aventurine his pseudo emanator powers,make silver wolf actually able to just erase enemies,make Kafka control enemies and make Blade immortal

Those are just people trying to defend a character they like,if it was someone they didn't like they would be angry too,she didn't even need this passive to work when she's out of the team,if it only worked on battle it would be 👍,but they had to make it global

And I'm actually curious about something,is there a reason people actually like her? Or was it just because yes? We don't know shit about her,the most she did on the story quest was talking with Cerces and pulling the FlameReaver into the Century Gate and that's about it,most of the time she's just doing things for Aglaea

If someone could explain the Castorice hype I would be grateful👍"
"For me it's good if it's JUST a Castorice thing and don't influence that much on the battle itself, now when we get a global crit dmg buff, then it starts to be a problem"
they can either limit how much global passive you can use or disable it in end game content. they haven't done neither in beta
It's NOT the strength of the ability that people are upset about. It's the precedent that this now sets into place that is
"I'm fine with it since it's Castorice and all, but I hope this isn't going to be a precedent. Imagine a really good global passive on some IPC filth or something, that'd be horrendous."
Thank God the didn't take it away
"i honestly dont care, i play for the story and obtain characters that i like and will def pull for cas shes so pretty!
update: i got cas yeppiiee!"
Yes lore i hope they start makin mc now 1 hit enemie into oblivion fore the lore 😆
"Not even the literal gods, or archons, in genshin had this ability."
Should I pull for Castorice or Jiaoqiu? I got 60+ tickets right now.
"Yeah, we deffinetly will. Think abou acheron kind of charge or Silver Wolf's weakness insertion."
When has your 'if it's just a X thing' thing ever come true in gacha gaming. There is already a leaked character with global passive in his kit and 2 more in the works and all of them one after the other. Even certain Collab character has one.
"@Riyozsu  I should have guessed... And let me guess, global passive is about crit stats right?"
"​@ItzSmoof it can be worse, waaay worse...
What if global passives stacks? Like, if you have ""A"" you get a permanent 30 speed boost, if you have ""B"" you get a 10% crit rate and crit damage boost, if you have ""C"" you receive 1 SP per turn, if you have ""D"" you receive 10% healing every round. If you have all of them, you just receive a permanent 30 speed boost, 10% healing,10% crit rate and crit damage and 1 SP.

I just want to adress that Star Rail still a game that plays around the last char launched to its max. So what if this becomes the new standard?"
Yep. Hsr is already horrible with power creep. This adds another level in that can easily make it so much worse.
"It completely nullifies the other 5* supports that can revive teammates. If she HAD to be in the team I wouldn't mind it much, but not even having to be on the team is ridiculous. NOT TO MENTION her whole lore is tied to DEATH, as in bringing it, not reversing it. If they actually go through with this it'll be the dumbest thing I've ever seen a gatcha game do, they still have time to get rid of it. 

I've wanted to pull for her since I saw her from the start, I was drawn to her design and lore immediately. I still do, but I don't wanna condone this ngl. I'll still probably pull her, but it won't be bc of the passive, I just like her character all around. I also want Hyacine, so I hope they don't give her some ridiculously op ability."
" @error404webpagenotfound  same, I do intend to pull for her but not for the passive whatsoever"
I hope they make a character that boost all ally crit so I dont have to rely much on RNG for good stat
"​ @error404webpagenotfound Bad news: they can't change it anymore, it's now on the official livestream. If this is adjusted, Hoyoverse might be sued by the Chinese server for fraud"
Due to her Authority over death it's likely she is able to revive someone as well but has been killing people due to her being neglected and not having the power to control it. It might still be lore accurate. That said I don't think it is busted at all but imagine we someday get Anaxas or Silver Wolf's weakness implant as global passives or who knows what...
Exactly.
"Fr bro, people say that her global passive is no biggie. Wait till hoyo release global passive that increase dmg, cr, or cd in the future"
"@sairenji7807  From what I heard they have a global passive of speed, crit rate, and damage lined up so that sounds like fun! XD"
"It doesn't set presidance for shit dude. ""Oh no, global passive of 1 HP revive."" And everyone instantly cries pay to win.

Cut the bullshit. Seriously. Crying about something that is honestly situational as fuck and isn't as good at first glance and then going out of your way to review bomb is the most sociopathic behavior on par with the political bullshit that goes on these days.

Stfu and actually see how it works out when it lands, THEN make a decision. Judging shit before it even lands. I swear these people grew up becoming either the most spoiled or the most unnecessarily angry little children."
The precedent it sets it a global revive at 1 health. That is tiny in the grand scheme of things and I can’t wait for everyone to be like wow we were wrong it isn’t game changing or precedent setting.
"@ethanowen4590  no, that's not what it sets. Missed the point entirely"
@ but what comes of this in the future as the straw that breaks the camels back? A speed boost globally or an attack boost cause what this shows is that it’ll be below 5% if you take a full revive at 1 health as the precedent.
@ethanowen4590  a global passive that gives crit boosts or weakness implants? You tell me. It shouldn't be a thing
@ ok let’s say you get a global passive that gives a crit boost it would be small and negligible at best cause castorice as a precedent means that everything will be ok i have it neat not a oh god i need to pull for her or ill lose every moc thing
" @ethanowen4590  characters shouldn't be giving boosts for outside of their party, and let's be real here. It's hoyoverse. I wouldn't put it past them to add a passive so broken that it trivializes content"
"@ I mean yeah but also what do you expect them to do? Cause let’s say they curb power creep right how do they do that realistically? You make Acheron, Mydei, and Blade all the same level. Imma just pull two dps and call it a day. A ton of supports would be gutted like Adventurine would have to be annihilated cause he is the root cause of all this. There’s no solution and global passives can curb it IE make a global passive that debuff the team but gives them a buff in another area in return."
 @ethanowen4590  Listen to that one word. 'Scheme' You sound and the rest of the haters sound ridiculous.
 @ethanowen4590  Wahhh is all I hear right now. Do you hear how ridiculous you sound? Karen
 @SilverDwarven  No I hit the nail on the head.
 @bait644  who are you
@ethanowen4590  global passives will create an imbalance and only further the currently extreme power creep
 @SilverDwarven  No it won't.
@bait644  how so?
🤣
" @SilverDwarven  If you can't see how crazy you all sound, then I can't help you. There is no point is having a discussion with people who refuse to actually hear the other points."
"@bait644  I literally just asked you to explain, tf are you on about?"
" @bait644  To explain and hope you understand. One is better than zero right? So if you have one and another person has zero the other person has less and is behind. So if someone has something that provides something without even needing them on the team then that is a passive boost that the person with zero wouldn't have, making their account worth less than the person with the one. I agree that the current global passive isn't the greatest, but what's stopping them from putting a character with a terrible global and making a few eidolons that make that passive better? Let's use an example I saw earlier, crit damage. What if they increased your teams crit rate by 5%, but if you got them to E2 it increases to 15%, then E6 doubles it to 30%. Now you have a must pull for crit teams that doesn't even need to be on your team. A must pull that you have to get six other times I may add. It's a scam to make people spend more money on their game. I'm personally skipping global passive banners, but that's just me. Do what you want and think how you want, but this will become a bigger issue in the future if nothing's done about it."
I think hoyo will add a enemy that instantly kills a character on turn 1 and this passive will become mandatory to get full gems in endgame. GOOD LUCK IF YOU SKIP HER hoyo is selling you the fix to a problem you never thought existed.
​ @sairenji7807 The most bonkers passive will be SPD. Imagine a GP that boost speed by +5.
"⁠ @sairenji7807  “people say her global passive is no biggie” Because it is??? the issue isn’t Cas having one (even if it’s good, realistically you won’t need it a lot if you play well), it’s the existence of it and more in the future."
"​​ @watchandliveforever The next enemy will instantly drop your team HP to 1.. it's basically to sell burst healer and Castorice.. well doesn't matter tho. Just another cheap boring gimmick even ape can solve.

What matters is that we knew that 3.3 will see another 20% HP padding on end game content. Much fun, such creative, very original! Can't wait for %damage bonus global passive!!"
@caramelcwossont ?? It's literally what i say
 @JeSt4m  I'm saying they added this global passive for a reason. I 100% see it having instant death in the future and the response from hoyo will be its a global passive so you dont even need castorice in your team to negate it. Just have her on your account! Even meta gamers wont be able to survive without it if its instant death on turn 1. Theres a reason they made it global passive and not limited to her being in your team its to add instant death mechanic ingame for the future. Its called selling a fix to a problem that doesnt exist.
 @ethanowen4590 the speed boost global passive is 50% donkey
"@watchandliveforever  Instant death won't come without certain gimmick we can do to prevent it.. unless it's from an optional hidden boss. Instant death attack in Turn Based RPG is pretty common, it's just that it's usually came from ultra rare mini-boss mob or secret hidden/optional boss. Anyway as long as the gimmick is good I don't mind.

Even as shitty as HoYo is I still believe that they're not greedy enough to do something that bad like making unavoidable party wipe that cannot be prevented. If they actually go that way that'll pretty much be the decisive evidence that HoYo is officially the worst and greediest game company in the world.

P.S : In more hardcore TB-RPG instant death, OTK, or anything similar is actually pretty normal. If you played SMT, wizardry or other roguelike game even modern one like Darkest Dungeon.. Getting your party wiped out randomly is pretty common.

Well those game are not gacha tho.. almost."
 @JeSt4m  Well we wont know for certain Its just one of the reasons im making sure i get atleast a copy of her just incase. It would suck to find out I need her later on and be stuck waiting for a rerun lol
" @zogar8526  I don’t see why people complain about powercreep in hoyo, it’s been that way since gun girl z and isn’t going to stop"
" @error404webpagenotfound castorice according to lore represents the death titans hand of life , her sister pollixia or the dragon is the hand of death 
So u are wrong about her lore"
"""Precendent"" 
bro this has been there since day 1"
 @l4rkdono  explain then plz
I hate this feature. I pulled her and can’t undone. HSR is gonna get less fun
"@watchandliveforever  Nah, they already catered to Castorice. Now they'll be catering to the next few characters they release. If you spent money for Castorice get ready to spend more!"
Bailu powercreep aahh
there are greater problems out there then crying over gacha games...please take your energy somewhere else and quit those kind of games jeeeeez
"Passive cool, global passive not cool
Was already gonna get her anyways but it sets some form of precedent where you'll wanna go after every character after to get their global passives if they decide to go through with it

Powercreep is also crazy as bailu can only revive while on the team but castorice can just do it without being on the team, halfway across the universe sipping on some apple juice"
As long as it’s something benign and not a stat buff i genuinely don’t care. The genshin glazers should have stopped this bullcrap when certain characters gave quality of life travel features as part of their kit. “Oh you want to fly? Gotta get wanderer. Oh you want to jump higher? Then pull venti or kazuha.” Stop acting like this is anything new in hoyos bag. It will become an issue if it’s a stat boost and then the real battle begins.
"It is not a PvP game. WHY ARE PEOPLE  COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS AMAZING MECHANIC??????? 

Hoyoverse players in general are the worst fandom

I did not see people crying about Acheron mechanic this much, only getting hype for her.

Do you want Castorice? Pull. Do you want to skip Castorice to pull for another one? Wait her rerun and get another character, Hoyoverse is not putting a gun in your head and saying ""pull for her now"""
Castorice will be the death of hsr
It doesnt really matter ive been playing since 1.0 and the beginning was the hardest i dont even die anymore in end game content. She is also not a must pull just because of this just pull for what you want
"""making the game pay to win"" isnt it already ? i mean its a gacha game lol

I don't like it, if it worked only in DU or something like ""select a global passive"" mechanic then i would like."
Me skipping her for Anaxa XD
People defending this shi 💀🙏
I personally think its not a big prob at all...
"If we make it as far as HSR 7.0, newcomers are gonna get a character that skips the entire story for them."
Okey the problem it is a global passive yes. But also what precedent are they putting here because after her other characters would need it as well.. One thing is she would revive her teammates while on the team similar to Bailu. Powercreep doesn't have anything here. It has been here for a long while we all know.. But having a global passive might turn hsr into a different game in my opinion couse every character would need or they wouldn't sell as well
Man who cares I want castorice!
Patch 4.0 : Solo MOC level 1 Arlan with Global Passive from other characters
Watch Phainon powercreep her somehow bc he's important in the story
"I dont really care, i like this. Theres free five stars going to be out on april 26 and other stuff, i really like this, and im more into hsr story anyway lol so i dont mind."
Uhhh does anybody use Preservation and Abundance units?
"Does everyone know that almost every boss in endgame content can basically one shot every team? Just me?

That's why Castorice's global passive wouldn't really be much of a difference. Not only is it lore accurate, but it's also convenient since it just looked like I got that one destruction or erudition blessing on DU (Just way worse, but still works)"
Just don’t pull for her then
I think that those who want castorice will get this buff as cherry on top. Those who don't want her can continue on their game as they did in the past 2 years
y'all are too emotional for a PvE game
"I see why people dislike it, but… I honestly have no problem with it"
To all the babies who think this game is too hard....just pull Castorice
"can revive doesnt mean u can 1 hit kill boss, which means its not too OP"
"Wth is this controversy...it's simple..if you don't want her, don't pull...if you want, then pull..bruh"
"I dont think this is too much of an op feature,however, it does set a bad precedent"
I don't really play hsr because how hard it always was because- you need well bulit characters to build characters and obtain new ones. But to get new ones you already need powerfull well built characters. And the powercreep is just... Ugh. It makes hsr unplayable for me but global passive? That is definetly too much and i'm afraid that hoyo might do that to zzz and genshin too😭 (but zzz devs at least listen to their community)
"My characters always die, I would love this. I love her and her design."
I'm mostly pulling for her bc of that awesome dragon ngl. Actually the first female I'm going out of my way to pull for (and then saving(?) for Anaxa and then Phainon)
"This wouldnt be a problem if
- She isnt a Limited character
- its Not a Global Passive but a Technique you can use
- Hoyo Potentially planning to Make New Characters with More Global Passive that basically Gatekeep End game content.

Being lore Accurate is such a bad excuse. If Being Faithful to Lore is so important, How come Emenators had to Spend 1 Point to use their godlike power. And WHY isnt Dan Heng use his Awaken dragon powers All the time?"
"Lol imagine in the future. Global res pen,global speed buffs,global crit buffs. Yeah we're cooked"
People complain everyday. Who cares 😂
I would prefer to have the option to turn her passive off if she's not in the team; I have no issue with it if she's in the team (it's similar to Bailu's revive) but I don't want this to be triggered of she's not on the team.
"with or without passive, I'm pulling for her regardless, I just like the character"
Second anniversary character btw and people are complaining 😭
"I don't really think 1 hp revive with no kind of protection can harm the balance that much.
 And Hoyoverse have made P2W since their name was mihoyo.
Is that really a thing to consider at now? After like 2 years of the game's service and over decade of P2W game systems they have done??"
hmmm... bailu is the key
"I dont like it because hoyo always finds a way to implement this type of stuff in bosses like ‘oh yall got castorice ? Now we gon make a boss that one shots your teammate once, good luck!"
If it were a mechanic to revive a character at 1 hp every burst...
for good reason
I don't really care i don't remember when last time any of my characters died in any endgame content.
I decided months ago that i pull for her so it couldn't be more irrelevant for me and i think there are a lot more that thinks similarly.
This is a Single player ffs
I dont think it will be a problem. It was probslly planned for niche mechanics and with all the backlash it will be like that either eay
"Why do people complain? This is great for the ones who could get her, if not that’s 100% their bad luck, not other people’s nor hoyo’s problem"
Broke as* people crying it's not our problem you can't pull for her because you pulled another character with you precious broken person resources
"I don't really play hsr, the last character I pulled was Mei, but if I had to give an opinion I'd say the revive is fine. It's a one time use anyway, so it won't impact most of endgame, and she's by far the DPS Queen. Ppl are tripping if they think that's powercreep."
"For me who's care!!
I definitely still in this game!!🔥
If don't u like just leave and I will tell to HOYO to make ur account will take it by HOYO Himself!!"
"Man afte scrolling through comment 

I am glad i left hoyo community bro wth are those 1 braincell people 🫩"
"No one is ""forcing"" anyone to pull for characters. You have free will, and your money is your responsibility."
We’re forgetting a character bailu who does the same but  just once tho
The people who are saying castorice is a must pull are overacting on purpose. She has a F2P team and options but she's still high restrictive and her passive isn't something that's going to be the reason you clear end game
"Would be nice if they removed the passive from the character and give the passive to every player that completes the story quest as a permanent buff of sorts, that would be nice."
"The passive is a problem only if it's the first of many more in the future. Right now it's not that big of a deal, people who can clear endgame will be able to clear it still. If they need to rely on her passive it's their skill issue. The lack of a decent 4 star f2p LC for Castorice is the real problem in my opinion. The passive is a problem only if they start releasing other passives in the future. The lack of LC options pisses me off more than the passive."
"I for one appreciate the ability to revive a fallen character mid battle, it has been lacking in this game for a long time and I’m stuck because I can’t defeat a boss."
"It's fine, I still have faith for my Aventurine build. 😂"
"If they are whining over that they should worry about the other stuff such as the HP pool in the end game contents, either way I don’t mind im to busy playing DU with my characters."
"Hilarious how she isn't even the first character with a global passive and she's getting hate.

(I swear if it was a male character like Mydei or Phainon, the hate will be close to non-existent with the reasoning of ""He is a king, he deserves this"" or ""it's Kebin, ofc he should get this privilege"""
this pve game so P2W must quit
Then don’t. Imagine not getting castorice as a challenge rather than something else. It’s not like we can all pvp. If we can PvP then that IS a problem. But this is only pve
It's powercreep because every character will have this. If not mihoyo won't be able to sell characters. There are 3 confirmed passives that will be released in couple of versions.
Who cares about lore? It's a precedent to make gacha games EVEN MORE PREDATORY
It wouldn't be as much of a problem if they didn't arbitrarily limit banners.
Bro im getting her and also she is the reason why tectone quit
what the fuck
"Well idk about her I will not pull her at all bc I don't need a passive so that my characters comes back zk when you lose in endgame or so is says use your brain in someway or something like that is just my opinion  

She looks cute yes and the character design is nice but I really don't like the passive I know she is death but still 

Fail in battle and come stronger back so I see that but ppl have different opinions"
Power creep of doom
"The ""even when she's not in the party"" definitely should be fixed but the revive is great since unlike Genshin you can't use any of the items sitting in your bag for healing or reviving IN battle. So having more characters with that passive is great, it just needs to be balanced so it's active when their in the party"
But didnt they say she defies death something like that. Thats why they put that passive on her
HI3 Player: Heh! First time?
Don't worry guys Artoria (Fate Collab character) will also have global passive. Since she will most likely to never come back due to license issues this will be only chance to get her.
"They are starting to shaft the f2p players,
this is a big L for hsr.

Give them 1 star review and boycut buying stuff in their games, dont let them get away with this!

Im saying this as a big spender who dosnt get hit by this, but they are ruining the experiance for those who dont!"
"It's been done before, hoyo create a problem, solved by pulling limited character
Before: Skill point issue (D. Dan Heng) = Sparkle
Now: 1 hit by boss = Castorice"
"Cry about it?
Does the game have a secret pvp mechanic or something?
Why do you all care about powrcreep so muc. Only whales will go to endgame with the best characters anyway."
"I mean you just need to pull her once, not get any eidolon or build her. Yes is is op and i don't like it but you just need her once and all your team are buffed, they are mad for no reason. Each new character is a money grab attempt, that's why every character is better with more eidolon and with their weapon."
Bailu can revive too
The passive is frankly not all that cuz ur character would still count as dead and thus u would miss out on 1 of the 3 stars in endgame. However the problem comes when later down the line they release incredibly broken global passives like giving your entire account crit rate/dmg
This doesnt seem like a big issue if the passive only works if she is on the team😂 but merely just her existing in your unlocked databank? That is way too strong
"global passive on a character is the dumbest thing hoyo could implement.... why it is bound on a character, they just could give it to all, who clear MoC, or an Event or something else.... but with that situation... RIP HSR it was great with you"
i like her
just dont die
honestly i get what they are saying because that mechanic is insane ist really dumb that it still activates when she isnt present im just gonna get her for that passive and yes ik i dont have to i just want the actually clear the moc for once ;-; hope they dont make future global passives like this
Westerns always complaint... What your expect this game free of course you need pay to win mechanics for money
"its fine, if your character die in the first place, revive wont do anything, your character will still die"
"If they removed her ability, i would be twenty times for death from all the events. Good thing she coming, as f2p having her will be worth especially in DV higher level & main storyline."
Bye bye game. I swear if no one quit’s the game than your all Hippocrates and two faced lier’s
The way i see it is they can add global passives i like the idea but make it anniversary character exclusive
"When I first saw the leaks I was one of the people that defended Hoyo and said that they whould never do something so stupid as to add a global passive making a character a must pull

I whould like to apologize because infact they where that stupid and I was even more stupid to think they whould remove it when it went untouched till v4 I am sorry I was stupid"
I dropped the game for a while but bailu does the same thing no?
Global passive powercreep in the future 🥰
On the one hand I approve of other characters getting a revive mechanic which for the longest time was exclusive to bailu. But on the other hand I don't like castorice having it as she isn't a healer
I don't even think my team will need this passive since my team rarely died
"Must have?
Op?
It's literally one of the worst possible global passives of all time 
If one of your characters get downed then you suck and she won't save you"
"i honestly don’t really care since i NEVER planned on pulling for her, but she’s DEATH. her REVIVING? makes no sense"
"I mean, do you really die in this game? It’s actually not that big of a deal. And don’t hit me with ""what about future GP for other characters"". We wait and see. If the game isn’t for you - don’t play it. We eatin good with HSR 😊"
This is like Gen 1 into Gen 2 characters in PGR... But it worked out great for Kuro meanwhile I don't see any positive thing about this for the future of HSR
When I think about this passive it’s not that OP to me
"I don't see the problem 😅
My team never die, the only problem is never can deal damage enough before cycle limit 😅"
I think Acheron is still more pay to win lol. Havent battled roaming enemies since i got her
I just want castorice for the cool asf dragon.
"There's a concentrated amount of people that think too much about the global passive, even though they have no basis to think anything from what they think is in hoyo plans to bring. If all these people really cared about ""characters becoming must pull because of the global passives they might get, as the game would adjust the content accordingly"", they would've left the game after first few patches, because any new character even without global passives creates the quoted menace. Any extra strong character, like Acheron in her time, The Herta and Mydei are all so strong, that eventually all the content will rise to reflect their power. Het i see no one throwing tantrum and ""leaving"" HSR. 
Global passives will do no difference. If they make a character must pull, well, people will pull. Otherwise, they will cry here like they already cried before saying how they cannot close content without a character forwards whom the content was targeted."
Don't apologize to the sociopaths. They wrong.
"Finally, some worth spending my money"
I don't think this is going to cause an issue.... I mean it's a broken passive but no one is forced to pull her so...... And also she only does it one time per battle it's not like it's infinite.... I think everyone  just needs to pull the characters you like and enjoy the game.  And there's one thing I realized playing both genshin and star rail  These communities always seem to find something to bitch about or complain about. And no I'm not talking about the obvious issues with each game or the company major I'm talking about characters in particular or the art.
"I still find it ridiculous it works while she is outside the team. Either way, I don't want her and my teams don't die. Sounds like a 0 cycler's dream unit."
Don't worry guys she will be nerfed after 3 months.
"If it was when she's on field only, then fine, like this it's really bad"
"Create lore 

Proceed to let Gaslight themselves thinking ""Nah bro it's Her power""

Make everyone pull for her 

Proceed to milk everyone of their hard-earned money

CLASSIC HOYO BS."
Meanwhile the ZZZ players are enjoying the 24/7 bakery.
I hate that since i don't play or pull any female charaters
"Yeah, big whoop. It's always whine and whine but you literally don't need this passive if you build your teams right. Just sounds like a skill/wallet issue to me."
She is not a must pull: just a REALLY good pull if your team is dying even with your sustain something is wrong with your team or you just got unlucky.
45 post after castorice drip a castorice video is out finally
To all those that are complaining just don't pull her.
Honestly if youre dying in endgame content that isnt the hardest DU then thats actually embarrassing.
"The global passive is a neat idea on paper, but in practice, it can cause some controversies."
"I think its passive is interesting. When even Nikador ""Titan of Strife"" go to Final form, he had the ultimate move with 1 Throw Spear 1 whole team die😅"
I'm OK with it until there is no PvP
gacha game. p2w? oh no.
Crying about powercreeps and saying Pay to win in a single player pve game is dumb to me
"Still better than 7DS:Grand Cross meta powercreeps (I play it like, 5 years and still going)... I still don't see it how this would destroy the game eventhough everyone disagree with global passive already explain few things:

1.) For those who says powercreep and such, you're only powercreeping yourself. It's not even PvP-based competition, so why? Everyone's still good actually... 

2.) For those who feel likes Castorice forcing you to pull her, just... don't pull her so she doesn't destroy your gameplay?

3.) I think Amphoreus characters are already accurate lore since they're humans who went ""demigods"", so they can grant/use supernatural powers? (nah, what am I saying with this one... )

4.) Why not decide it on some endgame content creators to see if it's really OP or not like what people said? Why decided it bad when all we see her is from beta leaks? 

5.) Basically, every single games wrung out our wallets... Playing P2W on game is like, online casino where you gamble your money. Maybe spend your money only on guaranteed items like costumes or such. No one forces you to gamble. These characters will surely have a rerun, but if only you had patience enough. My suggestions: pull what you need, not what you want

Basically, that's all of my problems with people complaining about this patch. I'm just venting out with these unending complaints, even on other Hoyo games..."
Ppl think Hoyo will release more global passives after watching them never release another DoT unit 😂
Don't care about it at all... pull or not.... doesn't bother me.
"don't be surprised if some super fast boss like Hoolay in the future has x3 dmg and the only way to finish late game content perfectly is to have x amount of global speed and dmg buff from y characters. Spend that extra astrogem to get some character you don't like with global x, ya whales"
"who cares, she is a WAIFU ! it would be worse if this hability was on a dick chara"
"The HSR community is cooked, divided and full of hatred for the company they once cheered ""Genshin could never"".  What a community to be in."
Good in other end games but not MOC
"Bro, even in genshin you need Qiqi or Barbara to stay in the team to do that, n that's also locked behind their last cons. Bruh what is this?"
This game more updates every single free to play player cannot play anymore
"It's a dangerous concept because we know later they will do the same with things like crit rate, crit damage, hp and energy regen"
"I personally dont give af, let hoyo experiment with something new. I cant see any universe where these global passives are so broken that your account is bricked without it. If that happens then you can complain because right now we don’t know what they are planning to do. Ive skipped a lot of characters that people say is a must or have and guess what I have always cleared MOC without failing. I could even do with some older dps characters if I really wanted to. Older units aren’t as weak as some people make it out to be. A lot of older units just need the right weakness to clear, they can’t brute force anymore. This is why I hate talking about powercreep because it doesn’t exist. What truly exist is HP inflation though, which makes it feel like powercreep."
I'm still gonna pull of her and her FREAKING DRAGON!!! I ain't missing the opportunity to have a dragon on my team
"I would say simply not let the passive be active while shes not on the team and that's all, the rest is fine, like unless you have a healer or a character that some how autorgenes I don't see it as that op since you come back with 1 HP like you will die in one hit. 

And also it only does it 1 time per battle so it can help lower players, more casual ones, or that don't have great builds and don't have the time to farm for better ones. 

And like, what do they mean with her being pay to win, like yeah she's a powerful character but other characters are also powerful and it's not like only with her you can kill x enemies to progress the game or something like it. 

Tldr, stop complaining people just enjoy the game, it's not the end of the world just relax, it's just a game for everyone to enjoy at the end of the day. Just change her passive so she cannot use it while she's not in the team and that's all. If you complain about her then just don't pull and that's all"
Seems cool but kinda weird if her passive works if she’s not even in the team. Also why only 1hp? You would have to have a healer included then and hope you can heal the character before they get taken out again
"I mean if your dying anyways, then I don’t your current team is good enough lol. 
The issue isn’t about her abilities but rather potential problem where many characters will have global passives in the future.
However this won’t be an issue if only Castorice has a global passives. Since the worry is that future characters will have global passives.
So we can only hope Hoyo makes sure to never make another global passive again."
I guess MiHoyo is just milking the players as much as possible. Genshin and HSR alike
Love seeing incels crying about it
"its such a stupid idea. i dont want castorice, i dont even really like her that much but with the global passive it would be just stupid of me not to get her even though i want to get the other amphoreus characters"
Global passive is crazy 😅
"Me having 60 pity and having 182 pulls ready
🗿👍"
Lore accurate my ass
"Bruh its not that deep, ppl that can beat moc will still be beating moc and ppl who cant beat moc will still not beat moc, if you can beat moc having a revive will do jack shit and if you cant beat moc getting revived will just make you watch your character die again"
I guess you could have fun with her till she is relevant for 42 days till next character powercreeps her and you go for that one giving similar reasons
"Well, like I said I love dragons. They're my favourite fantastical creatures and I'm a casual player. I do understand the problem of her global passive though. Benching her for another character will be inevitable. I'm pretty sure the characters of this patch will be powercreep probably in the next two adventures. I ain't wasting my anger on a game I'm playing casually"
​ @Riyozsu  I don't know about you but hyacine and cipher are definitely not gonna powercreep castorice
@hauntinqghost right
"Dragon enjoyer :D
Im gonna pull for the same reason"
 @aichacamara5733  basically what I wanted to say
"Blatant bait character, dev self insert is sad"
​@hauntinqghost Phainon or Saber will be
The devs just had to give that excuse so all the Hoyoshills can defend it online
​ @Gaze-fu4bv And y'all are just sociopathic Karens who will find every reason to hate hate hate hate over 1 thing that isn't bad.
Yeah then what's stopping them to give emanators global passives as well? Esp since all of the emanators are godly in their own right? How about jade and aventurine who both have cornerstones? They're just glazing castorice. No more reasons needed.
Keep crying about a feature in this non PvP game 😂
"Remember the HP inflation? Yes, this is the compensation for that. Shut."
"Idc, i mean the game is pay to win anyway lmao"
"just making it easier doesn't mean that without castorice you can't complete end game content, if you haven't been able to 3star moc so far it doesn't mean that if you have castorice you can immediately 3star moc😂"
"I have no problem with her having this ability 
However there's two issues with it 
First I really wish that this ability would only work IF she is on your team. 
Second there's a chance that future characters will get ridiculous global passives like this one. Heck I'm putting all my cards that Phainon will defo get a global passive.
PS: I don't hate Castorice btw. In fact i like her character."
Poor bailu...
"This is a darn shame, I really liked Castorice. If I was still playing the game, I wouldn't pull for her because of the global passive. It sets such a hugely damaging precedence for future content that I'm not willing to support."
"its once per battle.... ONCE LITERALLY ONCE, and you still need to heal them from 1 to some

Did people also forget that they are buffing Old characters to keep up with harder content, its like a good thing comes in at one ear and out the other, but here comes one small thing that helps players who has that character and they rant like the game will explode"
"Getting revive just simply exist in your account. That's the problem

What next, hoyo? Gonna make character that can make you use 5 character per team instead of 4 like always.

Luckily i left the game on rappa banner"
"Heard that we'll get around two to three more of characters with global passive

It'd be funny if one of them have the ability to add levels to your talent skills 😅"
"It'd still be perfectly fine and lore accurate if it only affected the ones in her actual party. It being global, while also lore accurate, is stupidly broken in a gameplay sense."
"Slowly they will implement other future character that could do damage after all allies taking one turn even if not in the current party. Hoyo could implements DU Hysilen buff in her actual kit making the enemies taking whatever debuffs she gives to enemies. Yeah not so fun right when it does happen to those who proclaimed to be ""Idc player. play who you want. I don't get why ppl hate Castorice"" now you're obligated to pull for X character in the future lol."
"Nah It's ok for now we're almost guaranteed to get her 
If they'll release another after this patch we might have a problem"
Power creep is crazy
"Yeah no i don't want to ruin my account, def skip"
They are turning simulated universe buffs into characters 😂
at least they could change it so it only works when shes in the team but NOOOOO they want money ig
"Nah i'm good with that, no problem. Those are yapping is a meta slaves (western ofc) since i just playing for fun not so competitive i'm okay with that"
"As a pure f2p, I could care less if she's op or not I just like her and will pull her will all the jade I grind and save"
"Nah, fam. I'm pulling her even if that feature isn't there. 😂"
everyone crying On Single Player Game
"No bro, she isnt a must have. If anything abt her is a must have, its her dmg. Her passive is completely useless unless ur just shit at the game"
I don't even know which side I should be on now.....
"To the global defenders, when we get a male character who gives a 10% Crit Rate global passive, I hope y'all keep this same energy."
if it's about lore what about blade?
"Actually, if you take how often the enemies can hit in endgame, to revive with 1 HP doesn't make much difference if you do not have available interrupt healing. Most of the time, it's just making enemies do one additional move to take the character down for good. I know this all too well with Bailu during my early days with HSR. So what's so broken with it? I'm gonna make my Acheron E2 instead of getting Castorice this upcoming patch. If I still have resources left after upgrading Acheron, I'll go for Fugue... lol. 

3.x DPS so far, I only have Therta and she's pretty much enough for the rest of 3.x as a damage dealer. The rest of the 3.x DPSes, I'll take my time to decide, not in a hurry. If anything, I have to say 3.x gave me a pleasant surprise by having Tribbie and current shine on Erudition to make my Argenti useful again after being benched for the longest time."
It's probably just for MOC when Casrorice is on your second team. It would be weird if suddenly you get this ability just because you got Casrorice
"""Lore accurate""... if things were lore accurate, Acheron's ult would Kaveh enemys from the game."
"its not good for future environment, because the threat of new broken global passive. 

But, i dont care, i still enjoy the game, i still pull for castorice even without that passive, and i dont pull for other unit i dont want even they have broken global passive. 

Its still good game for gacha standard, and i think free ruan mei/future limited, exchange limited, selectable 50:50, and buff old unit is good."
"Js get her, rather complain like genshin player,😅"
Anyone supporting it can go argue with a wall. You have the same IQ as the bricks anyway. There are three more GP characters coming. One increasing Attack and another for the Crits. That is hideously over the line. Don’t excuse this by any means.
Nah they should've made her free if this was gonna be the case. At least make her temporarily free like Dr. Ratio
no one is forcing you to spend money her😭
"Yeah
They might make more unique passives and push the limit, I understand that 

But her being P2W or a must have is right and wrong at the same time.
P2W? U just need to get her E0.
Must have? Nah

Her global passive feels like lore accurate but if they make something like Passive Slot, which u have to select one passive and only that one can work, there will be no problems.

So people's concerns are valid but being P2W or Must have doesn't make sense to me
Its just what they might do in the future"
"The main issue I see is the combination of a global, always active passive once you get her and the fact she's a character you might be unable to get if you're F2P or have to pay real money to get.
You could nerf the passive to only trigger when she's actively in battle, at which point it would be a variation of Bailus Gourdful of Elixir which can revive 1 character and heal them partially ; Castorice could only revive but would rely on others to do the healing, in return she can revive several people, not just one.

The Global buff/passive itself would be fine if it wasn't linked to something you potentially had to use real money to buy. If they were to introduce some kind of tower/dungeon system where you have to beat a dungeon every week and in return you could choose a temp. buff for your battles, that'd be fine since you could do that even with F2P teams.
From what I've heard, Castorice won't be the only one with a global passive. 1-2 other characters in the near future are supposed to have something similar, and they will most likely all come out basically back to back - if that's true, any F2P player has to essentially gamble and choose which global passive they want, because being able to get all of the global passives might be very well impossible for them.

Another issue is powercreep. If we're already at the level where a character, even at level 1 and never being used is able to provide a significant power boost to any team, one has to wonder what's next on the agenda. There has to be a balance at some point where new characters don't come with unique, broken skills, or otherwise the original characters are essentially going to end up being useless."
Sorry i don't fking care. Its not like last moc stage give you 1 pull so.....
Shhhhhhhh
"My friend was going to pull for Castorice. When she heard about this passive, she changed her mind because she found this absolutely ridiculous."
The point isn’t that its a passive revive. The point is that it’s a global passive and since hoyo is doing it now who knows what future characters’ passive is gonna look like +50%damage/def for just polling it?
Ignore it and play the game
maybe stay neutral and just keep playing (but its getting harder to T_T)
"Yeh, just follow your heart and enjoy the game. If you want to pull for her then go for it no need to trouble yourself on this problem. Peace is what keeps things normal..."
 @kuro8115   it's being very clear that Hoyo just wants money nowadays but the fan base are weird af so yeah I am neutral but some things juts pisses me off
Well if the future global passive(GP) are like Cassie's like you'll now have chance for double drop on some trace material or you will now spend less credits on characters and synthesis if you get the character then it's not that bad it doesn't make character must pull but if a global passive making a team go from 6 cycle the moc to 3-4 cycle the moc then..... Yea just leave bcs then it becomes for most struggling people to must pull and it would be spice on wound that you don't like that character at all. I'm also same boat with you idk I'll only take side when I'll see some more future GPs
Btw I saw CN reviews and they don't give a fk about GP so yea forget any chance of GP getting removed in future
Play games that have more effort put into them than just marketing. Get away from Hoyo.
"​​​ @NelesYT some things like what? Anw just enjoy the game, if u like the game then play it, if u dont then dont play it, dont listen to those salty butthead"
"This, the only reason they dont care about the global passives is that the only character that has it right now is a OP female DPS that they were going to pull anyway, but when a character they dont like gets one broken global passive they will go feral"
"Male incels go defensive over fictional waifus even worse than women who simp for male charas, 100% true."
Finally my seele reach get 70% crit rate with that
"I would bro I would, since I would get all characters anyway"
I mean what's the harm? It's not like this game is competitive
 @Users_zero00  and still won't crit with ult.
 @Isomeria450  xcom ptsd
 @Users_zero00  please... don't...
"Nice, cant wait to get that"
Fine by be! I mean most meta teams need any damn male i dont own anyway... and cant beat moc entirely... So if the 0 cycle moc people are quiet then... fine by me~
​ @Sared1017  projecting at it's finnest
They won’t
 @AnbuAssasine  because of that bullshit most game modes will be unplayable since they will be must-to-have.
"Hey man just saying the kits for phainon, saber and archer already dropped and my oh my seems like there's no global passive?!?!? Surely hoyo must be doing something wrong then right?"
" @ElephantThePotato  nope, its worded exactly as “when you obtain castorice” you obtain the global buff."
"personally i have no issue with castorice's passive. as someone who is pulling for cas myself, i see the passive as pretty much useless. unless you're a newer player, you shouldn't even be dying in combat so often, thus her passive will rarely even be used at all.

the only issue with this implementation is the PRECEDENT it brings in potentially releasing game breaking passives in the future, which is an issue for a lot of the player base as it could lead to future characters being p2w.

though i honestly don't have an issue with this either. i don't really care if they're gonna add more global buffs. i don't care if they release anything game breaking. i'm still pulling for cas and would definitely pull for phainon. i'll still be playing the game even if it leans towards a more p2w future. i love the game and i've invested a lot in it to suddenly just boycott. people who are boycotting and complaining have to realise that there are people who won't care and will support whatever hoyo does and to me that's okay, like how it's also okay to hate what the game and company has and will become."
"Still fine if allies at 1 hp don't get immunity and if the effect only works once per battle, it's only useful for 0 cyclers and skill issue players.

The real problem is that it works even if she isn't in the team and if future characters will also get global passives."
"Global Passives aren't a problem ONLY IF





a. Is ""unique"", let's say, to anniversary characters, or 
b. Provides a niche buff that is CONDITIONALLY useful.

Castorice's global passive itself is mid as hell, only really useful to those zero-cyclers and for ""tanking"" a boss' special move, once. The former of which, isn't really that special, just a small QoL to sustainless comps, granting them an extra turn, which could alleviate some 0-cycle clears failing, and the latter, being somewhat a skill issue. If you let the boss do their special move, you're doing something wrong. There is always, if not, most of the time, a proper mechanic you have to deal with in order to NOT get nuked by the boss, and if the boss has no special move, you are NOT dying if you have a PROPER sustain, ok? If you die to overworld mobs, I hate to break it to you, but that's a skill issue. If it's to bosses, what I said above will apply. Properly read and use the boss mechanic to your advantage.

While yes, it's quite a dangerous precedent to the future characters, do note that saying flat out ""omg castorice has a global passive now everyone else js gonna get them"" is a big slippery slope fallacy, and has no current proofs supporting it. This is also why a exists: if it's unique, there wouldn't be the problem of having to pull everyone for their Global Passive.

I see jokes about ""ok 5.0 guys everyone has a global passive"" or whatever, and while they are somewhat funny, it's a big slipperly slope to say that they'd go and add this, when there aren't any proofs that support it. 

And no, powercreep is not a supporting proof for the Global Passive. Powercreep is a phenomenon that affects almost all games, and is not a supporting proof because of it's definition.

Let's start with that. The formal definition of powercreep is ""increase the power of a relatively new unit over old units, in order to make the old unit feel less relevant"". NO older unit will feel ""less relevant"" with the addition of this passive. Bailu? Now you have TWO revives instead of one. Fu Xuan E2? Same thing, TWO revives instead of one."
This is why I saved up for her😁
Who support this  only dum people
"""a must have character""

Because of its passive?? Do they always die on endgame content??

I smell skill issue"
I think I'm getting acherons e6
I feel like if it's only in overworld content it's fine and it dosent affect higher tier and game content
C6 barbara has a revive but she's generally not top tier lol
HSR and genshin fandom are the worse.
"Where were these guys when they forced us to pull Firefly, Ruan Mei and even Madam Herta? 
Many of us skipped/lost 50-50. They made us regret not getting these characters."
i just wish it was only when she was on ur team
"well guess what, hyacine is rumored to have a global passive, and she has an ability locked behind her LC. keep giving them your money and they'll keep screwing you over like this."
"I find it so hilarious that people seem to forget that HSR is a gacha game 😹 Like it or not, stuff like this is pretty normal in gacha, especially for an anniversary character. But I guess that's one of the downsides of trying to conceal it as a regular game like Hoyo does. 

I think if people got over the utterly lame and boring superbreak mechanic (which is when I quit), they can also get over this. People just like to complain. Especially the f2p and husbando enjoyers xD"
"I actually like it and welcome it. I understand the frustration behind it, but this doesn’t bother me at all and again I like it. It’s just a game anyways and shouldn’t be taken that seriously. Y’all can argue with me and point out whatever u want, but again it’s just a game and u can find something else that will satisfy u more"
This passive must work ONLY when Cas is in the team. If it works outside the team - is ia awful and predatory.
Can't wait for the character who is functionally useless in battle but has a global passive that buffs ATK by 3000
"I just hope these global passives don’t become too impactful cuz wdym we could have a global passive where CD or CR is increased 😭
I hope they limit these to specific characters or else we be walking around with a character that clears hoolay and nikador for you without having to be in the team 🌚🫶"
Blade : why u make me suffer???!!!!
Must i remind you that bilu does the same thing
"And then when more and more 3.X and 4.X characters come out with global passives....
Then at 5.X and 6.X we can get them for free with the new currencies if assuming they give out one every anniversary (and more cuz they mentioned they will give another one for free this year)

It's just average Gacha game, Hsr is a Gacha game, they want money, and they already been so generous"
How does it work when she is not in the team?
What do you mean the game is designed to be pay to win
Imagine innovating not in gameplay but in gacha.
"""It's lore accurate"" then why Trailblazer is not as strong as the cutscene suggest, and why a literal black hole, blade that can trap soul, Orbital cannon, and etc barely do anything to literally anyone.









Lore accurate arguments can be a double edged swords, that's why i mostly use them for jokes and HSR balance is always a jokes."
"Now imagine this revival turns into crit damage boost or rate or speed boost 
Every character should be obtained then or your teams that u built will be useless in the next patch that's a problem the game was fun because it allows u to finish content with what u have and be creative not what u buy"
"Hear me out
NORMAL HSR players think that no endgame content is hard"
Simple don't pull or don't play the game 😂😂😂
"The problem isn't even the passive, reviving is kind of useless if we have a descending sustain, the problem is that this leaves room for today to do the same thing to future characters"
"People keep saying that this will ruin hsr. Well first of all this is bs because it's not like this is a multiplayer or a pvp game. I don't personally see a problem with it. It my be kind of op but keep in mind that the characters will be on 1 hp meaning that in most situations they would probably be dead either way on the next turn. And if not, they would eventually die from the lack of hp. I understand people's concerns, but come on, power creep is something that couldn't be escaped either way. In games like this, it's inevitable. Besides, f2p does not mean all 4 stars and 4 star weapons. I'm a free to play and i barely play on my account but for example i can clear moc up to stage 11. Hsr devs are being generous enough"
Not as op as you still need to be healed or you can say bye bye to your characters that castorice revived
"Bro, why are people complaining about it being too broken? I haven’t killed my characters a single time this update and I’m F2P"
"I'll continue to play the game, but I for sure will never pay a single penny on it ever again"
i mean it's fair cuz of the lore plus if u rlly want her then try to get her
Saying this is fair because it's justified by the lore is like saying HSR is entitled to your money because a gacha player is supposed to be spending to support a gacha game
"I’ve been talking about this on Reddit with the others, and someone had the idea that, perhaps, it’s just a QoL feature specific to a few characters that eventually gets dropped in favour of something else. 

Kind of like how Acheron, Feixiao (and maybe FF?) have a QoL for pretty much insta-killing mobs. It’s amazing but ultimately not the thing that will determine the future of your account.
(Edit: and remember, back when Acheron was the first and only one to do this, people were also angry about the QoL powercreep and how they have to pull Acheron despite not liking her, just to make farming mobs easier. I myself was inclined to pull her but then Feixiao came along, who I was gonna pull anyway, and who can take care of mobs in a similar fashion.)

I’m really hoping that to be the case here too, that this batch of characters have the special 5 stars with niche but kinda useful global passives to make them more unique and tempting, and that’s that. 

Because in itself Castorice’s passive is… okay. It needs a sustain to work well, and in case a sustain is on the team most people probably aren’t dying anyways (and if they do because they struggle with sustain, chances are the revive won’t help them unless they’re like one hit away from winning). Without sustain it only applies to sustainless runs, which is usually done by more skilled players with better built characters anyway - it can be useful there to combat bad RNG ONCE, but only once, cutting down the attempts from idk, 80 to 50. 

Overall my opinion is that Castorice’s passive isn’t all that great in practice. It’s a cool QoL but there are few times when it will actually impact your performance in a significant amount (like, as said, when you’re one hit away from winning when your DPS gets knocked down). If all passives are similar instead of being just flat out universal stat boosts, then I think this could be something unique and fun. 

The problem comes if they DO start producing characters that just boost stats. 
For now I’ll choose to try and be positive, enjoy the game and it’s new characters, get back into the story, and hope Hoyo handles global passives in a good way rather than going the pure greed route."
I like how most comments here make it sound like there characters ALWAYS die in battles come on lets be honest ppl either have lingsha fu xuan luocha adventurine in the team at this point in game
I think it works with her law
"It wouldn't be much of a deal if she was just an OP character that will stay in meta for long like how Furina is a huge support and can also walk over the water infinitely, but the fact she is most likely going to get powercrepted in two or three patches is the major issue. When Phainon, Cyrene or even March's new form come out, she will no longer be AS good, just like what happened with Acheron and Firefly"
"Slippery slope fallacy, technically this global passive isn’t that egregious, but what about for future characters?  It could lead to permanent stat bonuses for all characters on an account, essentially forcing players to pull for a character they do not want if they want to clear most endgame, especially with older characters. This is bad, the power creep is completely off the rails in Star Rail. Instead of power creeping characters Hoyo is power creeping entire accounts with this one in the not too distant future."
" @GrimmReapgi  the issue has never been its power, it is the precedent it sets

1 time revive at 1hp is nowhere near op anyone complaining about that is stupid

Where it does matter is that castorice sets a precedent for hoyoverse to add more busted shit like stat and talent level ups in global passives on limited time characters. Where the way to acquire them is through a factual gambling system.

HSR past the early updates has never had the players have an issue with ""dying"".


The global passive is a anti consumer practice that hoyo is gping to be using to squeeze more money out of characters. After all whats more valuable than a character that does stuff on the bench?

If hoyo really wants to put in global passives for the ""quality of life"" or ""health of the game"" then they can easily put it on the MC they have various different forms to do that. But they dont they will put the passives on a select few units

If you want an example of this thing happening just look at how fast hoyoverse implented new characters on par with acherons damage only a couple of patches after her release"
"there is 3 more ready before 3.x finish. Speed up, crit rate and damage up, talent level up. These are gonna release in 3.x if Castorice doesn't cause problem within community."
" @extrastuffboxofaksakl1k354  Source? 
I'm looking at leaks / leakers all the time, but haven't seen anyone say anything of the sort. 
I'd like to check the credibility of whoever leaked it before I believe it."
"​ @extrastuffboxofaksakl1k354 yeah, I've seen that leaks too but if that leak will be changed than I'm relieved since I'm not sure will have enough luck and jade for all of em"
Anyway for me Acheron insta kill better since it was faster (even though it drain more tp but that doesn't really matter unless you're is su/du hard mode)
"@ Ugh where did my reply go? D: Yt is at it again. Anyway, source please!"
"There is no way Hoyo is stopping this trend at one unit, do not trust this company"
" @user89389  so you're having same problem with me too, YouTube also often doesn't let me send a reply, anyways for the leaks I know about the upcoming GP were from uncle titanoboa but it's different from what they've said (it's Atk, SPD+max hp, and trace (I forgot if it was talent/skill of memosprite and basic attack) evel up"
"@ Yes and it's so annoying! It's also removing the person who I'm @-ing. I can see it while I make the reply, then I send and poof - it's gone. And so is the comment. So buggy. Ugh. 

Thanks! I like to check the track record of the leakers, before I choose to believe it. There are some leakers out there who seem to be part of the Engimata and just straight up making things up, lol. 

Being cautious doesn't hurt but atm I don't feel like doomposting whatever isn't confirmed."
" @user89389  I guess yorue right, it removed your @ right now 😭"
"Completely agree with all of this. Castorice's global passive isn't that great, but it's not her global passive everyone's worrying about. It's future global passives which could defeat the purpose of HSR being a turn based strategy game."
"Bro this is the best amount of logic and reason I've seen in these comments. Holy shit ❤

Finally a person who isn't a sociopathic Karen acting like the Russian government."
"Well your comment makes sense, but sadly those salty people wont hear u, just enjoy the game"
"​ @Queen_Myrrh  the thing is, it actually helps people who really struggle St end game content...

I mean i cant Max clear any of the 3 endgame modes due to lack of decent relics after farming like crazy and everytbing being e0 except the standards...

These global passives literally just make my existing cast stronger if i decide to get them and give me a better shot at content...

With these passives they can somewhat counter how weak past characters have become yet these passives are tied to the characters..."
" @AnbuAssasine  If they didn't inflate the hp I bet you'd be fine without the global passive, but because they wanna make money I guess they have to make harder content so everyone will spend money on their new top tier characters to clear more content.
I use to be able to clear end game content till the hp inflation. Now I can't cause I refuse to pull for the new trash they're putting out."
IT IS okay Just please only If she IS in the Team.
"Wdym, barbara c6, and qiqi c6 both have a revive in their cons."
"Lmao ""lore accurate"" is so most stupid thing to say from those balls lickers, i mean when you want lore accurate just gave us buff went we finish the story no need to pull for the in game passive that is lore accurate."
The entire thing is it's 1hp and it's usually gonna happen on enemy turns or your healers turn is blocked by enemies meaning it's not that good honestly it would suck in endgame cuz pretty much everything is multi target aswell (and if anyone calls me coping or a shill I'm not trust ne I thought about this for a bit)
She is a unique character and she must have unique talents
Just no. I've said it before. I'm not putting up with it. No thanks
X normal day😅
"lore accurate doesnt even matter here when blade is literally immortal but can die.

this is a problem for the future, with what other bs global passives they can get away with.
people shouldn't spend on castorice's banner to really let hoyo know we hate this but ccs will be ccs and people will spend because they dont care about the game's future. really sad"
"hoyo twitter is so fuckin funny😂😂 I know that it's browkn but y'all don't need to complain abt her passive since it's apart of lore, it ain't powercreep💀💀 (ok it might be but CASTORICE IS SO FUCKING BEAUTIFUL😭😭)"
"As a long time variety gacha player, global stats,effects and skills are not new, the only difference is in most games such stuff can be accessed by players in some kind of f2p way that only requires grinding, quests, achievements etc.

HSR on the otherhand is selling such thing through a character, this greed is equivalent to Genshin's double new character banner of Mavuika/Citlali at the same time, actually much worse as if this global passive BS succeeds, future HSR characters will have more crazier global passives that F2P's would curse on why such thing exists as they cannot get everything, meaning not having such characters is already a gap vs accounts that have said character.

Now the excuse is, well it's a single player turn based gacha game why bother about accounts, well I won't bother debunking such excuses any further as such players are probably the same ones that supports stuff like the Mavuika + Citlali banners. Explaining things to such people are pointless"
It’s not a problem and not a game breaking ability. Quit the game & stop playing if you think that. Literally can’t have any fun in this game
"I saw her design I pull idk if she broken or not. I been saving for her since I saw the design 😂😂. 

People honestly that has been playing long can just pull who ever and clear all the content idk what’s so hard about that?. 👀

That said the game is indeed unbalance which I agree and it’s HSR tactic but overall does it effect me and enjoyment level? No? I don’t need 0 cycles a game that I play for fun and it’s not competition. Will I still post feedback on how the game is unbalanced OF course!. But will I make drama out of it ? NO."
"I don't get what y'all even consider pay2win. Like if they shouldn't get perks like this if they pay, what are they even winning then? And it's not anyone's fault but yours, you can definitely get her free2play. Her leaks were all over the place and you can totally save up this patch."
Or maybe don’t pull for her if you don’t want to
Already un-installed. I'm done with the predatory tactics and max greed.
"What do i think? It's a dogshit really, it's not Casto's fault nor her op kit and revive passive and obv not her look (she is cute and beautiful)

But the very global passive existence itself causes a bad premise for future game development. There might be another char with another global passhit in the future with this one exist"
Its lore accurate tho
We just need more res options
Don't forget how many pulls we get in 3.2
"It's not that OP, most oldbie casual player don't care about this passive because their team rarely die"
True whoever is crying are just the ones u dont have pulls to pull her and if they really release more characters with global passive I will pull them too lol
 @BibekDas-yy7mg  dumb as hell. This is the equivalent of a whale telling f2p players they suck because their characters aren’t e6 s5 and able to 0 cycle MoC
What's the lore of next 3 global passive characters?
"As I play more for building the characters and watching their animations, i actually like the idea of buffs that would not require a character on the team. I would have to pull a character I possibly don't like, bummer, but at least I wouldn't have see them - ex. for me it would be preferable if Robin had some of her kit in a form of global passive so that I wouldn't lose that much by not having her on my team, since I deslike pretty much everything about her, especially the 4-chords pop song (I want to enjoy the audible aspect of the game when i play)"
This Is not a problem lol😂
"I'm sure they are not gonna do this willy-nilly. Castorice giving this ability is fitting, but for others it's not as clear yet. I'm sure they are not gonna tag this onto characters without giving an actual lore reason for it."
"Frankly, the only problem is that it's global... as a feature, it's not broken. They could just have made it unable to be activated in end game mods"
It's whatever on its own. It makes me wonder if later on could we stack multiple off team passives?
Even though you only get 1hp it still feels like this will make the game too easy and unfair to people who don’t have her. If we complain enough would it be possible for them to make it optional?
"Honestly, since having Aventurine my team rarely dies 😂"
"If they make endgame harder so that it’s only possible with the new op character ms, that’s where the problem really starts to get on my nerves, others I’m completely fine with this"
">newfriends complain about meta and must-pulls
LOL. LMAO.
Welcome to Gacha Gaming 101."
"“Forcing them to pull”
No one is forcing you to pull?? 💀💀"
Imagine phainon gives global 15% crit rate buff 💀
I bet people will get over it after Castorice is released just like every patch so far.
"Thank god I quit hoyo games, they have been getting desperate and it’s showing, Star Rail is probably the most expensive to play, way too many characters, power creep is out of control, blatantly ignoring play styles to milk meta slaves at the expense of casual players, and now the castorice global revive, that just forces players to either pull or bust, and would mean the future for gacha will get worse, and much more predatory."
"Even if I don’t really care about “power creep”things, but this passive is just weird, and what about the future characters? There is the first global passive and it will come the second, third and so on. I can accept it if it work only when Cas is in that team. Now the dev is really playing with players patience😂"
"I personally think the hate is incredibly overblown.  Castorice's passive is incrediblely niche in its application, as if you are in a situation where a character is dying once, you're already in state that proves that you aren't fit for whatever content you're in.  It might be a safety net for sloppy play, but provides no increase in actual combat strength.

If anything, this is the logical progression of HSR's power scaling.  It is a gatcha game, and characters do need to be doing something new to remain profitable.  And with how vastly limited the combat system is in HSR, this is a pretty decent direction to take."
How tf she is must pull? We have great sustains like Aventurine Lingsha that almost 100% prevent us from death. Dying in MoC rn is either your build or skill issues.
"Is it just me who finds the people who are complaining stupid? ITS 1HP?! Reminder 1HP WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH 1HP? it so stupid and people are acting like it is the end of the world and you HAVE to pull her, no you dont because trust me new gens the next 2 patchs shell be powercreeped i mean look at sparkle"
I don't care. She looks cool
"I kinda hope I could toggle this global passive off. I want castorice, but I want to relive the frustration I felt at prenerf deer."
"If this was going to be a one off thing, they should have given the player base a free copy like they did with Dr ratio. Hell, they’re giving either luocha or Ruan Mei for free and adding characters to the standard banner so we can pick them for our yearly reset. But if this global passive is going to continue onward, then damn. Already we have 2 new five stars every patch and now they’re adding these busted units as well. 5 stars don’t even feel special anymore."
"This, this is literally how people should view her passive just a safety net, and literally nothing else"
"Precisely, also doesnt it only work if your character is healed in the next turn?"
"@fwuffcat  From every report I've seen, yes.  And only once per battle, and only if the character is healed before their next turn.  It sounds nice at a glance, but it's use case is so restrictive I can't imagine it really being good for much, especially outside of teams that use Castorice and have their HP constantly on the low end."
"Okay but this is a problem cause zzz and genshin power creep problem is non existent so they know how to do it but they just choose not to. And you are missing the point of what it means for the future and this could eventually be another ruan mei situation where in time it will become basically essential cause of how they decided to shift the meta. And I'm sorry global passives is not a good direction to take cause we now know it's gonna open the floor gates how long till spd, atk, crit, auto healing passives? It's just gonna make everything pointless at this point the path system is already terrible cause they just threw that out the window so I just need to understand why defend such a bad implementation?"
" @Im_Motivated-Ayato  yes, but it sets the precedent for new global passives"
" @teddyisaliar271  I mean, with the way hsr is going with powercreep already I can’t say I’m not worried about what global passive means for the future of meta

Because what is going to be so hard to fight that I need a revive? I stand by my point, this particular global passive probably isn’t going to be the make or break of a person’s account, but if this keeps going it’s safe to assume that it will be much harder without a unit with such a passive"
"Darkos, why are you hiding comments?"
Lets be reminded that WE ARE PLAYING A GACHA GAME. We are playing a free game that needs a profit to keep the game running.
Honestly who gives af. If you don’t like it then skip the character. Really that simple.
Barbara nana bailu: you're a worthy necromancer welcome to the squad
"Lore accurate? Who created that lore, then?"
"HSR has really gone downhill, sigh"
"Its not that Castorice's passive is broken, but rather the future implication. The passive itself is not actually that broken tbh Bailu already has something similar but the fact that any team can have is more concerning. The whole thing couldve been avoided by literally just having Castorice being on the team for it to activate and removing the ""obtaining"" part but nah Hoyo really pushing the boundarys"
"If it’s based off a lore 
Why don’t they make like jing yuan have global passive too 
Their excuse is kinda pointless"
Im getting her no debate
"One of the livestream topic that didn't stick out in the spotlight is the animation, the devs said that they'll start putting in character trailers level animation in the game which is a good thing imo. Almost feels like in Hi3rd again"
"I’m not going to sugarcoat it, she IS waifu bait, she IS too OP, she powercreeps literally all other DPSs, and Hoyo wants to make her revenue as good as possible by nerfing Anaxa and making him good but completely mid so that Castorice fans can still argue that Anaxa isn’t completely IGNORED by Hoyo to some extent."
I loose on mydei and finally garunteed castorice😂
"Im good with that, its a mostly useless passive, so it doesn’t matter. Even if it sets a precedent for future passives they’re probably not gonna matter just like this one. 
Still pulling for my purple woman 🙏"
Doesn’t Bailu do the same though? She’s able to revive one party member once per match too.
"It’s not really that powerful in my opinion.

It can only be used once per battle and it revives on 1HP so the character might get killed again before they can be healed."
Typical Hoyo
"I'm temporarily fucking done with HSR, I ain't logging in for 3 weeks so I can qualify for the returnee. Game did nothing but to piss me off.

This gives me more time into playing Wuthering Waves and Warframe.

I'll only play Genshin just for events and dailies with little less playtime. Fuck that shit too."
This will have a sure survival if u mess up in MoC or DU run but so long its a one time revive and hp stay to 1hp im not worry much. What i do worried is the posibilities of future character will do same as this passive global
"Why peeps are like this? It's not like this is genshin who only give less than 2 pulls free for each minor update....this is hsr where you have at least 10 pulls each update....and anniversary will be 40+ pulls free (as in literal free that you only need to sign in, and I'm not including the rewards from events, so for me castorice is really a given character too along with Ruan mei or luocha)

Plus this is just a trial thing again for whatever they plan for Emiya....im sure all battles will look like echo of war for his global passive"
"My team dies and get revived, 1 sec later the boss uses fup attack 😂"
"Or maybe you should think about why female characters having OP powers bothers you so much? Aren't yall the same ones who praise male characters for their skills while crying about how 'MID' female charas are? Y'all wanna cry sexism now when all youre doing is hating on every female character that comes out calling her ' waifu bait' while you're the ones gooning to LADs and whining about more male characters all while simping over fanart and declaring why male charas are better. Shut up. At this point,yall just don't want women anywhere near you. It only gets to a point before y'all start finding dumb excuses like this. As if this hasn't happened before with male charas. Aren't yall the exact people crying for husbandos? Also i never saw you when Dehya kit was declared mid? Was she nerfed as well for Alhaitham to remain a good dendro DPS? No right? See how stupid you sound?"
 @Childefan6969 grass. Touch it.
"because is to deterr f2p from pulling artoria, because is a once in a lifetime banner, and the revenue in that banner will be split from Type Moon and mihoyo because those with artoria will boost their account of 300% worth"
 @Childefan6969  Sexist? I’m not being sexist. Girls are proven to sell better. Just facts.
"Besides, I’ve never played LADS before"
"​ @Childefan6969  most male characters for some reason have been doomed to be in the second phase of the banner, which we all know is going to mean Hoyoverse is going to ignore them to oblivion. This has consistently happened ever since DHIL's banner and only temporarily ended with Sunday's banner. But still, even the future male characters after Sunday have been doomed to second phase of the banner. We aren't going to forget what happened to Mydei, who was supposed to be a powerful unit, got bricked by hoyo with his automated attack during his turns in his enhanced state. Now Anaxa isn't even beating Jade in terms of sub-dps, who mind you, is supposed to be The Herta's 'BIS support' next to Tribbie, and his buff are negligible. His solo dps got nerfed despite having the intentions in his kit. If they keep bricking the men, the fandom will still be in gaslit into thinking 'male characters don't sell well in gacha games'. Yeah, on a game where kit outweighs the actual characters(designs, characterization, etc) themselves, making  them foreshadowed with shitty kit will obviously make then underperformed in banner sales. I don't hate female characters, I pull for them too due to likeliness(I got Tribbie after the Trailblaze quest :3) but if this keeps up, then yeah, people will complain, though it is what as you said, filled with unsavory and misogynistic undertones."
 @Childefan6969 off ur meds?
"​ @link8247  but Artoria will be a skin, the gacha is Shirou🥵"
"​​ @lovingorilla No , I'm sane fortunately unlike you. You have got to be kidding me if you think criticism and hate is similar in any f*cking way. I want more male characters too but the way the fandom goes about it is plain icky. Y'all were simping for Mydei because he's half naked but Varesa has a short skirt so she's automatically waifu bait? Also lesbians exist. It's not only the male fans being serviced like you guys love to claim as an excuse to dismiss a fenale character and refuse to see past her appearance.Yall just want to sexualize men too. Let's not play victim and claim to see only one side of the coin. Hoyo definitely needs to do better but my problem is with people like you who hate being in the vicinity of women online. Like? Did y'all not see the absolutely senseless hate train for Jade, Chasca,Rappa and even Varesa now. You can also count in Castorice now too. The comments are not criticism for company but filled with hate and Misogynistic intent. Always bashing women charas like - ohh why does she have a kitty? I don't like charas with kitty etc- i have actually seen such exact comments. Its plain weird how in the big year of 2025 ,youre going to seriously tell me I'm insane for defending women? Like have we fallen that far as a community? Did y'all not see how the only time HSR fanbase was happy recently was during Sunday's Banner. All the girls, i repeat ALL the girls were hated just because they had a banner before Sunday. Y'all are delusional if you think what you're doing is right and feminist or whatever."
"Fugue literally also had the same fate being released alongside Sunday.
She was heavily nerfed from her original kit (when it wasn't even that broken and just.. good) while Sunday kept getting buffed, powercreeping all the other Harmony units.
Making Fugue seem a ""luxury unit"" while Sunday becoming a ""meta/must-have unit""

Did anyone say shit? YES, quite a bunch of players.
 Did they do anything? NO."
She ain't better than herta😂 what are u talking about
"@ No, all I see is a person who goons to LADS themselves, plays Yandere sim and simps over Castorice and Firefly."
​​ @Kallaroid Was this comment supposed to target me? Asking just in case since I don't want to cook someone for a misunderstanding.
 @link8247  Deter like in 3-4 patches in the future where the f2ps can save more ?
"If you think this is worse, wait until Honkai's mary-sue Elysia variant Cyrene gets introduced later. Hoyo break the lore just for her alone."
@mira-uf1ie  What do you mean they break the lord just for her ?
@mira-uf1ie  What do you mean they break the lore just for her ?
 @MikoWhackingEi    how about aventurine? phainon?
" @xeenooo  Hoyo wanted to make her throne-level emanator, that is more powerful than emanators like Acheron and Herta. All because she is their beloved mary-sue child. In the game, the power level is Aeon > Emanator > Pathstrider. But Hoyo added a special level just for her (below Aeon but above Emanator). Oh, and they will introduce new combat mechanic just for her too."
"@FoxYuushaZ  Phainon has potential like Sunday to be in first banner, we'll see. But Aventurine? He was closer to being an anniversary unit, of course he'll get special treatment."
@mira-uf1ie  Did they already reveal her kit ?
 @xeenooo  it is leaks. Beware.
@xeenooo  Not yet. But hopefully they will scrape that. She is better off as npc since Hoyo will make her op just because she is their beloved mary sue.
"@MikoWhackingEi  Anaxa is the anni unit, and look at what they did to him."
@MikoWhackingEi  Is she a remembrance ?
"​ @Childefan6969 she did not compare them by gender? I mean Waifu bait is kinda popular for gacha games nowadays, same with husbando bait so there's nothing to do with gender imo. Waifu bait is the same with husbando bait, gender war are going crazy nowadays huh.."
 @mira-uf1ie  emanator of what ?
"​​ @esmondgoh3112 exactly, these people act as if the existence of a female character is fan service. How in the hell is Nahida fan service? People who have these thoughts about them are more at fault here. But of course, the fandom yearns for men men and only men. Why should they bother to have common sense that a child character can exist without being weird or an object for some gratification of kinks? Can't remember the last time a fandom was ever happy with a female character. It's like everywhere I go, all I see is 'Men better btw' 'I like Xxx( man) character more' ' Xxxis my bbg' and proceed to hate on the actual bbg character. Like what? If y'all want to spend on only boys to date and ship go play dating sims or other gacha games like LADs or Obey me or whatever. Why bring this BS into RPG games? A genre where apart from HOYO games, all other games are male centric. Didn't see anyone complaining then"
 @xeenooo  Of Fuli. But her status is higher than Acheron and Herta.
"​ @lovingorilla off your job? Wait.. you don't have one, do you? Neither do you have common sense."
@mira-uf1ie  Is there an explanation why ? Lore wise ?
 @xeenooo  not sure. I haven't seen of any info on it yet.
 @MikoWhackingEi  So we're just assuming it ?
"​ @Childefan6969 oh, you're so right about this"
"​ @Childefan6969  Look at you crying when you have a harem of billion girls, insecure regardless of the sea of waifu u have? Gonna burn husbando lover houses?"
 @Childefan6969 your ignorance is showing calling people sexist without them even being sexist is wild
 @Childefan6969 oh wait nvm I read it wrong sorry for misunderstanding
"Nothing you have said even correlates to her being waifu bait.

You're basically saying any strong character who's a female is a waifu bait."
"@mira-uf1ie  She was blessed by death, that does not make her OP at all though, that just makes her an exception."
"​@mira-uf1ie  And how is she a Mary Sue, she's bound to be alone, since she kills anything she comes in contact with, a Mary-Sue is an Author's insert, meaning, freakishly OP, no flaws, and always loved by everyone, she's not that"
​ @mira-uf1ie also she's from a place with very different laws compared to the rest of the universe
"​ @mira-uf1ie she was never stated to be an emanator, she was just stated to be blessed by death"
"​@user-z6y7 Have you seen Dr. Ratio, or Mydei, or Sunday, are you saying those don't appeal to women?"
​@user-z6y7 or is that out of the question since Castorice is strong?
 @tyutyururu  Read my comments properly. I was talking about Cyrene NOT Castorice. And you will find out what Castorice really is in 3.2. There is a reason why she can understand and talk to the Titans.
 @xeenooo  Nothing. Hoyo wanted to make Cyrene op because her HI3 counterpart is their beloved child.
@mira-uf1ie  I thought it was Kiana ?
@xeenooo  Elysia seemed to have replaced that position.
" @mira-uf1ie  oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see that, but I still think Kiana is the favorite, Elysia is just VERY lore important"
" @mira-uf1ie  and since we're talking about flamechasers, yes, you're right."
" @tyutyururu  But that is HI3. If they are trying to force the same thing here it might backfire instead since they wanted to put her above the fan-favorite Acheron and Herta. Hoyo can't seem to understand that not everyone is into HI3, nor would this make people want to like HI3 due to the blatant favoritism + the horrible way they treated it."
@mira-uf1ie  according to who ? tourists ?
" @xeenooo  According to Hoyo Japanese game magazine interview, they are going to slowly merge HSR world with HI3. Fans did not like this, because they wanted HSR to be a standalone series.

As for the Elysia thing, it was very obvious no? Oh, it was HI3 players who said that, and I doubt they are tourist, seeing as it has less playerbase than other Hoyo games internationally."
"​ @esmondgoh3112  While FF was treated better than a lot of characters in this game, her animation is lackluster af and guess what hoyo fixed about it, a slightly better BG, wow.

It doesn't matter even if we complain cz ppl are too busy blaming each other instead of Hoyo and their incompetence"
@ FF was given better treatment because she was based on Shaoji's girlfriend lol.
"I still wish Anaxa's able to do good damage honestly, I need a new Wind DPS since my Blade isn't doing his job properly 💀💀"
"​ @mira-uf1ie she's Ice Remembrance iirc? But she'll increase speed afaik, I feel like she'll replace RMC"
"​ @mira-uf1ie  honestly, I want HSR to be its own world, like I know it's ""Honkai"" but just please, can't we have two seperate worlds for once? 🥲🥲, I hope they balance Cyrene"
I 1000% agree with your comment I'm tired seeing hyv always favor the female characters more but yeah not surprised anymore since their main target audience are mostly the incels men
" @youtubeisntallowingmetocom9062  No way they will balance her lol. She is Hoyo's fav child. They will make her stronger and have higher status than normal Emanators like Acheron and Herta.

I don't know if she will be Ice Remembrance though. March 7th SP will be one, and like Castorice, she too will have Global passive.

Unfortunately Hoyo already mentioned in thrir interview last year that they will slowly merge HSR with HI3. They really are that desperate to force people to play/like HI3."
 @Kallaroid imagine being mad a female has a powerful kit 😂 average female in hoyo fandoms
 @Kallaroid Complaining about ‘waifu bait’ when you are probably gooning to male characters is insane it’s like females shouldn’t exist
" @bang_ladon3125  Except this female character is Hoyo's mary sue. She will be given special treatment just because of that. If she is given the same treatment as Acheron or Herta, nobody would get angry. But just because she is the variant of Hoyo's beloved child, she alone will be received such treatment. She hasn't even done anything worthwhile beside stealing MEI's place by Phainon's side. Whatever her special treatment is should have been given to March instead."
 @mira-uf1ie  Do you even know her lore in HI3? Kinda curious
@นิชานายา-ฒ2ถ  I know. And I also know that she is Shaoji's waifu. But that is HI3. He shouldn't have brought her to HSR. He really didn't learn anything from Firefly.
"​​​ @mira-uf1ie  I don't really see the problem about them slowly merging HSR world with Hi3's, both games already have a direct connection because of Welt and tbh it was going to happen eventually regardless because they'll need to progress Welt's plot, I'd it all depends on how they execute it, if they're able to make that it's not necessary to play Hi3 to properly understand HSR like how it currently is then that would be great but if they go for the other route that they're desperate to attract more players to Hi3 then that would be pretty shitty move"
" @fishman689  That's the problem: they are desperate to attract more players to play HI3, since HI3 is Hoyo's beloved game. Hence why they are slowly merging both worlds. Seeing as Vita became member of Masked Fools after they added Sparkle there, I wouldn't be surprise if they will add Vita to HSR in the future to attract players to HI3. And they expect HSR players to go check HI3 for characters' lores for the variants added in HSR. Shitty move alright."
"​​​ @mira-uf1ie  as a Hi3 fan I'd say that at this point they should just stop trying and just make Hi4 if they want to attract players, the main reasons why they couldn't get players into Hi3 is because of how old it is even after Part 2, and seeing how much the game is behind newer games, and how the plot is going in Part 2 along with the fact that this game has a female only character roster wouldn't attract the general audience even though they have male characters that have perfect potential to be playable like Kevin, Welt, Otto, Kalpas, etc (I know they're partially playable in the story but they're actual playable characters that you can use in combat and stuff) and male characters like Zhongli, Blade, Neuvillette, etc did attract a lot of people to Genshin and HSR and I'm saying this as a dude myself I had no internet in Genshin until I saw Zhongli and thought ""dang this dude looks pretty sick"", I'd honestly like that Hoyo just makes Hi4 that continues whatever the hell they're trying to do and either EOS Hi3 and create an offline version that doesn't include gacha for like $20 or something, or leave it in the state like how they left GGZ, or the most unlikely one EOS the game then make a full fledge AAA remake that streamlines the story, give Adam an actual personality and probably make APHO's writing better and also have playable male characters because they didn't have to put this much effort into them if you can't even play them"
" @fishman689  Isn't that why HSR existed in the first place? They couldn't add playable male characters in HI3 because the CN male players got angry at the thought of their waifu cheating on them. Even Adam got hated because of that, no? So they created a new Honkai game, but this time with male playable characters added from the start instead.

Since Hoyo loves HI3 very much, they should just focus on making HI3 good instead of forcing HSR players to go and play HI3 instead. Amphoreus is boring because it is a rehash of Elysian Realm all over again (with Cyrene of course being the god). I heard that the next planet would be Edo Star, so we will be seeing the Sakura of HSR.

Speaking of Adam, I don't mind Hoyo porting him to HSR. He would be much better in HSR than in HI3 (so long as they don't mistreat him like they did with Phainon that is)."
" @mira-uf1ie  allegedly that's one of the reasons why they created HSR but HSR was in development around the same time as Genshin so they probably just thought that might as well should make this game mixed gendered as well from the get go especially since the protagonist that they just designed is male, and that they are bringing Welt into it, Adam did get a lot of hate from CN players so Hoyo tried to please them by making him into a generic self insert and stripped away his personality (remnants of it are still present in it game especially with his interactions with Lyle) they ended up shooting themselves in the foot because of this as CN players still disliked him and people who wanted male characters were disappointed. Fortunately the fanbase developed a personality for him like how Persona fans developed a personality for their MC's by the dialogue options obviously this ended up in two types of groups: one who claim that Adam is a harem protagonist, and the other that everyone loves that the dude is just chasing after the paycheck, if Hoyo were to port him to HSR they'd have to give him a proper personality so I'd like him to use whatever they were originally planning for him + add the paycheck joke that fans created, and not have some sort of relation with Mei (in this case Acheron) I'd like him to be a character who can stand on his own"
​ @bang_ladon3125 Yeah as a woman I'm so embarassed and appalled at the height of internalized misogyny in these people. They never would have complained about a supposedly OP character if it was a male and it would only make them simp for him more. These girls are basically femcels similar to the chinese incels who can't stand the existence of their gender in a game. They just don't want to admit they don't like seeing their fav man with women. Classic mentality of women whose mund have ingrained fandom culture. So much jealousy and contempt for a fictional character? All these women need to get a life if they think this female OP character is in any way a huge issue.
"​​ @a_renns ah of course. The same female characters that get absolutely sidelined by the fandom and hated on from day one for simply existing are fanservice and privileged, got it. How does your mind work. Is your mother also fan service btw? Are you? Isn't your existence itself appealing to men and hence you're automatically fan service that wasn't meant to exist. See how absolutely braindead you sound? A female character having OP skill set is NOT privilege or Fan service. By your logic Mydei is a conservatively oriented and appeals to only men too right? Since he's so obviously fan service and popular too? With a great role to play in the story? 😂 How truly dumb are you? I'm actually quite concerned for people with your way of thinking. If it bothers you sooo much maybe just go play LAD's. You know? No straight boy or supposed 'incel' is playing that game to be able to 'disturb' your experience. Stop playing HOYO games. All this whining for naught."
The reason HSR gives more pulls is because they release twice as many characters
"You clearly have not even opened the wishing menu right? Why do you think 40 pulls mean anything when there are 6 banners running at the same time? Compared to how many banners run, they should give us 180 to guarantee atleast 1 of the 6 characters."
Wait do people think 10 pulls an update is generous? Wow...
Im just do daily job and out event dont even do this game not full time play game my full time is genshin so i dont care shjt 😂😂😂
Idk feels similar to pneuma and ousia in Fontaine including abyss and travel mechanic in natlan
"i’m so glad i don’t play hsr anymore, it quickly became pay to win. you cant really play the game without 5* and some 5* quickly get powercrept by newer ones"
WHO DONT LIKE HSR JUST GO QUIT AND DELETE EZ
Me who doesn't care about global pasive and just want her dragon be like:yeah i don't care about the pasive just aim for her dragon
"Future relic sets be like:

2pc: When wearer hails from Amphoreus, increase atk by 250% and max hp by 400%
4pc: When wearer hails from Amphoreus, increase CRIT rate and CRIT dmg by 100 and 500 separately"
"Just roll for her, What ever, or dont and dont get the passive if u dont need it, isnt different from meta or waifu, do What u want, dont throw a tantrum over a new mechanic"
Yeah i already knew this kind of ability gonna exist sooner or later. We already have the blue shield buy doing this.
JUST FUCKING PLAY THE GAME!
Single pull luck dont fail me now
Plot Twist: Hoyo gave Castorice this Global Passive so that weird Tiktok player finally can beat something like Aventurine or Feixiao in the Story or later Nikador. xD
"They might get away with being 'faithful' the her lore as a queen of death or whatev to justify the passive, but as a first implementer other dev studios WILL take notes and consider implementing it. Which is a SERIOUS CONCERN"
Nah this is just favoritism by hoyo
I only pull for Castorice because i fell in love with her
"Those who conplaining about this, have you even play worst pay to win game? U mean real pay to win game."
"People who defend it because of the lore are stoopid...
The problem isn't that it's not lore accurate, it's that it forces you to pull for her. It would have been better to give the passive to anyone who completed a certain quest, like LITERALLY ANY RPG WOULD HAVE DONE!
>:("
"For me, Her passive skill even not in party is considered too OP. It may match the lore but that excuse is horrible. Justifying anything by using lore is terrible move. If there's characters that the lore tell us about his/her undefeated streaks and the skill make you win anyway then why we need to play. (Don't be a smart a... tell me that her skill isn't pay to win because it just revived you... etc. you knew what i mean.)

This is also cause the problem with designing challenge. Imagine they consider this skill as requirements to perform well in challenges. Then other whom haven't her will be suffer.

I would suggest to let her buff team just for a bit instead. It doesn't effect gameplay much and still benefits whom have her.

And for tactic revenue, i believe we had already seen this kind of tactic before. But guess what? no one care that much and let it pass for some reason even it's clearly."
"I think I understand now why it’s such an issue, but for castorice’s case, it’s going to be a skill issue if you die. You can always restart the encounter anyway and you need to recieve healing or a shield to properly revive. So if you are thinking of going sustainless then it’s not going to work. I might sound tone deaf but I don’t care"
I have given up on hsr the global passive breaks the game
Not  like they forcing you to get her like I don't mind her global passive idk why people are mad but I'm pretty chill with it like I've had a few fight where my character was down in one shot and ngl having her or not is good either way and change the team comp a bit more
 @kiwee4577  sure and whats wrong with that? If other dev studios pick it up whats wrong with that? Literally NADA
​ @Im_Motivated-Ayato  cause powercreep is already pretty big issue in hoyo games and if they get away with stuff like this what's stopping others to just implement something that will crank that powercreep to 100
If other dev are taking notes.. as someone who plays CRK I'm cooked ☠️
 @Shreggy That game’s powercreep is already concerning lmfao
" @1SpIashh  fr, like if they gonna add global passive trough character (since global passive were already exist via Laboratory) idk what they gonna cook (maybe insta kill or something crazier)"
Expect hsr was never meant to be one?
Why would you let HSR slowly become like those game? you realized that this is the beginning of a bad trend. Power creep will only get worse and the game will become more pay to win.
For me this is a huge help idc about what y'all say Castorice is good addition to my lineups.
People are fearing for something that will happen in future. I don't play hsr but it's funny to see the current state of the community especially when they felt do superior to other gacha games when it released. This is what happens Once the fanbase got stable after release and no game is generous for players experience. These companies are only generous because it's their marketing.
"It's not really that big of a deal, it's not like you can suddenly play sustainless and not get punished for it. You still need a healer in your team, which doesn't change much compared to how team building works previously. 

Sure, you can argue that it sets a bad example for future character, like having x character would give you permanent 10% def ignore even if that character is not in your team. But i think hoyo knows it too that if they do that, it won't end well.

For now, castorice ability imo is alright, it's not meta breaking or anything, it's just a cool side bonus."
"why are people glazing it in the pretense it's so cool being lore accurate? i get there's moments where that's good but there's more serious matters that take priority. If people hadn't grown up with these kinds of games maybe there'd be hope to reject these practices but at this point only the government can do something. Gachas heavily manipulates you with dopamine rewards, incentives, they've brainwashed the population, it's over for the common folk and they literally lost the capacity to think"
But we have another character who revives fallen teammates 😅
"Even if she has a revive passive, still wont pull for her"
"What? People here doing endgame modes 0 cycles with no sustains and say that it makes Endgames easier?



Grow up"
The interesting part about all this the only people complaining is the west.
"One of reasons why I stopped playing hsr around 1 month ago, when I saw leaks"
If yall are complaining about her then don't sommon for her simple as that 😂
I want to get castorice but the global revive bothers me cause I don't know if I'll be able to turn off the passive manually. I like my risky teams that end with a character at 25 health
"if they going to add more global passive in the future, they should just add it to every character and limit the amount of global passive that can be used."
People hate her cuz they can’t get her 😂😂😂
If it was Amphoreus only whatever. But yeah this could be a grim start to a worse future.
Devs: we will give free irrelevant 5 star char just to forget about this. We will also buff old char after 2 patch so you can stay on the hook and spend more money😂 i can see a new yatch and nuke reactor for Dawey😂
Wait wait wait. Not on the team? What is this bullshit?!
"Until there is a Global Buff that boost damage
I don't really think it's ganna be that much of a headache"
Its horse armor all over again...
"Even if it's following the lore, it's a bit too much to have. I would accept if there is limitation to such mechanic such as limiting to just available on Amphoreus ground or Amphoreus in nature (when facing Amphoreus enemies for example). Consider this: Thanatos is a Titan on Amphoreus and has no influence to the cosmos outside, at least not yet."
Let us all admit hoyo likes to power creept all new characters
"You won't even see people who would disagree. If everyone can just get her for free, only a small amount of people would complain because the main problem will always be the gamble on getting her."
"People now just fear the problem that doesn't exist. They are treating like you need a certain character to hop on the game or else you are going to lose all their bank account. ""oOo WhAt iF tHeY pUll oUT a sUb dPs paSsiVe"" so they are saying we will not be using the on field character in the future to battle in a turn base game??? The people that complaining is either a severe gambling addict or people that brag you about them getting $10 shirt for $20."
"Hoyo made Mavuika an event 2-3 months after her banner ended. If you had Mavuika the event was easy, it was tailored for her abilities.... Otherwise even if you are a whale you might have failed. Do you really think Star Rail won't have a future boss that needs the passive?🤣"
No one hates her? 😭 they hate the global passive feature
Now all the future 5star characters must have a global passive or else they suck.
"the shill no brainer doesn't understand the fact that if they implemented a Global Passive, 100% they'll Powercreep it by more BROKEN GLOBAL PASSIVE WHILE MAKING THE ENEMIES MORE BROKEN TOO, TO BALANCE THE FCKING GAME"
Funny how people still don't see Mydei reviving infinitely as broken or a problem even tho it's totally lore accurate.😂 Looks like Mydei got a pass for some reason lol.
If lore mechanic truly implemented on gameplay Acheron should have a mechanic that one shot everything regardless whoever it is. Not just on her technique on mobs.
That passive is useless for obtaining a 3 star
I just dont think it matters that much. Gacha games are preditory at base...what do you expect from one of the best gachas.. idk ppl are just so blind. Just have fun. Its a game thats what its meant for
"I’ll say it like i always had, HSR is just making the kits canon to their lore-self"
"It ain’t like the game has a PVP system lmao now that I could understand, I wouldn’t like that at all if it did. I dunno 🤷‍♂️ why all the tears 😭 for ppl just cry over everything"
"This has a easy fix.
make it so you get that passive by completing the 3.2 story even without owning her
that way it still lore accurate"
Im gonna be real if you NEED a guaranteed revive per battle you might actually need to go back to kindergarten
Powercreep in a gacha game ? why am i not surprised.
Just wait until there's a character that is almost the same as jade lore wise (because the Twitter hate her so much for some reason) and that character give a permanent 100% crit damage to all characters.
They should just put a on/off switch for this
"The passive is a problem bcuz it works even when outside of the team, the real problem and concerned are how ""normal"" will this become? All u need to do is make some jackshit lore about authority of death whatsoever and it's okay, Lmao

Yes my comment related to what drago said about lore type of stuff. Sure we need to harmonize both lore and skill so that the game is more enjoyable but man we all know it's bs"
As long as her passive is only active when she's in team I'm okay with it.
So... is this information already officially confirmed or is it still based off the leals we got awhile back tho?
"jokes on you i donnt die, i just cannt complete moc under 10 cycles."
I think its better if they make it like wild hunt heathclif passive in limbus company where the person gets revived gets damage up but dies after the round
I wish those who dont like it will quit. Less toxic
"This community really are good at doomposting aren’t they? Why are you dumbass needlessly worrying about something that isn’t happening yet? Yea global passive that increases damage will be a thing in the future but do you think devs are stupid enough to make them too overpowered? That literally just them shooting their self in the legs, the passive in the future could be like 5% atk, 10% crit dmg. Divine keys in HI3 is the same as global passive yet they aren’t even that helpful, you can literally clear all the content without touching the divine keys. You guys used fomo as an excuse as if not getting a characters that gives 10% crit dmg to all unit in team is going to make you immediately unable to clear MoC."
"Yeah? Well why doesn't Castorice 1 shot ennemies in the overworld or in combat? That's canon too so where is it?
That's because it would ruin the game
Bad gameplay decisions aren't magically good because it's ""lore accurate"""
same
"Skill issue, just bring some E2S1, also pull for Sunday"
​ @legacymse7095 that's not skill issue.. that is jade issue ☠️
"​ @legacymse7095 anyways you don't really need E2 and S1 (ik you're probably joking but) I clear the newest MoC easily with only like 5-6 cycles (I know it's long, I'm not really good at building characters)"
"My issue is that lore wise she's not supposed to be this powerful ... shes like above the level of Eminators.

Since they are going down this route, they should limit it to characters that can back it up with lore and story.

Maybe limit they passive to only be efective when fighting Amphoreous Enemies"
So basically people are upset that a character YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO GET happens to be good and as a result make the game easier
"Relax guys even if we are forced at least she has global revive, a dragon, a scythe, shes quantum and one of not gonna be rare in the future remembrance unit"
"No wonder there's no another Seele rerun, its lore accurate"
"Hoolay see this as absolute win

He can kill us as twice as much"
Some of yall have way too much free time on your hands to complain about this.
"Bruh those META slave are really stupid 
This is only a game, just gacha what you want and just ignore the META

What the point if you playing but don't enjoy the character, you doesn't need to fully clear all the content in game

Like example in genshin when neuvilette came out he is so broken but i didn't gacha for him cus i really didn't like male characters 
Even my spiral doest reach 12 but i still enjoying all my character..."
Схожее говорили про Ахерон
"Yeah, this whole “global passive” concept is way absurd. Even in pvp oriented games like epic 7 do not have this kind of thing. Castorice passive, yes it’s not OP. However it will be the start of other OP passives in the near future, because the devs have planned to implement this in future characters in this year.
About the rewards, which many people “happy”, it isn’t that good. 
First, free 30 pulls - same as last year anniversary, nothing special. 
Second, free luocha/ ruanmei, a character who is going to be replaced by that hyacine in 3.3 and the other one is already on the other side of the hill like seriously the hell devs doing? 
Third, changes in 50/50 system, we can get seele/blade/fuxuan now. That’s a big L, who’s gonna use them? Seele can moc 12 with ONLY world class relics and OP support so don’t use that argument. Other cases like blade is the same with Seele
Final, changes in shop, we can get limited characters/lightcones - a change for Whales 👏👏👏
Not to mention the powercreep situation is insane now. Devs announced they will buff Sw, kaf, jingliu, and blade IN 3.4? Why so slow? By the time the buff arrives I doubt it will solve the problem.
I can see they are following the HI3 path now."
People really crying over a global passive in a single player game🥴🥴. lmao
"Nobody forces you to pull the character because of the passive. If you need a second life to clear endgame content youre just bad at the game. Most of the people that already clear all end game content dont even need a second life to beat it (and no im not referring to whales). If you like the character, pull for it. If you dont like the character or the archetype, dont. The majority of people complaining are the minorities that go ""powercreep is bad except when its my favorite character"" because i know for a fact that if anaxa got this same treatment the anaxa followers hating on cas wouldve been real quiet"
"People who've been playing for months without any need of a reviver won't give two shits even if this passive exists,, volcal minorities shouldn't be used as a reliable source of player feedback"
"People who support this kind of global passive and said no need to pull if you doing just fine then wait till there are 10 global passive in the game and now your fully built team can’t beat a bird on the side of the road when doing quest lmao, also supported this idea because of lore??? Lmao. + “this is fine because it’s my waifu” yeah until there is a dude with ATK global passive then this people will start crying, brain dead"
"if we're talking about ""lore accurate"" here, she's not really immortal isn't she? also even if she is, the express crew isn't really immortal so that doesn't make any sense?  pls enlighten me"
"Well that doesn't change the reason for me to pull for Cas, STILL GOING STRONG WITH PULLING FOR WAIFU. THAT'S RIGHT MY ACC STINKS WITH WAIFU"
"The only way to make Global Passive a lot of sense is to use account progression.

The more characters and duplicates (Eidolons) you have, the more buffs you have on your account."
"Based on some info from a Hoyoverse post. We may all get one copy of Castorice for free. Which is genius marketing really. Her E1 is nearly mandatory and her LC is straight up mandatory for her. So if you give everyone one copy of her, they can backtrack the global passive idea making a Castorice only thing, and make money from people feeling more obligated to make her playable after getting a free copy"
Now we wait Castorice get powercreep 2 patch later
"Her passive is aight, not better than Bailu, but the problem lies in it being a global passive. If the passive required her to be in the party, sure. But if the community accepts this, they will definitely add more broken global passives in the future."
while i cant fully get on board with this being the first time in hsr its far from being the last time they pull this  lets just hope they can learn from this ''experiment''
I will not give story spoilers but you will enjoy the new quest hopefully and her power scaling
"@Anonymous-jy6gd  Oh? Is this 3.2 content? 

Im fairly caught up with the story and I do know she's like the Hand Maiden of Death, or something 🤔"
"People are upset bc this practically forces us to get her if we want to do well in hsr, and if we dont have her, it would make us struggle in some game mods in hsr like moc for example"
" @Hotaru_ko  not really, this passive wont even be seen most of the time assuming you have a sustain in your teams, only thing it will change is maybe encourage more people to try going sustainless"
"The problem isn't that the character is good, but that every account that doesn't pull for Castorice will be objectively worse. Their entire ACCOUNT.
Like, if 2 players have the exact same The Herta team with the exact same relics and traces and everything, but one of them pulled for Castorice (costs around 300$ worth of jades btw), well their team is better because every one of their character can just not die once.
Then people say ""oh it's just a revive, it's nothing much"" but THAT'S THE POINT. This time it's only a revive, but what will it be next? Maybe it'll be a little bit of healing the team, then maybe a little bit of a follow up on an ennemy, maybe a debuff on all the ennemies, then maybe some Crit Rate increase for the team, then maybe it's the entire character fighting for you even when it's not on the team. The sky's the limit
What we are upset about are these possibilities of account defining characters. And if you think it's not gonna happend? Well, it's Hoyo we're talking about. If they can make more money, they will"
 @Hotaru_ko  you’re acting like this will magically make enemies stronger when it won’t it will just make people that have the character have an easier time but so what it’s not a pvp game so you won’t be harmed by it
 @finiraelkhami8251  it’s not pvp so why do you care that someone has a better character than you if you’re actually good at the game then not having castorice shouldn’t make you struggle if you’re having a hard time with the game it’s not because you don’t have a revive passive it’s because you need to practice on some easier battles to get better at the game
"@ you are doing classic doomposting right now, do you need a reminder that same thing happened with acheron out of combat skill? everyone cried its gonna be overpowered and not having acheron will make your acc worse, and now she's still the only one who can instakill enemies and in the end nobody really cares for it, its simple quality of life feature, and so is said revive, if you need it its just skill issue, if you dont need it, and everyone who has any idea how teambuilding works wont ever need it then it might be just another QoL feature that will save you one unlucky reset on MoC due to enemy targeting"
" @KurumiT0k1saki  except in Acherons case, its just ""nice to have"" sure easier exploration but thats its, you cant use it for bosses nor end game contents like MoC, Pure fiction. 

whilst Castorice is a GLOBAL effect that activates even when shes not in the team , she can stand in bench for all we care and it still activates. Its not really a problem rn, but it MAY BECOME A PROBLEM FOR FUTURE CHARACTERS. Because whats next, a global heal or a global shield that activates when characters get low hp? A global follow-up attack when an enemy gets low hp? A global stat buff (speed, crit r/d) 

yes its not pvp but if JUST HAVING the character makes end game content easier, then its a problem"
" @dlenn1412  my brother you didnt got my point, right now as far as im concerned there isnt a single reliable leak about any other global passive, and people are outraged about global passives being gamebreaking in the future, sure i agree that this might really quickly go downhill but castorice passive isnt anything to be outraged by, and i gave acheron as an example of same thing happening in the past, just wait and see, if next global passive will come out, and its gonna be broken, then its time to be mad, doomposting about assumptions wont change anything"
Or just maybe we love the game and don't want it to go to shit
Well people always will find a way to bitch and cry like a baby. 😂
Some people think complaining about anything at all means you have way too much free time
"Yep, same here!!!"
"People can keep crying over this shit and haters always gonna hate but remember folks, ""WAIFU over Meta""😎"
" @Kyaaa-  THAT'S RIGHT, SPOKEN LIKE A REAL PLAYER. WAIFU OVER META!!"
​ @JingLiuNo1Simp  Good luck with getting Castorice
" @mohamedsaahil7801  Don't worry, I unexpectedly got guaranteed when I got Therta, so if you're pulling for Cas, take all the luck there is"
 @JingLiuNo1Simp Oh thank you 😁
" @Kyaaa- But she is meta..???? Are you slow? Yall seriously acting like criticizing the game for doing something this shitty is hate?? It’s always the hoyoverse community, istg."
" @1SpIashh  bruh why are u mad?😂 i said like what i said and Waifu are worth to pull, ""Waifu over meta"" as always😎 btw since when i said criticizing the game is hate? I'm only said haters are always gonna hate no matter what happens lmao"
"@ You said hates are always gonna hate, implying that people who are against the global passives are hating? Like holy shit. Pull whoever you want, but you can’t call them haters. And honestly, hating on this game rn is justified"
@1SpIashh  you talking bout me or someone else? If it is about haters then I don't pay attention to them or whatever complain about this global passive unless it is related to the in game storytelling
" @1SpIashh  chill bruh take a deep breath, why are u still mad?😂 I've said what I said and I don't need to repeat it 2 times (or maybe 3). If you want to hate this game, go ahead, no one is forcing you to like it and so is quitting😭 but I'll stick with my pulls😎"
@ That literally wasn’t even my point. Aint gonna continue with someone as dumb as you lmfao
 @Kyaaa-  Not gonna continue with someone as dumb as you smh
Teammate dies --> Castorice revives --> SIKE its still Hoolay's turn
"the people not getting on that this is how hyv can get greedier, clearly the people happy here either likes casto or hasnt seen the bigger picture lmfao? 

what if in the future they give future chars CR or CD global passive but its on the character you don't wanna pull for? suddenly its not fun anymore. 

the premise of them buffing old chars is also an illusion since they slowly wanna add more roster to the standard 5050 loss. imagine if they just pull a hi3 divine key on us and release the equivalent of it to force ppl to invest and pull just to make char like blade relevant in the current meta"
"Me enduring years of hell catching up with the high rank players' permanent global passives in guardian tales:


First time?"
"They kept it, I’m so done

Edit: i checked the stream from their channel on bilibili, it seems the cn community are defending it"
"If she is in the team, and its not a global buff, it would be fine"
"Too many of you ppl live in ""whataboutisms"" cheesus crust. And is that true one revive per battle? Someone call the police"
Let's wait for Ten Stoneheart IPC which can double stellar jade earnings
"i’m gonna be honest because yall are blowing this out of proportion. If they were to give future characters passive like this, where’s mydei and his passive? where’s anaxa and his passive? where is tribbie’s passive? yall gotta think. She’s an anniversary character meaning she’s gonna be a little broken. Acheron was the first anniversary character and she got a passive to where she can instakill everything but guess what? it got nerfed to where it won’t work on certain enemies like elite enemies and bosses and trotters. If they really wanted to make castorice and the passive a real ongoing thing they would’ve by now with anaxa and the others that were released. Besides it’s not even that broken. Unless you got a shield or healing in that same turn then you won’t stay alive she’ll instantly kill you again. Slow down and rethink this. Yea globals seems broken and all the more but you have to realize that this passive will be limited to certain area like open world and possibly not even work in end game content"
you need p2w player to not make the game dead 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Bailu revives others too but the fact that she doesn't have to be in the team is broken
"I’d go with both because if I get mydel and if he’s not In vendetta state, Then it will revive mydel just for a backup revival, so I can use Gallagher and get his vendetta state back into action. Right now I lost 50/50 to baliu, so I might get mydel as a guarantee pity"
"""what do you think?"" bro the fandom just needs to chill the heck out like bro. dude. calm your s--t man



(pls 'scuse my language, I'm just upset with how like 89% of the fandom and how they react to crap like this)"
"Remember, castorice is slower which a dps should not never have. Think of this as an replacement"
Idk why people gone crazy for this passive if you have strong sustain your character would never die to activate her passive make a account have her and not have her basically the same. I think those who complain about that just a dumb ass with massive skills issue
thats a fucking 1 hp what are you gonna do with it😭
"i mean if she revives our character in the middle of a boss's turn then it wouldnt do much
if castorice's the only one who has a global passive and doesnt spread to newer characters then i guess it wouldnt really be a problem, but if they decide to add more though, then that would not be good for the game"
"Personally in my mind the devs had TWO OPTIONS. They could’ve introduced global passives as a separate announcement and give existing characters especially the free units passives already. However there’s the second option that they took and outright gave it to the new limited character….

I peacefully left on my own behalf from HSR since 3.0 but idk if I could even tolerate with what’s happening to the game recently."
"Its totally bullshet if u ask me, its agreeable coz castorice lore bla"" if there is 1st case, there will be 2nd,3rd,4th and goes on just coz fvcking lore thing. This same like played a game only to be lead around by developers team. Not pulling? prepared for future hardship, pulling? prepared to skip banner u originally plan to pull. Coz u either F2P or small spender. Let's be real here gacha doesn't guaranteed u got it on 1st shot if u not losing banner 1st, imagine u lose 1st 50:50 to other,yeah!!!!and on hard pity too. U goes another hard pity for guaranteed. Now u had 0SJ nor pass for LC or u goes ""hardway"" again same like before to get the SiG LC. Just coz some character labeled as MUST HAVE CHARACTER OR META. me? Not happy at all, I'm planning to pull anaxa after all!!!I'm already unhappy with my 11 off-banner,11 guaranteed pull, 9 win of 50/50 chance."
"They should have done team passives before Global passives. Like Hook and Clara together lets hook Follow-up whenever clara Counters or Kalfa and Traveler lets the traveler do a Random dot to enemies. 
Jumping to Global passives is throwing everyone's wallets into the deep end"
"I think it's good bcz hsr depends on power creep the enemies are getting strong so the characters should also have to be broken like who would like to use seele in today meta 
The more stronger the enemy the more broken the characters should be 
And this is gacha game u can get a lot of pulls easily in hsr so u can definitely take castoris we are getting almo107 pulls in next update how much f2p do u need bruh"
Yeah not as op as they think only team with healers will benefit this more
"@randomviewer112 i think the main concern isn't that the passive itself is OP, but it opens up the possibilities of actual good global passives that are powercreep incarnnate"
"​ @Joaquin-xq5wo  So all these dramas are about ""whatifs?"""
@bunnyx2819 Yep
"@bunnyx2819 ""Whatifs"" about situations that already happened before, IE Silver Wolf being able to add/negate elemental weaknesses and now like what 4 or 5 characters can do the same thing she does? Like have you seen Anaxa?"
@ bassicly noth what ifs global passives are a thing now and there will be more
"@randomviewer112Up until there’s a character with a global passive that gives 100% crit rate to every character in your account. It sets a bad precedent and the fact that people are defending it it’s just killing the game, y’all are literally turning into the Genshin fandom"
"​ @Athai_   Stop exaggerating. The only characters that can implant their own weakness are break-focused characters, because there's simply no place for SW in those teams and they would be useless without breaking, obviously. The first character that directly powercreeps SW is Anaxa and Anaxa only, after TWO years."
"​@bunnyx2819 yup basically just what ifs and projecting their bad thoughts lmao their basis is that if castorice sells so well they just gonna bring forth future charas with global passives too, keep in mind last year we got acheron(an anniversary character  too btw) who still to this day the only one that has instakill technique, if acheron sells so well why didn't they introduce a new character that basically can just instakill an elite/boss enemy? People quite literally bitch about this for the sake of bitching about hoyoverse game smh"
"​ @Joaquin-xq5wo yeah no it'll be a serious while before we see a global passive like this, remember when aventurine broke the game with his op shields and it sparked a dilemma of how broken future preservation characters will be...guess what no preservation character is released since then 😂"
"@ And your mindset is going to fucking kill the game. Acherons technique helps with overworld exploration by basically removing enemies, her technique doesn’t instakill a boss in MoC. It’s far from the same thing as Castorice’s global passive which helps you out in endgame modes. 

Besides, we did get other characters who also help out in the overwordl massively. Like The Herta locating treasure chests, or Feixiao with the speed boost and who also makes you able to just ignord enemies in the overworld, Rappa with the speed boost as well, or even Robin. There are more. 

It’s really sad to see that people like you are actively defending this shitty and scummy behavior, but I guess if you want Star Rail to die then suit yourself, literally turning into the Genshin Fandom. And Castorice IS going to sell well."
" @ItsBiox  and yet you’re completely wrong because leaks confirm future characters (talking like 2 patches ahead) will also have these passives. Acherons feature is a technique while this is something castorice doesn’t even need to be on the team to provide, so they’re very much different"
​@havidikevidi so basicly you're saying that in two year we will have the castorice powercreep with an even stronger global passive and the game has no good futur perspective. Nice
People who over think her global passive cleary shows that hoyo games are their first Gacha games
"​ @Joaquin-xq5wo and then what? It doesnt matter if it becomes a thing, dont pull for the character if you dont like them its that EASY, if this happened to a character YOU liked your reaction would be a lot more different."
" @Im_Motivated-Ayato  quite the opposite actually. The people “overthinking” this are gacha veterans who’ve experienced this same thing happen to other games and are trying to warn players. Majority of hoyo fans first gacha was genshin impact and since that game barey has powercreep, they think everything is peaches and cream"
"​ @wage942 no it's not gonna kill the game, cuz the game is a story based game, there are NO leader board, it's all for END GAME content which a lot of people dont care much getting 0 cycle or whatever, and lastly even if its an example a 100% crit rate is no where near as ok as all your characters survive AT ONE HP and you also need to heal them up or else they are still DEAD."
"​ @ronreed4050 😂😂😂 genshin has barely any powercreep?? Think Again, and these so ""veterans"" probably has experienced these things on a gacha game with leaderboards"
"@ Your mindset is the reason this game is dying, you’re no different from a Genshin players. 
And I’m not saying her Global passive is “OMG INSANE, YOU HAVE TO GET IT IT GIVES YOU 1 TRILLION BUFFS”. And it baffles me that you don’t get it, because it’s not that hard tk understand.

They are adding this which is negative to the game, they’re going to balance endgame modes around these global passived and are basically giving players the middle finger if you didn’t get the character eith the global passive, the new boss is a prime example, not going into details cause it’s leaks. 
The powercreep is bad enough as it is and this just adds another layer to it. The game isn’t a story game, it’s a gacha game, a game where you pull for characters and use those chaarcters in endgame modes. 
This global passive is extremely bad, predatory and scummy, if you don’t get that then don’t even talk please."
" @Im_Motivated-Ayato  am I wrong. Unlike star rail, 1.0 units are still capable of clearing spiral abyss even after 5 years. Star rail is now reaching its 2nd year and powercreep is already 100x that of genshins. Enemies have 10+ million hp and deal enough damage to one shot without aventurine. They literally had to make a casual mode because story bosses got too hard to beat. Yes newer genshin characters are stronger than old ones, but that balances out because the enemies are easy to beat even with old characters."
" @ronreed4050  lay out the links and sources for this ""confirmed"" global passives the characters gonna have that you got, all the bread crumbs and leaks literally has not mentioned any of it whatsoever unless you got yourself a fake leak that is lmao. If you want to confirm the leaks there's literally a reddit thread specifically for it"
" @ronreed4050  I have not seen a lot of Venti's nor Klee's clearing spiral abyss, not even the first 3 characters genshin gave us for free, cuz ur only talking about the 3 supports. Apart from those 3 any other? And even genshin has reached hp inflations ABOVE 10 mil, so again you are mistaken if you think genshin has NO POWER CREEP, cuz 2 characters Mavuika Citlali."
" @wage942  the game has a story,  and you can use gacha to get characters. Even you a Illiterate person would know that this game has a STORY and not just END GAME content, and no one has a gun pointed at your head to tell you ""FINISH MOC"""
" @ronreed4050  it was rumors not leaks, same leaks that told us Seele and Standard characters are getting a buff and look at whose getting one now. Every new character since 1.x is "" Insane."" Op, must pull, yada yada and people will still skip and not pull."
"@ So now we’re moving to insulting each other then? This is a game not a visual novel. It’s a “TURN BASED RPG GAME”. Why do oyu think they release characters every patch? Why do you think they release new endgame modes? New expansions? Because this is a *game*.
You get the characters to clear endgame content because it’s the main thing that attracts people to PLAY this GAME. 
And if you’re just going to ignore everything I said. Respectfully shut up and don’t talk."
Good comment made me laugh. Yes i hate Hoolay because bro keeps hogging turns
" @Joaquin-xq5wo  just make every character have unique global passive, issue fixed"
"​​​ @ItsBiox Acheron ignores weaknesses and most of the characters after her release ignores weaknesses such as Rappa, Boothill, Fugue, Etc. 

Plus Acheron's technique is only available in the overworld and some parts of SU and does not affect endgame the same way as Castorice does."
Fr
But still it’s like Bailu’s revive
​ @Shadow82311 Bailu revives once and she needs to be on the team.
 @Joaquin-xq5wo are we just gonna ignore the fact they had God keys in HI3? And those are not some super significant global buffs but just something that’s nice to have if you have it but not needed unless you’re competing with players on the leaderboard. Hoyo has done this before and probably knows the right formula for it since they have been doing this for ages(GKs were around for a long time)
"On the bright side, Bailu is no longer the only character with a revive mechanic"
@bunnyx2819 100% another big what if is people think alot of characters are going to get one in the future but so far up till 3.5 doesnt seem like any kits would have one confirmed upto 3.3 wont have any
i believe if you revive with the passive it mantains th chr at 1 hp until they take a turn
" @Joaquin-xq5wo  Hoyo can do that whenever they want, their main audience is Asia and Asia loves this"
"​ @Athai_ SW IS still the Only character that can effectively engate weakness as she IS the Only inplanter with 33% Res Shred. Not saying she's good tho, but she's still the Only Unit with a meaningfull implant."
"​ @Athai_ the problem is Is Silver Wold Exist In early and she's a Debuffer so there's not too much of a Power Creeping and she's perfectly effective in Mono Quantum but being in multiple Element Team even with just Quantum + Any element in team her Elemental change gets Ruin or if you're Fighting multiple enemies who isn't a Quantum Weakness removes her ""OP"" side yes you can apply weakness but the thing is the more elements you have in team the more harder it is to get what you need, me as a Silver wolf user since her First Banner release already Seen this Flaw that's why i only use her in ""Mono Quantum"" because you only have ro worry about 20% Chance of not applying Debuffs to enemies and will always focus on Planting Quantum Element trust me it's more Fun Using Silver wolf in Mono Quantum than In any set up in fact that the only way you can say She's op is she is the Main Carry of ""Mono Quantum"" because she don't have to plant another element weakness and will always land as Quantum, she isn't op or Powercreeping anyone because her Skill and Ulti only land in 1 Enemy at a Time Welt + Seele is Strong even after Silver wolf just released, Castorice on the other hand shows a Big Powercreep Jump and give an idea for even Bigger Powercreep jump in Future because of 1. global buff, this thing is New and ut is kinda Broken but it open up more potential of ""OP"". 2. She's a Remembrance, the Fact she already have a Global buff and then if you use her as active you get another bastard on the Side? And the fact her Eidolon even got Buffed after the Community complain, which is Funny. But anyways im pulling for her not because of Powercreeping w"
"​ @Joaquin-xq5wo As i stated in another post people are giving hoyo way too much credit on global passives.  None will ever be game breaking because it is not hoyos way of making the game easier that way.  Their version of powercreep will always be characters/gear first with global passives being way down the line of what is needed.  Look at HI3, divine keys exist, are global passives but aren't mandatory unless you are in desperate need for 40 x-tals a week."
"​@bunnyx2819 well yeah obviously because those whatifs have already been shown in the power creep already present in the game right now. As much as I love hsr this is taking it too far with a global passive such as this. Look at all the older characters, they're practically useless in the current endgame modes and even the bosses in the story are too hard to fight even with a good build of said characters. And I do love castorice don't get me wrong a lot of the meta characters are my favorites but even so I can't pull for each one so yk it's kinda unfair for them to make characters with such op buffs"
Yh ngl most times this Revive wont do shit unless you lucky enough and Pop heals right after
"​ @ItsBiox I would like to be as brainless as some of you...shame that 4 different global passives have already been datamined, Sike!"
" @darknessinc.Inc830  provide the source then links whatever.  I've seen people saying this same thing and never ever given a source and basically just saying ""trust me bro"" LMAO. not a single credible L3aker has given any info nor crumbs about said global passives that you talked about my guy"

"@bunnyx2819 …if you think them adding more Global Passives(which they already have a name for btw, it’s not like they said it’s “Castorice’s special/signature ability/passive) is an IF and not a WHEN… well I don’t like insulting people, so I’m just gonna say you’re silly"
"​ @Joaquin-xq5wo it is a ""whatif"" the future will even be that op to start the drama"
"​​ @kimaki6866 That's also a ""what if"" why everybody think Hoyo would ruin one of their main income? 😭 they're a multi million company they know wat they're doing"
"​​ @wage942 think about it through, there is no concrete proofs about the up coming global passives will be over powered and must have, Hoyo aint doin dumb moves to just dunk their own income"
 @hydranic27  they know soooooo much what they're doing that for each of their game they have bad reputation increasing and got some boycott and review bombing so yeah sure they know.
​ @wage942 tbf the main thing that attract people was the Characters and Gachas not the endgame contents 😂
"​@randomviewer112 not, th shield also count, but is not op i think"
" @hydranic27  I've seen so many people spread this false info around so much, sad that most casual and oblivious people that didn't know how to check if the info is credible or not (one quick google search you got the reddit thread that specifically talks about said leaks) falls for it. Everyone that I've ask about this global passive info has not given ANY credible or source at all smh"
 @kimaki6866  Tell me u judge a book without reading by not telling
@bunnyx2819 These what if’s are very likely to happen. Seeing the state if the game right now it’s pretty much going to happen (global buffs power creep 💔🥀)
"@ThatGuyWithNoLife  what ifs will always be what ifs, sure more global passives will get added but none gonna make the game unplayable without."
"​@Joaquin-xq5wo  Probably not due to the backlash, on top of the fact that she probably has a global passive because she is the birthday character of HSR"
​@bunnyx2819all these dramas are about potential for money-draining
"​ @ItsBiox technique 💀
It is only useful in SU or overworld if you don't oneshot basic enemies already, and it's not even that useful. You can snowball through the first wave fast but then it becomes useless. We can say that Therta powercrept acheron in that field cause she deals 99% hp damage to normal enemies BUT also deals 30% hp damage to elites and bosses"
"​ @ItsBiox  as a wise fictional villain once said,

""Your reasoning is highly illogical"""
"​ @maingrader4434 I mean dps'es sell better if the stats from revenues are reliable

Also we are getting next preservation in later 3.X. Dan Heng is going to be next preservation unit if nothing will change"
"​ @Im_Motivated-Ayato I don't remember any global passives in my FGO journey, or even in idle heroes"
" @Dorin-here  i point out acheron and her technique specifically as a basis for comparison since both her and castorice are technically categorized as ""special"" anniversary characters and both has something ""special"" on their kit that no one else has.
 for acheron her one shot technique (still to this day no other character has that instakill tech that you can use even without entering combat) and castorice's ""global passive"". The argument here are people basically going on a pointless outrage because of this since they're basically accusing hoyo will DEFINITELY add more (they don't have any solid evidence for that btw) if castorice sells well while people forget how crazy are the sales for acheron too. If acheron sells so well why they don't double down on it and make a new character that can one shot elite enemies too and not just basic mobs? Most people that freak out over this is just freaking out for the sake of freaking out lmao. I also have seen people spreading rumors regarding future ""global passive"" but till to this day not single one of them that i ask has provided solid evidence nor a credible and reliable source for it and are just saying it on the basis of ""trust me bro"""
"​ @Im_Motivated-Ayato That's not how it works.

I am myself pulling for rice but the global passive thing will force players to pull for broken passives on characters they don't like. You will be pulling for features, not the characters at this point, and if you will struggle in any gamemode people will start calling you stupid cause you didn't pull essential global passive when for example phainon would give you the option to equip 2 lcs which would boost your stats by literally double while also getting effects from the 2nd lc.


Being F2P will become unrelatable for whole community

Or imagine if all future characters would give you some sort of global passive, and for example the character you like will get the garbage one compared to his competition, like 20% attack boost vs 20% def shred/res pen/speed"
"​ @Im_Motivated-Ayato But in genshin you have a hyperbloom or what was that called.
A reaction that makes any character from dendro/electro/hydro element able to full clear the endgame content"
"​ @Im_Motivated-Ayato Genshin is also a story game, ZZZ is also a story game.


But the main way of getting the resources for the character you want is from endgame modes.
We got to the point where a lot of players are struggling to clear MoC 11, and while in other games you have mechanics that help like being able to dodge or having really strong mechanics like elemental reactions, hsr has only break which isn't really reliable in the most of times"
"Me if I got Castorice: 
""If you revive, you're not gonna get healed or shielded, you're destined to die, so go back to the dead bish""
or I'll just use their basic attack or restart! Since I do restart whenever someone dies."
"@bunnyx2819They literally did the same thing with Acheron?? They’re obviously gonna do the same thing with castorice lmao. Jesus christ, this is hoyoverse we’re talking about.. stop acting like they wouldn’t do something like that?? Aren’t they the same company that re-made acherons ability to ignore weakness, but much better? Aren’t they the same people that paygated exploration in genshin impact, even behind constellation, JUST TO POWERCREEP them?😭 Stop sucking the dick of hoyoverse. They don’t gaf about you. And you might ask, “how am i sucking the dick of hoyo🤡” It’s because you’re trying too fucking hard to give them the benefit of the doubt, and act like it’s a what if situation, as if they haven’t pulled stuff like this before on MULTIPLE occasions, and considering that my friend was shown leaks of 2 fate collab characters having global passives, I think theres a LITTLE chance that they might be better than castorice’s
(100% if you can’t tell)"
"@havidikevidialr, so why are acheron, feixiao, firefly, rappa, fugue, and boothill. It doesn’t matter if they’ve break focused smh. They shouldn’t be able to IMPLANT weaknesses, or just straight up ignore them? Maybe the game would actually be a bit more balanced if they thought about shit like that lmao, along with people in the community like you."
Not enough proof to cry about it now then.​ @Joaquin-xq5wo 
"Why people cant get around the fact that some people play it just to enjoy the story? Why do they think its always about clearing end game content this and that? I dont even care if i cant clear all of MoC or spiral abyss, i will only lose some extra jades (im f2p, play genshin from day 1 and never clear all spiral abyss), chill and just pull your fav character, build it properly and it can still clear most content, just enjoy the game... and if the game goes p2w so bad you cant win without pulling some character, just leave it and move on ✌️"
"@randomviewer112if you heal or they’re shielded before the teammates next turn, they regain like most of their health. It’s not a 1-1 revive. If they get hit they won’t take any dmg. If they don’t get healed or aren’t shielded before their turn, they die for real"
And her come hoolay with the iron chair
​ @ronreed4050 I remember when Jiaoqiu got leaked. Then people started complaining that he wasn't as strong as the test/leak 😂
Even E1 fu Xuan can tank hoolay after multiple moon rages
 @Hadeshi.  so like as long as you have Castorice and put four different characters on a team setup any of our character die will then get revive infinitely? That’s a good thing. How is it gonna disrupt the game’s balance?
 @Shadow82311  it only gonna get triggered 1 time per battle no more than that
"@bunnyx2819 
These “what ifs” are coming true. According to leaks there’s already 3 characters who has global passives."
 @unibocchi  provide the source? All the credible leakers has not confirm nor has talked about more global passive than castorice's lmao. I seen couple people said this but not even once i received the sources of it
 @unibocchi  provide the source? I've seen couple people keep on saying this but not once they provide the source
" @hydranic27  Dude the fact that the first global passive is a totem of undying, I’d doubt they’ll be any less broken from now on. Assuming that they won’t add more “must-have” characters with insane global passives is putting more trust in Hoyo than they deserve rn."
@ThatGuyWithNoLife  I hope for the bright side why would i put hope in them to add must have characters? The totem of dying aint even that good since it revives at 1 hp and in contrast expecting to add over powered global passives just gonna feed the drama up
 @hydranic27   The devs already dooming the game. Should you be the optimist or the realist is the real question here.
" @hydranic27  On the side note the Totem of undying is very good. It keeps you alive when you really need it like if you're traveling deep into the nether or end without cheats enabled. Also it gives you Regeneration 2, Fire Resistance, and Absorption 2. Not to mention is removes all negative effects from you."
it's fine literally 98% of community pulled for shielding monster
 @ItsBiox  one time per battle so it’s like Bailu’s case. How is it gonna disrupt game balance
" @ThatGuyWithNoLife  better those who straight up insults the game and dig up past drama which are dumb instead of givin proper thought for the game, and no, saying how trash the game is for something it have is not how u want better for the game. That is my main problem with this drama"
"​ @MalevolentCherry Yes we ignore HI3, i mean where is that game now? it s gone from orbit aside from its own fanbase, and people who played the game now only wanted to know the story of either Welt, Himeko and Otto, and  note that this riot wasnt even just because GP only, storytelling that goes down in quality every new patch released, kit locked behind eidolon and LC, HP inflation, powercreep, imbalance meta, lack of good events lately, fomo banner placement and rerun, 4 star : 5star ratio, unclear Remembrance role, p2w annive event, expensive team cost for everytime new character got released, old unit huff being further delayed to 3.4, as well as the disappointment from previous patch like Sunday not being able to pair up with Casto, Aglaea that need expensive team, and Bananacademy's patch.

GP was really just final push of this riot, especially on how Hoyo put this kit on an already overloaded unit like Casto who have all heal, dmg, sustain, and debuff already."
 @hydranic27  So are we supposed to praise the devs for their predatory practices?
@ThatGuyWithNoLife  bro u know how to read the entire sentence?
 @ThatGuyWithNoLife  there is a reason professional criticizers exist among criticizers
" @hydranic27  show me your 3* clear of current endgame with full year 1 team, then talk."
 @Isomeria450  i need to clear the end game to say that most of the community is stupid and dont know how to act? i dont think so 😂 and the fact they decided to attack VAs because of Castorice now pretty much make it a community issue.
The koolaid man strikes again 💀
NOOOOO THE PTSD
"​@bunnyx2819 No there's already leaks about a 3 other characters with global passives including Phainon. Account wide SPD, CRIT and DMG bonus buffs are already leaked."
I always hate those drama makers from twitter/X and other social so much. Making dramatic protest before experiencing the release version 😡😡😡
@kenwilliamang2696  then they're bitching abt a good thing. Too op? Who tf uses bailu anymore? Yet she works the same. You dont gotta get anyone you dont wanna get if you wanna skip then skip you dont NEED anyone in the game except when the game forces new mechanics on you but you can still beat those tv monkeys without Rappa so
@bunnyx2819 yes it is the reason why people thinking that way because of the content creators. For me I don't care with the global passive because this is a PVE centric game not for pvp people taking this game seriously it's like they can't love without this game. Just appreciate what devs is offering. It's already been 2 years they need to release true anniversary unit.
and the char will still die after.
" @Joaquin-xq5wo  yes, it just a small life insurance"
" @Joaquin-xq5wo ah yes, lets wait for their ass to add Phainon, emanator of destruction, has the authority of crit dmg crit rate atk cuz destruction kinda sounds offensive!!"
Not necessarily if you have a healer’s ult ready
"and the team need to have healer or shielder too, if they get revived and not recieving shield or heal then they fall again"
"@randomviewer112 its 1hp, it's not your turn and if you don't receive heal until a specific time count she still kills you again. it's not that broken"
"she will sell as she is a new mechanic character, and is the best dps by now, and still, her banner is the first of the new type banners, and even so, she's pretty asf. how it is not going to sell? having a half ass revive passive that even bailu has, it's not her selling point.  @ItsBiox "
​ @Im_Motivated-Ayato I haven't even touched MOC and doesn't feel bad at all. it's just a hard battle for like? 10 wishes? why would you break up for that? they literally give you 10 wishes every patch
"​ @wage942 even seele, the first character released, can destroy endgame. you don't need castorice or the 100% crit mf, you need to get good and build your characters correctly."
"@ Yeah I need to get 90% crit rate, 200% crit dmg substats on her and a perfect run to be able to clear with her. It’s just cope at this moment, I have Seele and no matter what I try, be it E1 Tribbie or S1 Sunday she just doesn’t manage."
"​ @sukaikitsune like timing right when it happens, with an ult and the huohuo's lightcone"
"@user-fx8cz9dh7t  right.. bcs everybody has HuoHuos lightcone and i doubt you can ""time"" when you die?"
" @user-fx8cz9dh7t  never have i ever said she will not sell my guy, all the drama and BS that happen rn regarding hsr is basically people doomposting about how future characters will for sure have global passives like her (has not ever been confirmed btw) and people out here got tricked into believing fake leaks saying phainon and 3 other characters will have global passive lmao"
@havidikevidi u forgot firefly bro
​ @Im_Motivated-Ayato how is that gonna happen 😭. I hope it does happen to the character I like but that's literally impossible seeing they just bluffing abt buffing old characters
​ @Im_Motivated-Ayato don't be mistaken I like cas but if I pull for her then what next. She gets powercreep and just like that my money wasted
​ @ItsBiox I can smell the future global passive believe me. It's money bro don't u get it🤣
​@bunnyx2819 yeah old characters are getting powercreep. Even my blade gets powercreep. I really hope those characters buff rumours were true
​ @kingsley0403  if they make that (even the old characters) than I had nothing to complain lol🤣
"@bababoey2223  ive done that for like over 100+ characters across all the gacha ive played, I just shrug it off cuz there are things in life that are out of my control, and again its your choice and I should respect it."
" @Im_Motivated-Ayato  yeah I know, most of gacha games are like this. Well, I just do what I could do so that this game would stay goated, if the Devs are ignorant then that's that.But I really hope that hsr would think of different ways to make money rather than this sly way of tricking players to pull for characters that'll soon be useless"
 @user-fx8cz9dh7t   seele destroy endgame link
" @Im_Motivated-Ayato   I don't care at first but when I think back, 100+!!!. And all of them gets powercreep. Bro seriously hoyo done you bad bro. I'm not promoting here but u should try wuwa. Their characters are not getting powercreep(at least for now). Maybe that game will soothe your pain"
 @wage942  can i defend this if I want Honkai Star rail to fail?
"​ @Im_Motivated-Ayato venti is still incredibly broken in mob floors, klee, yeah, shes been doomed to fail since she is just comparable to diluc since release.

Speaking of diluc, bro is actually good now. An og 1.0 character. You say powercreep in mavuika but i have used my Tao to full clear ever since 1.3. point is, even if mavuika isnpowercreep, as long as older characters like Tao, and arlecchino are strong pyro dps, its all good. 

In HSR though, can we say the same about Blade? Jingliu? Imbibitor? Ill ignore seele since if you have no life and grind relics you clear with her but you still need meta support.
Heck, even non Jiaoqiu e0s1 acheron is having issues if not having enough dps lately. In GI you get away with the ogs bennett xq or 1.5 kazuha."
"​@havidikevidi Stop defending bad designs and overloaded abilities just for the act of greed. Meanwhile Arknights has all characters, even low star rating still playable and able to clear content... And Honkai in just two years already going in powercreep spree in order to inventive the need of the new character at all cost  😢"
"Mfs take personal, I also felt this a lot of time 🤣🤣"
"Wrong. I had an Argenti wipe out my whole team, but they got revived, then my Castorice went and then my Lingsha healed the whole team and we ended up winning the fight."
I swear these people are the reason we don’t have English VA’s for some characters
"castorice's global passive ain't  that op when it comes to enemies that has multiple turns such as hoolay but still, It's pretty useful for some end games"
" @bababoey2223  Not rumors, the devs mentioned it and it's coming true."
​@bunnyx2819 don't get me wrong.I really love to have jingliu buffed but I don't have high hopes for this one.
They are hoyobots of course they are not going to notice hyv greediness
"​ @RealLifeSkeleton123  You know she was a special case, right?"
​ @tyutyururu she's for sure not gonna be a special case anymore after they release new characters with the same global buffs as her
"​ @tyutyururu  Not needing energy to ult was a special case for Acheron, now we have Feixiao that Obliterates bosses not even needing to get a single turn.
Forcing elemental weakness was exclusive to Silver Wolf... Firefly.
Summons was a thing of Jim Yuang. We got a whole new type for only summons.
No, she aint a special case nor will be the only one to have it."
What if I just don't care? Are you going to deter me from playing?
" @iliveforchips1186  They can't, since they made her powers connected to lore, I don't think there's any other characters that are blessed with the powers of death."
 @AsraelRedFire  I'll break this down into multiple parts for you
" @AsraelRedFire  about the summons, the general isn't of remembrance, it's not a memosprite, it's an emanator that was given to him."
" @AsraelRedFire  also Feixiao also has one of those ""summons"""
" @AsraelRedFire  about the elemental weakness, you're saying that as if that is the same as a global passive, which it's not."
" @AsraelRedFire  I don't really know what to say for the first thing, since I don't have either of those characters."
" @AsraelRedFire  Hoyo made a special character do a special thing, because of her lore, so why would someone else get that power"
"@xenoemblem7  nobody is stopping you ok, most ppl that criticise still play bcs its a game they love"
"@ the global buff doesn't have to be related to death or lore, they can make it about atk, aspd, def, hp

I'll say it, she won't be anything special after one or two patches"
​ @tyutyururu  Idk much about hsr lore now but is she in the lore can revive people without being there?
"@RealLifeSkeleton123  No, since she kills anything she touches, did you want her to kills everything with a touch, they can't genuinely add that, since that would make EVERY dps useless, so they went for the alternative, she doesn't even res them either, she just puts their death on a longer time, so if you don't heal, they're going to die"
​ @tyutyururu  guess she is not lore accurate then
"Well idgaf, because i dont decide my pulls based on that global passive, i decided which char that will benefit the most in my team comp, if they had a gp then its a bonus, anw my teams are almost complete so yeah if i dont have that global passive then thats not gonna be the end of the world"
"Yeah, it's not the first game to have something like this. So the ""this might spread to other games"" worry is too late as HSR itself isn't patient 0."
No it works in end game content
"X thing have spark controversy 

Ah of course just an average day in a hoyoverse community of any game

Honestly i never like endgame stuff i just want to enjoy and chill, look at arknight for example game is so hard that i have to use guide everytime a new boss arrived. It's ridiculous tbh."
Global passives are might be new mechanic for all of new characters and Castorice is test for this mechanics... but people refuse to have something new and that's awkward
Imagine 3 years later with no other character having global thing and ppl still complain about castorice. Its just a guess
not a problem as i already decided to pull before the livesteam
"Y'all have to stop complaining about characters having this, characters being that, enemies whatever, and instead wonder if this game is even fun to begin with."
Barbara in genshin impact has the same ability just that she has to be in the team to for the revive ability to work 🧐
"Bro SHES not a “must have character” like they are pretty good units if u have the following:
Firefly
Feixiao
Acheron
Rappa
Boothill
Aglea
The HERTA
Jing yuan (who is still pretty good)
Seele (im joking)
Silver wolf (SHES getting buffed)
And THATS it and if u don’t like have these characters then build them and u can still clear all content;) (with good teams of course)"
I'm skipping her though.
"Just because castorice has global passive doesn't mean shes a must pull i really hate this narrative of people just because this character has a broken ability means u have to get her, this global passive appeared and then suddenly people cares about the meta of HSR like bro what?

like heck im skipping castorice for my boy Phainon because i like his character and also people calling pay2win its dumb u playing gacha game of course there will be pay2win aspect i swear people are just dumb."
"These are gotcha games. They only care about making money 😂

People will boycott by going to another gotcha game to feed their lust filled gambling addiction 😂"
"You’re not really forced to get her. It’s a great help sure but if you you’re forced to get her you’re absolutely wrong since we’ve been 2 years without this mechanic in the game and everyone can beat endgame modes just by investing in your dps and supports, just do the same if you don’t want to wish for casteroise"
"cough bailu. cough and who tf gives a crap about it still working without her in the party just be happy that a free +1 life is available, it sounds like a super premium feature, so let the super premium feature be a feature you work hard to get (grinding for jades) or buy it outright? It’s such a sad thing to be complaining about, power creeps are real, they exist, they aren’t gonna stop. It’s stupid to make every character responsibly similarly powerful. No one would pay for new characters = less income to HoYoverse = worse/slower updates. God damn it the games are FREE, you A) do not have to complete everything, B) you do not have to pay for everything C) it is a free to play game with purchasable items for people who worked for the money to pay for it. We f2p players work in game to afford our characters, others work in real life to afford their characters. It’s simple people. Just quit bitching and be grateful that you have a new character releasing that does something new, would you be excited about a new character if they did nothing new/no boosts? No, you’d only pull for design/lore wise and from how many times I’ve seen players admit to skipping important dialogue gives me the impression not many people care about the lore or personality of characters. So like. No, who cares. It’s a game, you don’t need to spend money on it. If you’re that upset about castorice then just save for her and get her, no need to build apparently considering the entire roster boost buff she gives."
"One way to make this better is to remove it from her kit, and add global passives in the game via the story or special challenges that you can do to unlock them,imo."
"The passive is literally: Revive for 1 turn. If get healed, you're good. If not, the characters go back to dying"
You really don't need her to be honest
So of hoyo ever adds a character that canonically can steal money from peoples bank account does that mean they'll be able to tske money from your actual bsnk account? Wouldn't that be s thing huh
"The passive works even if she's not on the team???? WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? If I pull her and leave her in my inventory, I'd still get her buffs??? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔"
"Working outside of combat seems scummy but at the same time who cares. The game doesn't balance around new characters so its the same endgame wether you have her or not.
Also lore accuracy is alot more valuable because it promotes suspension of disbelief, which is the most important thing Hoyo games should all have."
"I'm guarantee,so..yeah 🤣"
"Next comes the authority of dmgbonus, who gives bonus dmg even when not in the battle. Next up are authority of respen boost and defignore boost, don't worry tho, they are just lore accurate (still means you have to get them)"
"maybe you should read the boss mechanics then, which is part and parcel of a strategy-focused tower defense game? 

arknights is not difficult (the overall floor of difficulity of the game hasn't changed much since day 1 of release) its just a puzzle you need to solve, and unlike hsr, doesn't shill their new characters with the new bosses/events. 

AK veterans actually blindly brute force most content in the game except their roguelike mode, the only reason they use guides is to play the stage the lazy/AFK way, not because they cannot clear the stage itself."
"Plus, Cast might eventually be added to the new shop in 5.0 or as an option in the limited 50/50 loss pool."
"Shes not a must pull, but her global passive kind of makes her a must pull if you want to do decently in moc or apoc shadow, which is why many people are annoyes 😭"
"I'm sorry but this is probably the most ignorant and arrogant take I have seen in a long time. You make out people only care about the meta now like are you blind? People have been complaining about the meta since jingliu came out cause of the gross power creep and then since post sparkle everyone has been complaining about how powercreep was getting out of hand and then when firefly came out and break became the dominant meta by design people were not happy. And you I like how you picked and chose what people have said to fit your own narrative about the global passives cause here is the thing. Yes it is a broken ability and unfair to just have an auto revive just for existing and not being in the team as it should have been. Cause like people have said if this is the future it's only gonna get worse since all these abilities will stack and how long till we get atk, crit, sod auto healing, boosts? And on top of that with how power creep is in this game Im sure shes now a top meta unit so now it's just a gross win win situation and sets a bad slate for the future.

And your last point is probably one of the worst overused poorly thought out excuses there is cause there are a lot of gacha games which aren't P2W the problem and yes there are always aspects in games the problem here is it's being pushed in your face and the implementation so really you call people dumb but in actuality you are probably the dumb one here cause of how pig headed you are. And if you want an easy example let's look at hoyos 2 other releases genshin and zzz notice how very few people complain about the power scaling but in this game it's prominently talked about? So really I think it's best you do some basic research and have an actual idea of what you are talking about before you look like a fool and if you are just gonna come back with I think this and I have no problem with this there for I am right just don't even reply"
" @Hotaru_ko  no You do not need every busted characters to DECENTLY clear the end game. You just need a not too old team and give your characters a good relics + leveling. Cas will be a top meta char not because the global passive, but the damage she can do."
"It’s still a global passive, and a single revive can do a lot. Not to mention hoyo will balance future content around this passive, hurting players who didn’t get her even more"
"⁠ @NoobTheNewt0987  but even so they already stated they’ll buff old units so it won’t be much of a problem if they keep buffing old units, which are old but still useable if built right and with the right team, plus their is no garantuee that all future content around this passive so it’s still not much of a big deal"
"​ @willy_247 okay you are really missing the point of why people are not happy. Cause think of it like this. People have been complaining a lot recently about how powercreep happening every other week is getting out of hand, the hp inflation in end game modes are getting way too bloated, by adding these global passives that means difficulty will only get worse and we know they are gonna add new passives and old units getting buffs is just no it's not gonna fix anything like congratulations you went from a 2/10 to a 4/10 and you say right builds and teams that's easier said then done cause 95% of people do not get relics the hand of god has. And no guarantee? Haven't you been focusing on the meta when they decided let's make break units the big thing everything was centered around break. The hp inflation is cause of the new units. So it is guaranteed they will make content around this and it's a grim outlook for the future"
"If she’s a “must have character” then get her, save who you’re saving for for later, if she’s must have then the answer is obvious. It’s easy to get her, shit I’m about to pull a guaranteed Mydei 31 and hoping his light cone too and will likely be able to castorice before her banner ends and I’m f2p, spent money twice last year to get 2 30 day passes. Didn’t even collect most of them. Since late 3.0 I have made around 250 wishes (will edit with an exact number once I check.) but damn, are yall sure Amphoreus isn’t based on America

Cuz the fans of amphorius basics are so much better than the rest of the . Like simple chain of demand"
Sike!! It's still Hoolay's turn.
" @anoshthatplayminecraft1896  and they call that OP? Not even the fact that she can summon a dragon who looks like it can shred any boss, yeh they have more than one screw loose"
"​@Im_Motivated-Ayato  you're not seeing the bigger picture that LITERALLY everyone else is talking about, lol. How????"
"​ @kotoriminalinsky4928  erm so? Thats a what If. What, are they gonna make a character with a passuve that reduces all enemies hp that enter by 99%? Or a global passive that makes all your character's first turn gurantee a crit on all their hits?"
" @kotoriminalinsky4928  Is the ""bigger picture"" that you are talking about are the ""what ifs"" ? Cuz it's being narrow minded and paranoid."
 @notme8652  isn't that just some curios in the sim uni? The parchment that always eat? 😂
"@xeenooo  It's not narrow-minded or paranoid if it's the natural progression of things, lol. 

It's like the characters themselves. They get ""better"" and more ""broken"" over time. Do you really believe that Hoyoverse is gonna stop the global passives on Castorice? Because that's actually pretty dumb. The global passives will only get ""better"" and more ""broken"" over time."
"@notme8652  The best part is that we don't know. But just like we get incredibly broken characters, we can only assume that the same thing will happen. Crit rate, crit damage, exta hp, etc. 

But not only is that the point, but eventually, people are going to be pulling FOR the global passives. Idk if I have to point it out, but that's BAD for the players, GOOD for the billionaire company. It's not uncommon for companies to test the boundaries of their consumers to see how much they can get away with. It happens all the time."
 @kotoriminalinsky4928  we already have buffs for that._.
@kotoriminalinsky4928  explain why bonus stats are bad for players.
"@xeenooo  I can see why you think it's good, but it's making the game even more pay to win. We already have HP inflation happening. In the future, when you're pulling for characters JUST for their global passives, that's not good. You're just falling for their sleazy money grabbing tactics 😭 People like you are the perfect targets for greedy companies."
 @kotoriminalinsky4928  I'm F2P so I don't know what predatory thing are they doing. Global passives do not make me spend money on them. Whether it was a bonuse crit rate or crit damage it doesn't make me spend my money on them. So I don't really get when people say that they're getting more predatory and greedy.
 @kotoriminalinsky4928  Yeah since they add a global passive it's possible they will add more. So what is so bad about that ? You will feel obligated to pull for character since they give you extra crit ? Because you will miss out if you didn't pull for them ? Do you pull for every character they release ?
"@xeenooo  I understand what you mean. I'm also F2P, I got back into the game recently. But their tactics definitely work considering that they're consistently at the top of gacha games when it comes to making money. The purpose of gacha games is to get players to spend money (ie. LIMITED banners). Just because you and I don't spend on the game doesn't mean that others also don't. 

I'm just saying that because people continuously put up with their bad behavior or be passive about it, it just makes the game worse. Side note, but relevant, It's why we don't get good QOL updates because people aren't very vocal about it and continue giving their money to this game, lol."
@kotoriminalinsky4928  yeah majority of the players makes the game worse. Also is 300 TP a bad QoL ? Are treasure gadgets bad ? It's only you loud minority thinking that if we don't have this something that other games had = bad QoL.
"@xeenooo  Man. There's no point in talking with you if this is genuinely how you think...

I will give you credit where it's due though, HSR QoL isn't as bad as Genshin's."
 @xeenooo  Just stop talking to this paranoid person. Im f2p too and I can't bother givin a crap about the passive. It's literally have a big UNIQUE on  it's stat screen. That makes me question at what point do things stop being unique to a character
"​​ @xeenooo because it is locked behind a literal paywall tf you mean?

Each update only gives you enough pulls for a near chance to get a 5 star via soft pity and then you need to contend with the 50/50


This passive and future ones is not garunteed and you know it isnt.

It is bad for the consumer you nimwit, the billion dollar company with a gambling mechanic just roped you in again with another incentive to keep pulling and inticing you to cave in to spend money.

If this passive was:

A: only active when castorice is on the team

Or

B: applied to the main character or a standard banner unit

This would be fine

It is not about the ""revive being op and unfair"" this is a game where you spam your buttons and defeat the moc enemy without breaking a sweat. ""Dying"" has never been an issue in this game and its not about that

Lets put this into irl terms for you because let me remind you a gacha game is factually gambling

If you go play at the casino and go their brand new slot machine that lets you get an additional bonus for pulling a certain limited time value that gives you better chances at winning, what do you think is happening here? 

The answer is obvious, the house is enticing you to keep pulling the slots until you get that value because otherwise you lose out its limited time after all and it benefits you forever! 

Anyone with a brain will say thats predatory. It is not good for the consumer, it gives the illusion that it is good for you but all it does at the end of the day is line more of your money into the houses pockets.

But no, add a anime waifu and some mind numbing gameplay with ""sick animations"" and suddenly its no longer predatory right? Even though both the limited time character passive (because the character is limited time) and limited time special value mechanically serve the same purpose

Every gacha is inheriently predatory whether you like or not and if you are free to play it doesnt fucking matter. A casino that lets you play for free limited time is still a fucking casino

I like playing gacha games just like how i like playing normal games. At no point should any player start defending the developers from trying to squeeze more money from their community.

Look at any gacha cc, look at how everyone hates lootboxes (a western gacha mechanic), look at any offical opinion, look at any law document chinese, american, or otherwise

The consensus is clear to see. Gacha is gambling and gambling is inherinently predatory.

Even the time you spend is a currency thats why you are able to play for free you are paying with your time"
Yes
"uh no, the game does balance itself around the new characters for both story and endgame (this is beyond the scope of global passives btw) which is why powercreep discussions/controversy is such a serious issue in hsr. it makes powercreep discussions in other games like arknights look like a joke in comparison. I can guarantee if hsr stops excessive shilling of new characters and funnels all the hp inflation to a new moc13-15 or apoc/pf 5 that doesn't provide any jades(just miscel rewards), 80% of powercreep complaints will dissolve immediately."
"​ @Dchy23  ""beyond the scope"" meaning global passive isnt included?
in any case if this is a similar case to Genshin where the Abyss Syzygy/Imaginarium Theatre buff works in parallel with the current banners, it doesnt mean the abyss/theatre is impossible to complete without it. it looks like the ceiling is lowered if you pull but even without pulling youre not locked out of anything unfairly.
if you play the game regularly you can pull regularly. that's what the buffs are balanced around. just because the banner matches the effect doesnt mean your only option is to pay, and i bet most paying players couldnt care less about the endgame effect cycles. if you play the game normally you can still play around those effects, you can still clear the endgame challenges without them, and you arent guaranteed to do any better even if you did get the character. the only thing ""predatory"" is the limited resin reserves and the fact that youd have to pay for extra. this might give someone trouble in building the characters that fit the effect niche.
if matching new characters to fit certain gameplay effects isn't the case, (and i assumed it was at least similar because Hoyo mechanics are somewhat universal, especially between HSR and GSI,) I dont get how they would even begin to make the endgame revolve around one specific character's ability with each iteration of said endgame, cause thats never been the case."
Is it weird that I'm the only one not complaining or...
"Im not really sure i see much of an issue with this to be honest since it does only happen once per battle, plus it is onlt to make it Easier, its not mandatory, plus in the same patch we can choose to get a free healer at the same time, meaning that even if even if someone chooses to not get Castorice you still get a healer thats still pretty good. I think thats just because i already have most of the healers in game tho-"
"You don't need it to beat end game contents. It will make it easier, but not mandatory."
Genshin: Absolute Cinema
The Global revive is the slippery slope the Hoyo shills refuse to see 🫩🫩🫩
slap her with luocha and its ggs endgame not fun anymore
"I mean, the lore reasoning is obviously why they have that feature, but they could've easily chosen a different one, like every member surviving a deadly hit once per battle or something. Maybe that's a ""P2W"" for some as well, but I think it's a lot less so from a gameplay aspect and less cheaty towards Death."
"If you support this, you are part of the problem. It should be limited to having her on the team. It doesn't need to be a global passive to ""fit her lore"" as if that's even a reason in the first place. It is innovative, sure, but in a bad way. Having this global passive sets a bad precedence for future characters, especially when there's already evidence found of there being more characters that will have global passives."
I think they really want money
"Are you along with these people mentally rtarded. It would've been one thing if it was when she was in team, making it global means it'll universally nerf your acc if you don't want to pull her. You can't just bypass her team"
"I get that it can be lore accurate as but just don't make it global.

If so, then Firefly should join the fight as a fifth party member if the trailblazer is on the team."
imagine calling something p2w in a game that you can clear f2p :O people are really getting digusting.... also a game with no pvp :P
So what's next? Zenless zone zero?
"The problem isn't the passive it's self it's the precedent, though i don't get why power creep it so much? If just having a dps bailu for the whole team while she's in it not enough? It NEEDS  to be even while out of party? Not to mention the what this may do for enemy power creep. And I'm a pretty big dolphin at this point so I've git skin in the game. Genuinely design wise it's bad to make it this busted. This is like a year 5-7 level ability a game puts in not like what year 2 for star rail?"
Omg you have to roll for a character in a gacha game😮😮😮😮
I think they are just someone who can't enjoy anything in life
Meanwhile i just wanna enjoy the story content
Difference in opinion between western and CN is pretty big. It is what it is i guess
This will only help Either whale who suck at the game (which come on really)  or f2p players who really need a revive to get through MOC lmao I can’t see the pwoercreep lol
Bro.... We literally need that if the MOC is beating our asses this bad 💀
"hoyo does have a very strong preference to cater to whales and new f2ps, which is their primary demographic of target for almost all their business practices (including this global passive). the only problem is they have no qualms of fucking everyone else in the middle (veteran f2ps and small spenders) to do that even if they don't have to; which I believe is the primary criticism most ppl have for hoyo. the ""powercreep"" lies in the inclusion of global passives as precedent for hp inflation (which is alr bad even without it)"
And that tactic is called the company selling you the solution.
"That reason they said she is the authority of death that's why she had that global passive is a good excuse (not like I support it) as long as castorice will be the only character in the entire game who has a global passive bc if they add some unit who have a global passive, I'm done with mihoyo's excuses"
Crazy that castorice is more seele than seele lol
Using lore accurate as an excuse is stupid. By that logic hoyo can give any character a broken global ability like allow you to know have 5 characters per team and people won’t complain as there’s a lore reason for it.
I can only imagine her passive being useful only in endgame content unless your a new player and you think  her passive is op when it’s really mid then you just suck at the game
Who cares about power creep in a single-player game ?
"For what this sets for the future of HSR is indeed a bit concerning yes but as soon as I see global passives that buff overall dmg, spd, crit etc then it becomes a WHOLE another can of worms.."
Can’t wait for all the comment that completely miss the point of the complaints and think people are “complaining for no reason.”
"It’s bad. Plain and simple. Hopefully it’s an extremely rare occurrence and should it ever appear again, it’s not something busted like boosting crit rate, crit damage, damage reduction etc."
The Fall of HSR is near
"If the revive only worked when she is on the team it wouldn't have been a issue and the ability would have still been lore accurate.
But giving revive just by existing on your account is not good.
I can see a potential boss coming up who don't 1 shot you once but twice which will make her revive useless and a new character will have double revive passive on them 💀"
"If hoyo can SOMEHOW not be greedier than all sin and make Castorice the only character with a global passive, it shouldn't be a huge issue. But we all know that is not how this is going to go. This game speed ran it's fall off wtf."
"next up character gonna boost up your team without present at team

i can smell it the strategy"
"i mean, bailu also revives after death once a battle???"
"well just dont die as always,"
It is really a amazing and cool new feature though I dunno why they hate it well if you can't get her on the first run just wait for the rerun I skipped Mydei for her too
"I personally think that its a cool mechanic that fits her character, but it definitely sets a new bar for even more future powercreep."
Yall complain about everything at this point
"In a game where enemies constantly have higher HP, these buff skills can help players win more easily, especially for newbies"
They should add a switch for this ability so player can turn on and off anytime they want.
"One think that I still can't get over with these fucking idiots is that it ""forces"" them to pull her, like my guy, you can choose to pull for her or not. If you need her global passive then go ahead, if you don't need it then skip her, its not like hoyo is holding you at gunpoint"
What character would make you have a 5 members team based on lore that would make sense? xD
​ @felipeabreu4866  Hoyo wrote the lore themselves and designed the units themselves. There is no limit to how bullshit these passives can get...
 @felipeabreu4866  Idk they haven’t made one yet that’s the point. They can make a new character with some lore and then give them some op global passive and call it lore accurate. Duh
It’s about older units not being able to keep up with new ones. This still applies in multiplayer and single player games.
Wait until it's Phainon releasing with some busted global passive and they don't want to pull the yucky male character. It'll be glorious 🤣
"To be fair, it's a ""put the cart before the horses"" type of situation no matter how you look at it.

People are mad about something that didn't happen yet, but it might happen...one day."
"​ @felipeabreu4866  Yea just like others said this complaining is just ""what if"""
 @felipeabreu4866 why would you wait for thing to happen before you start complain at that point it cannot be reverse.
"​ @nuram_ai DONT YOU INSULT MY BOY, anyways he will gives atk buff (thankfully not the double lightcone one BUT if its really the double lightcoen) and Cyrene will gives hp and SPD buff (thank God not 5 teammate). If you want an explanation to the old leaks just ask"
You'll not die if you don't finish le last MOC stage 🤡🤡🤡🤡. So yes stop complain for no REASON
 @teddyakakpovi3368 and you just proved their point lmaooo 😭🙏
"​@pine_c0ne.com1the only point he proved is y'all complain too much, and those who complained better not even think of pulling her when her banner drops. If you want to prove a point then do it better, boycott the game by not playing , not just by simply not spending money on the game"
I'm just finding it funny people are complaining about pay to win in a gatcha. As if power creep isn't a thing to promote spending...
"it's a ""what if"" situation. I'm not complaining about anything until I see what happens"
"​ @DemoMan465  I'm also finding it funny that Hoyoshills are defending it. We've got plenty of gachas out there, some handle it better than the others. Hoyoverse, unfortunately, is not of that kind"
"​@wonderingstxrs i mean, its better to complain about something that looks like its about to happen (idk apparentely theres leaks of other global passives coming out in like 2 patchws) than to wait until you cant do anything about it anymore..."
"Cry and whining the ultimatum level, are you not tired of yourself?"
"​@adriantepes4355 idk i feel like all gatcha do this. Where the newer characters are better. I feel this is no difference then Robin or Acheron being ""must pulls"" because of how good they were at release."
"​@justasleepyfool  but then you're just nit enjoying the game. id rather not sour my experience by constantly worrying and complaining about passives that arent even in the game yet. and its not like a bunch of passives will make me quit the game either so whats the point? i play this game cause i like the characters and lore, not for the meta."
"@Shreggy  oh I'm not, believe me he's the only 3.x char I really REALLY want. But it's just gonna be funny when the people defending Castorice global passive get upset a less popular character gets a useful global buff. The chaos will be hilarious."
"You'd be surprised of how much people who actually just ""complains for no reason"" And just jumping into the band wagon. Sure, it could be unhealthy for the game and understand that some people will have strong opinions on the matter (trust me, I play priconne and this kinda global buff is really annoying to play around). But the random asshole who just complains about stuff and doesn't know when to shut up or where to shut up are the worst. Please complain all you want but do not bring it up to your minor circle who are just trying to enjoy the game"
"@wonderingstxrs  i mean yeah, you do you, if you enjoy it, go on. I already quit the game so i dont really know why im still talking about it lol, i hope you continue to enjoy the game."
"the people not complaining are the same people that have Aventurine and tell others that don't have him that they just need to ""learn to play"" when they get one shot by a boss."
"​@wonderingstxrs Lol, wait till they use china law (that prohibit them from nerfing characters) against you."
​ @Shreggy  I love the fanfic passives people are making! It's peak entertainment. I am however somewhat concerned for the people that think it's legit.
" @aliceblack3533  heck yeah, because of that some people were twisted between the real leak and the fanfic one. Anyway if there's a healing global passive would it be fun? Just my idea"
" @Shreggy   I've seen someone else suggest we could use a 5th character as a support, similar to Dan Heng vs Phantylia/other boss fights. Having 5 members in the stellaron hunter fight was really fun as well. 

Maybe not a global passive, but I think being able to use a 5th character as a support that either lets you use their ultimate or give your team a unique buff would be pretty cool. Whether it's our own character or a friend's character."
"​ @DemoMan465 you say pay to win to pve game  , mode that optional , and passive that basicly useless is your building chara properly ."
"​ @adriantepes4355 than just play another gacha lol , you can gamble to another game 😂"
"​@thfz77 i say pay to win because handing over money to win at a game is pay to win. Crazy right? Almost like the context doesn't matter, since what i described it as is accurate."
" @aliceblack3533  yeah that would be fun ngl, if there's an event like that I can't wait to play it"
"is a game buddy, go touch some grass"
 @nuram_ai  yep still gonna skip😂
"Oh I've seen people argue ""well they give Luocha/RM for free so what's your problem?""

Gacha players are galactic level stupid"
"the passive is broken and its a thing about future characters, seele can dodge and slice bullets but we see nothing lore wise made into gameplay"
​ @teddyakakpovi3368  queue hoyoshills defending a billion dollar company.
"dude, it's a gacha game ofc it's pay to win"
"​ @teddyakakpovi3368  ah yes its fine to not finish end game content reason....its also fine to not pull,its also fine to not do daily,its even fkin fine if you dont play the game at all 😂"
 @markus_danger  hoyoshill spotted
 @thelordofanime6150  Exactlyyy!!!
"I Will complain when the Game introduces a pvp mode. Otherwise I honestly just SEE this as a bunch of meta chasers getting mad. Oh, and the usual spice of haters with Zero stakes, like tectone and gacha snack."
@ hoyohater detected
 @markus_danger  yep it's natural to hate a greedy gacha company but it's really sad to shill for one.
"​ @aeririahelmold that's what happens if you get addicted to gambling, it happens and they harm anything that lives who hates or hurt their precious billion dollar gambling company, which it already happens and it's getting extremely worse and worse and hoyoshills are turning a blind eye on them."
Cmiiw but her global passive doesn't work in MOC iirc?
"​ @DemoMan465  well, if it's paced they would still got revenue from rerun. For example, how many of players that skip the ones they love in rerun when they know more powerful characters incoming? I do hope the buffing old characters would make pulling for rerun worth it instead of punished for doing so"
" @aeririahelmold  If you hate this greedy corporation, why are you even discussing it and not leaving gacha games? It's not about protection, it's about players losing the boundaries of what they should really be afraid of"
All of the comments on this guy's videos are just glazing devs. Like I wish we could still like a game but be critical about it when it does something not-so great.
" @markus_danger  so you think just cause I don't like them I can't talk about them, What sense does that make? I just think it's funny to see people defending companies that don't love them."
Yeah why is everyone complaining about something that is leading up to defeating the purpose of a turn based strategy game in a turn based strategy game? I don't get it! XD
They are though.
"And hoyo still make millions in every patch, nothing to worry😂"
" @Kyaaa- then that’s even worse, because they’ll get away with treating their playerbase like illiterate garbage knowing that those suckers would pay every single cent for a character who’s global passive allows for increased crit in the future"
" @NoobTheNewt0987  how can hoyo give us 10 free pulls in every patch consider as ""they treat us literally like garbage""? also they give us FREE 30 PULLS plus FREE limited 5* character (Luocha or Ruan Mei) in 3.2 but still considered as garbage lol that's funny😂 about those suckers u mention it's their problem tho since they use their own money nothing wrong with that and global passive characters are not a must pull btw"
​ @NoobTheNewt0987 you'll still play anyway
 @Kyaaa-  The fact that stuff like this is considered generous enough to defend hoyo makes me sad as an onlooker
" @jetkirby3981  I can't imagine if FREE 30 pulls and FREE limited 5* character still wasn't consider generous enough, people really are greedy tho😂 maybe if Hoyo gives free 90 pulls🥴 and can choose any free 5* characters in every patch, people will say Hoyo is generous lol"
 @Kyaaa-  How about more things to do in the base game to get pulls
 @jetkirby3981  just do the events and story mission u will get enough jades to pulls btw
Global passive is really powerful effect which you only need her to be existing on your account either you need to fully build her or leave her on Lvl 1. I would be really jealous cause i planning to get Castorice on her rerun. Her revive passive should have only when she is on team. I really love castorice as she remind me of Griseo. I really wanna get her but I'm saving for Hyacine.
The only sane concern I've read to date about this topic.
"I got already onshot by the New Boss before her passive was known though... 

The real issue is, enemies will become harder and harder as long as people can 0 cycle stuff...

I rather see castorice as an offer to weaker players to maybe offset their subpar relics even after months of farming..."
How? The only we can do that is we must have Castorice. Yep Pay to Play.
"Okay.. Because you said that suit her lore, then make Acheron or Herta who literally an Emanator have the global passive...."
"​@muhammadhanry7907  dude, Acheron literally already one shots  with her technique, and Herta doesnt have any lore specific abilities besides being smart."
" @idk_anymore_01  woah nothing new here, I havent seen power creep happen before, thats crazy its almost like the company is made a character just for people to pull on or else they wont have any revenue, yep definitely never happened to any other gacha games out there."
​ @Im_Motivated-Ayato  no shit dumbass. I'm just saying that they've come up with an easy and NEW potential way to do it now.
"​@Im_Motivated-Ayato  yeah, well no sh1t. I'm just saying that they've found a potential and easy new way to powercreep now."
"​@Im_Motivated-Ayato everybody knows that powecreep is unavoidable, but it has potential to be even worse."
 @idk_anymore_01 Herta decimates acheron lore wise?
​ @idk_anymore_01 You know nothing about Herta?
Only if she have that as normal passive not global
Honestly if they want lore accuracy they could have just made it into a story unlockable global passive. Something like after to her moment in her story she blesses us with something and it helps us in our future troubles. Making it so that the passive only activates when you have her in your account it's just greed
 @littleswansplaygrownd6817  TRUE. a free system for all players would be an amazing addition. i don't understand how people are defending this sh
Who the f**k don't want to complain with special ability behind paywall?
"But that's the thing, hsr is selling you the solution to the problem they made themselves. After a while, people won't even consider summoning for characters that don't have a global passive, and that will damage the game"
" @IshimurA99  I love HSR, but as a game, it doesn’t require ‘skill’ like genshin and ZZZ where you’re running around causing reaction and assists and all that."
Nothing is pay to win or a must have when it’s all solely just for the singular player convenience if they want it or not.
"Idrc, so long as I have it (and I will I have guaranteed) idc, if future characters have it so be it, I’ll benefit from the global passive even if other ppl don’t, its a PVE game anyways"
Ill keep playing because I like the game and its challenging but im not pulling for any characters with global passives ill let those rot
"So...I hope there is a Disable toggle for the passive OR in certain content there is a spell field that disables that passive. I swear they about to release Challenge mode ++ where the Boss Kill your first 3 characters forcing you to put a healer in 4th slot to revive the rest of your characters and if you don't have Castorice, RIP your 3 characters.... And it will absolutely Brick any Guide makers and Recomended Team comps Team Comps Imagine a Comp Only works with Castorice passive and without it it won't work..."
Everyone should be pulling anyway regardless of the kit. There's a literal dragon.
just pull for her lmao cuz u get tons of pulls for her
"sure, P2W in a non PvP game 🙄
people are just overreacting"
I just ignoring them because they are full of drama
"Ppl really didn't get it, yes it revive the character but on 1hp that means if you don't have heal right away you're fucked either way"
"If players support this 
Hoyo gonna us this opportunity to milk more money yeah this game become shitty as F"
If they nerf it to where it’s only if she’s in the party it’s a great ability that works wonderfully with her lore!
All that matters is what CN thinks. Hoyo doesn't give a fuck about what we want in the US. So if CN likes this then it's going to happen. And honestly CN is such a brainwashed community of gamers that they happily eat and swallow shit on a constant basis.
"Honestly, I think some people are like kids who crave candy. If they get candy, they take it for granted, but if they don’t, they blame you for not listening to their request 😮‍💨"
"Yeah  If you guys don't like it, send feedback about it. 
Don't say ""useless"" and equate other Devs 

Giving lots of criticism is very good, but don't take hate as criticism, that's different. 

I remind you, spreading hate will add to problems, not solve them

Tbh  I also don't like ""that global thing"", because of that. 
Tbf If anything is unclear, please correct me. 😅"
"Bruh, Castorice revive is just insurance. To be clear it doesn't help you better when you play in any mode, characters after resurrecting they can still die next turn if not healed or shielded afterwards. So sustain still has an irreplaceable role."
"If some people really see this as an ok feature, what will become of hsr if they add more global passives??"
"If you don't like it, just don't pull her. It's not a must, it's a choice. For me, that was just lore wise passive. Many people want lore wise character, they made one and players still fxxking complain. If you think it a must have, you're just dont like to play hardly  as other player that seriously without even getting meta characters. 
You build whatever you want and pay/pull for whatever you want. Just shut the fxxx up, toxic. 
If you don't want to pay to get her/support hoyoverse، you're just someone that same as feminist that want equal rights even though work lazier. Equal right only for peoples that do equal things not for fxxxing people that always complain."
"Well yeah if the revive was not global, its still pretty good. But the fact that even you bench castorice and you just have her in your inventory makes it op just waiting to activate the passive"
"I find it weird that people think this forces you to pull for her. No, it doesn't. As an f2p, you will be perfectly fine if you don't have this global passive (which isn’t even good tbh). If you genuinely feel forced, then that means you're either terrible at building your characters and can't clear anything, or you just have a gambling addiction.
Maybe this does set a precedent for global passives, yes, but until we see what another one looks like, I'm not complaining at all."
acheron also makes endgame content easier by skipping the battle and instantly kills enemies. yet no one seems to complain about it since her debut.
"Usually I would agree but gacha games are a special case.

Since they are live service games that constantly get content updates this can easily spiral into ""you can't even clear the main story without broken character anymore"" 

then, yes, it would be p2w

Obviously the chance of that happening is pretty low, but never say never. Hoyo isn't very good at balancing and they already had to nerf 2 main story bosses in the past because casuals couldn't clear them"
@ My account was pure ass up till Feixaio so I question how people had trouble beating the Adventurine and Sunday boss fight when I could no problem lol. (Don’t remember if Sunday was one of the bosses that got nerfed)
"@ idk, I never fought them pre-nerf

Fact is the bosses were too hard for a lot of people, or else Hoyo wouldn't have nerfed them. There's a lot of factors playing into the difficulty. Sunday was immidiately 50x easier when you had Aventurine on your team, for example

Idk what counts as ""account being pure ass"" for you"
Thats the thing She is a cool and unique character so everyone should pull her the passive is the added bonus to her kit and someone who is not pulling  is just dumb and missing out big time
 @BibekDas-yy7mg  gotta be the most shill comment I’ve ever seen. So you’re saying we can no longer pull on who we want. We HAVE to pull castorice or else suffer for having free will
Agreed
Pay to Play
"not trying to be mean or toxic here, genuine question. are you really blind to the real reason ppl are complaining?"
This is honestly what most people want.
"They won’t, test servers are closed."
Would also make her 1 of 3 characters who do that
"​ @ImprovmanZero Bailu, her, and who else?"
Probably e2 fuxuan
 @GustavoJua15  whatever Otto is calling himself
" @GustavoJua15  It's Huo Huo. At a certain Eidolon (2), she gains a revive that can be used twice per battle."
This is what im thinking too
stop fucking saying the same damn thing
​ @Ceereal467  Fuxuan E2 also revives teammates
..so it’s literally just Bailu then? Yeah no thanks
"Unfortunately, they can't nerf her anymore because they would get sued in China. That bridge has been crossed."
 @user-sm3kh2bp2h  I think you mean fortunately
That's just a passive then
"​@British.Raiden.Shogun 
You have to heal the character that is revived with her passive iirc because they just die again once the passive runs out"
"@British.Raiden.Shogun  
Idk if you meant to tag me but, I didn't say anything about it being strong.

In fact, you could probably infer I think it isn't super powerful from the fact that it's a revive with an extra step"
... that's what fu xuan has...
"​ @British.Raiden.Shogun   it's not because of the revive, a lot of people think it's because of her having a global passive that Hoyo will use more and more in the future and using that as a new selling point for characters, power creeping old characters and making you feel stupid for pulling for old characters and forcing you to pull new characters again cause characters with global passives is the new meta"
 @British.Raiden.Shogun  actually it isn't imagine this alright : you take a 3 month break from hsr and you come back but issue is that the pervious banner characters give global passives to which you need to clear X content since without it the content is impossible it FORCES you to pull cause you will always be at a disadvantage compared to everyone who DID pull for the global
 @naxmaxJK So most people that don't want to pull her wants this global passive removed? No one wants their characters weaker if they gonna pull them. In the end it's a mostly single player game so balance isn't really that important.
@British.Raiden.Shogun  mean atp they should do that if they decide to keep the global trend cause then it would make it 100% pay to win and not f2p friendly
"@British.Raiden.Shogun  also I don't think I would have an issue with it being only a team, but I have an issue when it's global cause it doesn't make sense since why does it have to be global? There is no reason to make an impactful gameplay design to which hurts the overall experience for everyone"
"​ @British.Raiden.Shogun see the problem is, how many runs didn't you see that it took? How much investment is in each of those characters that's where this all lays and how string does a character need to be to be relevant. Does a character NEED a passive so strong it's global at this point in the game? No let's be honest"
"​ @British.Raiden.Shogun the problem isn't the revival it's the precedence it sets for global passives, what's stopping a character from having a passive global 5%damage up for your team for the whole fight?"
"​ @dahaoren1812  dude, people are obviously concerned with the fact there are GLOBAL passives in the first place because what's stopping another CHARACTER from having one that's actually gonna cause a ridiculous power spike. For EXAMPLE  5-15% attack up for your whole team for the whole battle. Or better yet you get 5 energy regen every turn for everybody. Maybe a maximum health boost all the time. Are you seeing the bigger picture here? This is like a year 5-7 gatcha game ability thrown in at like year what 2 or 3?"
"@ I don't think global passives will be designed to be that powerful like giving 15% attack. Even if it will give some buff it will probably be not as huge and there will probably be some limitations if there are way too many global passives(for example only one global passives can be selected per team or something similar). This rez for example, I rarely die in even the hardest content, it's really not that useful and won't hurt if you don't have it. If the developers don't put any limitations on that I don't think anyone will be happy. I don't think they are that stupid to ruin their game completely. I'm not that concerned about this. 

Disclaimer: I'm just saying this is what my thoughts and expectations are, not saying I'm going to be correct."
 @dahaoren1812   but do you. Honestly think it'll have a one global active at a time effect? Restraint in the first place would be them restricting this effect to just while she's on the team. And even if it doesn't what's stopping this from becoming something like future characters on field ability to be permanent to the team is slots and not the characters so you can essentially always have their ability trigger while not having them on the team. This just feels like a slippery slope for no real benefit especially cause people always complained about MOC so now the question of scaling comes up and that's a whole nother can of worms cause if you make more than one global and multiple can be active how do you balance it for the haves and have nots.
@ It's a gacha game you just don't balance it
true i also thought of it like that at first but a passive that works even shes not in a team is just blatant pay2win
im even okay with this
"Phainon probably will have 20% crit rate global buff considering how strong in lore he is now, and he will be the 2nd character to have global buff since hoyo will make at least 3 global buffer for each new region after this."
And completely shits on the already existing character who had the only revive in the game. Further making older characters garbage. What a win.
Yes! This is much better than the global passive. Still aligned with her lore and wonct just break the game.
"Gacha game not pay to win yeah you wish, gacha game trying to made money from that"
Why would they make it like Bailu? If I were to pull ofc I'd prefer Global buff like this
" @fatestarrail  The global passives are absolutely some of the WORST forms of greed and power creep a gacha game has EVER SEEN.

It is NOT good for the game."
Y’all were gonna pull for either way take the better passive.
"With 1 hp, and dies again if not healed or hit again"
There is literally 0 content that forces you to pull a character. They have the game to where even 4 stars can clear everything relatively easily.
" @danroe3310  LOL NO THEY DO NOT.

You don't have to pull characters, but this character literally requires 0 building to be a game changing character and that is a horrible thing to do to game balance.

Go try and clear the end game MOC with only 4 star heroes. 

Go on. Try it.

Post your results why you are at it. It should be interesting."
"Welt should be one of the strongest, his power is black hole 😂"
​ @British.Raiden.Shogun  I can't help but think that you are the type of person who will agree with whatever the government determines and tell others to back off or leave the country if they don't agree. 😅 😅
" @British.Raiden.Shogun  That's fine, however, most of those who complaining only purely concern about what hoyo is trying to do just to make more money, so they will add something unnecessary just to make people want more, and don't get me wrong, I'm still pulling for castorice regardless, I just can't help but think it's pretty obvious that hoyo knows if they do this, they will get more people to pull for her. Honestly, it doesn't have to be this way"
​​ @British.Raiden.Shogun  if I skip her then I wouldn't get the gp. The gp the char all of this is good. So if those char came out then it will indirectly force me to pull for her. Then what. She gets powercreep. Just like that my money wasted. It's the same as old characters that gets powercreep. It's not her kit(global passive) that everyone hate. It's how this game would turn out if the gp released
​ @British.Raiden.Shogun  give me a link where standard + belobog only char clears the moc then.
 @British.Raiden.Shogun   no link? Yeah I thought so🤣
 @British.Raiden.Shogun  who said I wanna skip.don't u read my comment I really want her kit (gp) so bad. I literally asking Mr. Wallet permission u know. Read again
 @British.Raiden.Shogun   Cmon bro be honest there's literally no video of that and the only thing that you're copying are my words. I feel like I arguing with a kid now
 @British.Raiden.Shogun  where is it. There's nothing in comment section that's for sure. u know how to give links right?🗿
 @British.Raiden.Shogun  I think you're capping🗿. There's literally no link in comment. Try using you're 2nd ACC or smth to check
 @British.Raiden.Shogun  u can give the title because there's no blade videos only seele when I searched (and the video has Sunday in it so no count)
" @British.Raiden.Shogun   no response 🤣. Keep running with your so called ""truth"" lmao. I doubt it even exist🤭"
 @British.Raiden.Shogun   so it's clear now that u don't have the video (cuz u keep avoiding). You're wasting my time u could've told me sooner if u don't have the video😮‍💨. U lost the debate
 @British.Raiden.Shogun  I looked at your channel and saw you post abt u replying to people with dmb comments. Do u enjoy being dmb lol. Also Sunday is a character weirdo🤭
"​ @ImprovmanZero  its not about the revive, it's about the fact that it happens when she's not in your team"
"​ @user-sm3kh2bp2h  yep, only way to fix the balance issue would be to give everyone a free copy which they won't do because she's their big seller for the region. We're well and truly cooked"
"​ @British.Raiden.Shogun  it's the precedent it sets. Now it's a somewhat mid revive ability, but in the future you will have to pull characters to get some flat atk buff or crit buff across all teams for your entire account. What happens when it's a character you don't like and don't want to pull? You will be forced to anyways, or your entire account is some percent weaker than every other players. Even greedy gacha companies that do global buffs don't attach them to limited characters, they're usually in some passive skill tree or something"
@British.Raiden.Shogun  cap 🧢. Give the video and I believe u
" @British.Raiden.Shogun   if u do dmb things anyone would ""drag"" abt it🗿. For exp brag ➡️drag ,anyone would point that out"
 @Sandstimes  Ok that is broken
"Ok… so the OG comment is from my alt and WTF everyone?! YALL CHILL! NONE OF THIS IS THAT DEEP!

 @British.Raiden.Shogun   still no video. Keep capping🧢
 @British.Raiden.Shogun   irrelevant or not dmb still dmb
" @British.Raiden.Shogun  still no video 🗿. The only thing that u're post are your dmb reply and that ""SHOWS A LOT"" lol🤣"

@KaiyaAstral  nah bro. Till he/she shows the link I ain't taking this serious... depends on Ur reply I might think Ur the 2nd acc and pretend to be someone else 🤭
"@ I’m the alt to the original commenter as stated earlier. Plus, I really don’t care if you take the argument seriously. Doesn’t give you a right to be disrespectful."
@KaiyaAstral   if u're truly someone else than read our whole conversation then start replying. If u don't want then don't reply (there'll be no point). Calling people immature are also insult (Ur just do what Ur prohibit me to do🗿)... Nothing personal though👍
@ I’ve read it all. You’re both being ridiculous. It’s a silly game. There’s no need to be getting so aggressive.
@British.Raiden.Shogun  keep capping 🧢
" @KaiyaRichie-s3s  honestly if they want it to be lore, they could have made it so that it's a story unlockable passive that's obtainable by every player. 

Something like after her big moment in the story, she becomes some sort of an eternal ally to the Express and her blessing helps us in our future travels. 

Hell I wouldn't mind being reminded of the belobog folks with their passive"
this is peak hoyoverse players description
But the complaints about her are valid? Stop meat riding multi-million dollar companies that don’t care about you.
"​ @_lluvjuess  the only complaints being valid is that it makes no sense for her ability to apply when she isn't on the team, everything else isn't since:
1- it ain't pay to win since it's single player, just get good if you suck at something 
2- ability it took op just a nice bonus, so calling her ability broken is exaggerated"
have fun when the future chars released that you don't wanna pull for give +10% cdmg global passive. she absolutely can revive and its a good passive that fits her character but why the need for it outside her team? shes not even a healer
"​@livingwarrobots4119  it becomes pay to win when they scale enemy stats to the point that the only logical way to get through the stat sticks is to forgo the sustain and go all-in on damage with risking it all on RNG with an additional turn using the passive for the final stretch -- unlikely to happen, but worst case scenario there is possibility of the situation reaching that point with the power creep where you need that additional investment to keep up

Pay to win isn't a matter of single or multi player at all, it is about whether you can actually clear the content with what you are given for free"
Remembrance can be anything cuz it has no specific role
Tch tch tch. Ignorant Hoyoshill. Do you think that global passive won't be a problem? It WILL be a problem because Hoyo won't even bother about game balance. They only care how much money will make.
" @livingwarrobots4119  her ability is broken, and it opens up the possibility for other characters with similar abilities to be added which would break make it even harder for none meta players. It’s a big issue and people are allowed to complain. You need to understand that people are going yo have opinions and that not everyone is a a yes man that’s going to agree with everything. Characters like Castorice are legit going to ruin the game unless you are pay to win."
"@_lluvjuess  I played war robots to refresh my mind of how mobile games behave, you have every bit to be worried about BUT, to my defense, I forgot how bad they truly are, I played steam and forgot the greed of mobile"
"@ that’s completely fair, I haven’t been playing hoyo games as I’m burnt out from all the grinding, but yeah hoyo is an incredibly greedy company who doesn’t even do the bare minimum with rewards considering they’re a multi-million dollar company. It’s sad to see once again that they’re feeding into ptw and making the meta harder for ftp players."
@_lluvjuess  it's always greed that ruins the nice things
"@ I 100% agree, it’s really sad."

Have you ever heard yourself or aware of what have been player since Genshin doing in its four years in existence and They fking know whats wrong but are lazy to fix it. Feedbacks mean nothing to them just toilet paper they will wipe their butt with. They TGAF about your opinion if it doesnt benefit their revenue.

DEVS MISHEARD."
"Yup. See Mydei, who can revive several times in a match but eventually can die."
Her mechanic isn't to busted but they dropping saber with a global passive that's a actual damage buff 💀
"The problem isn't the effect of the passive but the mechanic in itself. Yeah a free revive is fine, but what is it's a damage boost, or a Crit Rate boost, or a passive heal?
Then every single character you have become worse is you dont pull for the characters with these passives"
 @finiraelkhami8251  we actually getting one from saber like imagine if you don't get her and they start balancing for people with the global passives
I was like you when I play HI3. Guess what I got left behind because I don't have must have characters and my progress become slow and stuck. Look at them now. I'm afraid HSR will be next.
"@kelvincostner7775  no, bro. There are no must have characters, just play better. Till today, I'm still using my Blade and hit 115K damage. He's not Meta anymore but still ok if you're good at using him. Just play better using characters you have. Just get good with your characters. I also play HI3, never had any problem that you have. Sounds like a skill issue to me!"

 @edpaolosalting9116  already too late
"@wonderingstxrs om my god, you are a very wonderful person who actually uses their brain"
​ @Im_Motivated-Ayato  Even if there are more global passive in the future there is still no disadvantage to it.
​ @xeenooo  The community cant make up it's mind they complain that new characters are weak but if they make the new character strong they complain they make is bland and the same as the last one they complain no wonder hoyo aint listening.
Hoyo casually locking new modes or entire games behind new characters by 2026 because people are complacent with them
 @jetkirby3981  Delusional
"​@jetkirby3981  fyi, you can't predict the future, so none of what you said is remotely credible"
@ All you have to do is observe the actions of the company and its playerbase.
" @jetkirby3981  Sure, The Divine Foresight."
"​@jetkirby3981  that still doesn't mean you can tell the future. if the world worked like that, we wouldn't be having most of the problems we're having now."
"@ if everyone is so complacent with this, it's not that surprising it'll continue."
" @jetkirby3981  and it will change nothing. Gacha is just a gambling coated with beautiful characters and animations, at the end of the day you're the one who decides whether you will be spending or not."
"Are you new to gacha games or really low iq? Genshin has been around like almost 8 years now or more . The new character always suits moc and other game modes. There’s gonna be a boss or game mode whose gonna hit very hard that will one shot your 1 million Hp fu xuan, adventurine or whatever Sustain unit you have. Prob will have an insta kill . So you basically need that unit or have god level gear . Something most F2Ps won’t have . I’ve played for 2 years with the battle pass and it took months to get god level gear for one char . Most of my char have 85-90% efficient gear . Imagine F2P with less resources. Plus this isn’t the main problem , it’s what comes next . Units that give permanent stat boost or maybe even skip MOC itself . Someone said it was crazy , it isn’t for hoyo . They make billions but barely update their game for Qol . Other than ZZZ. Writing bloat is so bad , stories always suck unless it’s ZZZ. So many missions for little stellar jades/gems/polychrome whatever ."
" @ogbobbyjohnson3502  Sure, Divine Foresight. As always worrying about nothing, you're worrying about your self made boss that will never see the light of the day. Fortunately you're not a game designer."
"@ what are you even talking about ? Is English your first language ? What I’ve said has nothing to do with what you’re saying . What I’ve said is facts and proven ? Since day 1 in genshin and 8 years plus , hoyo makes problems then sells the solution . That’s how you make money 101. It’s basically a scheme . They make billions and people don’t care . Well they do now , isn’t it obvious . Every char they released was towarded Moc or abyss . That’s the problem , they sell the character as a solution . Do I have to explain something so basic . Why do you think they make billions . Next global passive is moc , for “lore reasons” it’s not out of the possibility . It’s prob like 10-50% chance . Theres a pattern if you didn’t even see because you’re smooth brained . Archeron passive kills enemies without fighting , next glòbal passive instant revive . Again something so basic , you couldn’t see it coming."
"​@ogbobbyjohnson3502  actually no, ive been playing for a while now (~1 year), and im an f2p player. ive played genshin, zzz and hsr. in all of these games, I ONLY pull for the characters I like, whether they're op or not. I've also built lots of 4 star/5 star standard teams which have cleared endgame content iust fine when built properly. ive almost never completely die to a boss either. so maybe next time, instead of assuming someone's experience with a topic, think clearly before running your mouth (or keyboard, in this case)
also, getting steller jades and polychromes have been fairly easy for me (zzz being the easiest. i should show you my account for that one)
also, it seems like you're projecting. none of what you said proves that castorice is a must pull. you will do fine without her, i promise"
"Yeah honestly. Global passives will not matter unless you really plan on 0 cycling moc which doesn't matter in the slightest. I'm guessing this is a one time thing as the anniversary character for the patch, but nobody can truly tell until we actually see it somewhere else. So no more complaining, just waiting is all we can do before making real statements."
"Finally someone with a clear mind, i'm tired reading all those mindless comments, 0 cycle worshippers only make it worse, they are soo dramatic"
"Maybe cause you actually need to have her equipped. Not to mention it’s really limited and drains technique points. They also limited in the SU by making items in conundrum nonexistent so you have to really savor points. Castorice on the other hand is a free restriction-less revive across your entire account just for having her. It would be a different story if having Acheron allowed all characters to insta kill enemies regardless of her being on the team, but that’s not the case is it."
They will at least add more characters to the spirit shop in the future i guess…
"If it doesn't work in the endgame, then that passive is fine. But it works there that's the problem"
"""In other words, if you're poor, just admit it and let the rich play."""
"I don't give enough shit
i play  the story i was like level 40 when I arrived in penacony and amphorius and I just pull for the characters who i like
Like tribbie"
"If your characters are dying in the first place then you need to re evaluate how you play tne game

The global passjbe wont do anything for 90 peecent of players"
casto passive wont even help you clear endgame easier. the problem is what people expect for the future global passive that it might come. you really dont have any reason to pull for casto passive alone
"If it ties into lore Acheron should also have a similar ability and so should many others like The Herta and Welt, it should be changed (not removed) to only work if she is on the team like with Bailu"
"What if there are more characters with global passives in the future, but you can only have one at a time"
"The game doesn't have PvP, the west is overdoing things so Europe's words are worthless. 🥱🥱"
"Well now... Time to pack up guys, hsr had a good run"
"The problem is not with this character's abilities, but with the upcoming characters who will have the same abilities or better ones."
"Meanwhile us veteran FGO players had to wait a whole year or maybe nver for a rerun with no guarantee or pity to get that servant. Even with a pity system introduced, you still cant get that pity as it doesn't bring the pity on other banner"
"So many Dumb comments in this post is insane, either too dumb to understand or delusional in general.

This sht raise a concern that HSR community is just full of undeveloped braincell npcs"
"You know what. For what I know if only Castorice will have that kind of ability as broken as Acheron was in 2.1, I would not mind. It's not confirmed if Hyacine would have such global passive anyway"
"The next character is probably the god of speed, and it gives us 10 global speed😅"
Seriously castorice is really good thing cause she can revive all who ones are down and there's bailu can revive only one character who are down
Its ok if only one  character have this
This will be needed cuz how current boss has higher HP and can wipe out entire team
I think they are testing how people will receive this new feature
I hope now they understand why genshin could never has a positive response lol.
"The vast majority of the players which are casuals from what I heard doesn't really care about the whole situation and its mostly the vocal minority or hardcore players of this game that is complaining. 

It's not like the passive itself is broken because she does drain HP of your allies which balances it out, but rather it will set a bad precedent for future characters of this game like global crit dmg, or speed etc. 

If they just simply give it to Castorice and not everyone else then its fine. But if they implement global passives in the future it would be smart for them to give it to the MC and not premium ""paid"" characters."
"if it was, they would have to say it in Castorice's kit."
In hi3 you had weapons that activated passives called divine keys
They would have to specify that or it’s against CN consumer Laws
"it won't happen, how else are they going to sell the characters if the global passive won't stack lmfao"
"You don't even need Castorice.

Plus the revive isn't anything special at all"
"@Yusei255  maybe rn yes, but it's the future that I'm worrying about... She will be the domino effect to something even more worse..."
My gut feeling tells me that it's not gonna be pretty in the future...
Lmao and you'll still keep playing. I know your kind of people. Keyboard warriors
​ @justpsi1stmultivtuberapost492  is this the first time? If so then your speculation is based of nothing basically
"​ @livingwarrobots4119 is this the first time? No.
Silver Wolf who gives Elemental Weakness, which bypass a game mechanic, then followed up by Boothill then Firefly.
Fugue, who bypasses elemental weakness toughness, bypassing a game mechanic.

Now we bypassing party effect limit? Good riddance."
Its really helpful in Simulated and Divergent Universe bro Dont u know how strong the last difficulty is it has 2000%+ more hp than normal bosses so with this revive u still have a chance to get a comeback and win
@randomviewer112 and that's the problem
"No we do not, I uninstalled HSR. Deleted from library.

Hoyo is ruining their game, as our Pleas fall on deaf ears. 

The pattern is there. Hoyo is slowly killing all of their games  because they hear us, but decide to do other things. 
We saw that with Genshin, ZZZ etc."
"​ @reyzer9722 ZZZ is doing just fine ??? 
They listened to alot of Feedback in the past and they still do ???"
"​ @reyzer9722  sadly we lose one of our fav player😔 the next day, hello a couple hundreds of new players😂 hsr always got the new player nothing to lose btw"
Byee
 @justpsi1stmultivtuberapost492  please do leave and never return.
 @justpsi1stmultivtuberapost492  oh yeh cuz acheron one shotting normal enemies is just OK
 @AGONY6085  exactly and watch people who are the ones who complained also pull for the character
" @reyzer9722  please never reinstall or even watch any hoyo content ever again, thank you."
 @justpsi1stmultivtuberapost492  i love how “whatifs” are the reason for leaving lol
" @reyzer9722 bro no one cares if you leave .. i love how those leaving are acting like gods or saviors being like “i’m leaving the game, good riddance hsr” and people are like “okay bye?”"
I left this bs back when Sunday came...
This ain't an airport
 @thatsaber01  Good. Eos is gonna roll up eventually
" @Im_Motivated-Ayato  Sure thing, I dont want to have to do anything with them :) thanks for the advice"
 @carlzxceeds  Good Riddance
" @Kyaaa-  To not believe the game could EOS some day of ther ""mediocrity"" is delusional, but keep telling yourself whatever you believe in"
​ @justpsi1stmultivtuberapost492 But is a disadvantage to your account ?
"​ @megumin9967 and the problem here is people really surprised with global buff I mean there's another game that has global buff way before  hsr, even the buff was way more brutal its a game changer but not locked up by a character (for a lazy person that buff was hell for me to unlock)"
​ @Kyaaa-  good on being their cash cow ;)
" @reyzer9722  if u don't want to play just quit, no one forces u to play😂 btw people keep hating on everything nowadays lol"
 @christophealexander3262  hoyo literally give 10 free pulls in every patch and in 3.2 we got 30 free pulls also extra rewards in events😉 no need to spend a single penny btw
"You guys act like whole game is Moc . There is actually people that want to get characters and play the story and event, oh no i couldn't clear Moc 12 big deal no 80 jades, people shouldn't complain when there is aura farmers clearing it with Arlan"
Damn there is alot of hoyo shill bot down here
​@randomviewer112In those modes you will be revived a lot of times due to blessings and stuff before castorice pasive cam activate 😅
"​@randomviewer112 that ""helpful"" is the problem, its only helping players that have her by winning 50/50 or whaling"
​ @Yusei255 I'll be honest this... Is something that I haven't seen in ANY gacha game before. Gaining an enormous buff to your ACCOUNT? Just by the character existing? Idk man it's kinda scary it gives precedent when a huge successful gacha game did this bs and getting away with it.
"​ @justpsi1stmultivtuberapost492 we're not even sure they'll release some REALLY BROKEN global passive in the future, and if they did, CN community will prob do something tho 🤷"
​ @yuuya3639  Castoria in FGO
Okay see ya
​ @AGONY6085 just wait to see when they announce characters with busted global passive back to back just for u to struggle
​@randomviewer112it's becuz of this type of powercreep and buff they are increasing the bosses hp% and now after castorice wait to see a 50 million hp boss
"​@Yusei255  well about that.. since castorice is here, hoyo will definitely buff the enemies hp by like 5 million or more cause she's too op which makes it harder for people achieve moc 12 without having her"
This
So you're comparing shit with shit stain?
Is it another character with similar passives?
 @howorwhat3088  who's gonna tell em
 @KingJ-the1  shhhhh
​ @KingJ-the1  nothing wrong with that bruh😂
​ @KingJ-the1 tell us! NOW
Add more to make it 180
"Next one will be the god of life, it heals your entire party by 2% every time anyone gets a turn."
Wow thats crazy!! Cant wait to get that!
" @SeEkeR-7th  it's not phainon, hycaine and safer have been leaked to have global passives"
"Create the problem sell the solution. 🤣
People don't understand after Castorice the game is going to get harder."
​ @agnesfodornevarga7702 nah not really😂
"It's a slippery slope. Plus, there is ZERO reason why it should work when she's not in your team"
the problem isnt about how strong the passive is its about the fact that more passive like this (even more powerful) will be coming out soon
People give it too much importance for a single player game)
"Ahahah imagine crying on a single player game that dont even have PvP and crying for meta, how pathetic these people"
we're gonna get some BS like +500% crit damage passive in like a year or two lmfao
I'm not going to complain untill the second global passive comes so we can see how they are treated. I imagine their going to only let you have one global passive active so your not benefiting from 50 different passives
"For genshin players, this is like Barbara and qiqi c6 work without them being on the team"
"So wait, if cast-rice is not in the team. The team still get revive? That's almost like that requires to certain characters"
My wifeyy
DEAD game
I think one thing they could do is make the passive activating count as a character falling in battle
"if you don't want the global passive, then don't pull for her. easy"
girl a 1 hp revive isnt forcing people to pull its useless and you shouldn't even be dying to begin with
"Hahaha, stop playing hoyo game bro, they're suck, move to other game bro😂"
When she is in the team then yeah it's good but it's a goblet passive which who's to say future characters won't do the same
When the best anniversary gift would have been Hoyoverse sayinf that they're making the weapon banner be guaranteed and instead we just got this
"It’s better version of Bailu, in which you don’t even need her in the team."
"If you think this is a ""opinion"" topic you have lost already."
"Both. It is lore equivalent, it IS unique, but it’s also busted as hell. Those two things are not mutually exclusive."
If you wanna Make global passive just make it not tight with character
" @impact6808  holy glaze

Acting like people weren't constantly complaining about loot boxes like 10 years ago. Dare I say Diablo Immortal?"
 @impact6808  just your a gacha tourist
" @KingJ-the1  LMAO i play gacha since 2013 and i play hoyo games since 2015 and am i a gacha tourist?! LMAO
In my 12 years of gacha games i have never cared for meta and i didn't have any problems"
"@impact6808  that's a not a long time? What😭 I don't care how you flex you wasted hours hsr is the first hoyo game of its kind where power creep has been this bad and has mattered this much hi3  was really just a experiment game, never played ggz because I'm not a creep, gi is a dead game and power creep takes forever, and zzz is fine, boothill literally got made obsolete in like 1 patch the game is now closer to eos now than ever before, go ahead defend your billion dollar company"
" @KingJ-the1  lmao you are just a meta slave crybaby, powercreep this powercreep that ahahah cry for powercreep because you cant beat single player mobs? Lmao

Ggz i always used first trio until the game EoS, Hi3 i always used HoR since her release until today, Genshin i always main Keqing since 1.0 until today, HSR i still main Seele + Silverwolf until today and ZZZ i still use Soldier 11 + Anby + Lucy until today and i don't have any problems, only meta slaves make drama for everything ""ohhh noooo new character is stronger, that is powercreep now my character is useless😭😭"" ahaha how pathetic"
" @KingJ-the1  lmao your is just a metaslave behaviour, imagine crying for meta because you cant beat mobs in a single player game where there is no ranking neither PvP lmao… “ohhhh nooo new character is stronger, that is powercreep and now my current main is useless😭😭” ahaha how pathetic.

With GGZ i used first trio until the game EoS, HI3 i main HoR since her release until today, GI i main Keqing since 1.0 until today, HSR i main Seele and Jingliu until today, ZZZ i main Soldier 11 until today, also for other games too like PGR, WuWa, Nikke, Fatego,  never fucking cared about meta characters unlike metaslaves crybabies that crying for powercreep for every new characters lmao"
 @Fluskar  who's gonna tell em
it still sets a precedent of them purposely attaching a desirable passive like a crit buff to a character hoyo knows will not sell well. even if it means little in the overall scope it still feels like a low jab.
 @alliffplayz7746  you lack future vision
"It is what it stands for hyacine has already been leaked to give absurd speed buffs, phianon is leaked to have global damage"
"​ @KingJ-the1  those aren't confirmed, might as well wait to see them officially"
"@wonderingstxrs nope they don't remove global passives, when the kits get fully leaked it's soft confirmed"
"Meh, it's no biggie I won't pull her either imma go all out for acheron, 4 more eidolon to E6 her"
I think Castorice's buff should only apply if she's on a team and ONLY for that team
"As OP as it looks, it does have some flaws. Like if the res timing isn't right and the enemy take turn after the res, then the ally would still die. And if the enemy is faster (which is true according for the next moc), it'd be hard to heal the revived ally right after the res. And ofc, the healer would carry more than the global passive.

Most of the concerns are about the precedent about future meta shift which is understanable cuz it could change the premise of the team building. Like imagine if it's spd buff or True dmg or weakness implant, those passives would change the way of the gameplay. But if it's something like 10% dmg buff, I think the main kit of the character would have heavier value than the global buff. And ofc, they should limit the amount of global passives that we can use in the future cuz imagine if all of those passives stacked together in a battle"
"The problem y'all is that it doesn't lie within the passive, it's what other people think.
I 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 think her passive is already enough and can still be power crept considering that she only revives our teammates in 1 HP (instead of like at least half of HP or full).
But with all that aside, The passive is already good enough. They just have to balance it out simply by just removing the passive activating even when she's not in the team.
Edit: The patch hasn't released fully yet, so making conclusions and assumptions is not good."
"If you can beat endgame just fine, no need to pull. No body’s forcing you to pull for her, I don’t get why people are so brain dead…"
I mean when was hsr not pay to win 😂 the meta changes like every 2 patches. The only reason I couldn't continue playing Hsr was that I am strictly f2p. the meta is not consistent and old characters become unplayable in the endgame.
"I am legit now in the belief that they just cannot listen, even after all the test they have decided to make this final. I have no idea why they want to do this outside of money, but I guess really ticking off your player base is probably worth it."
"A Western video game sells you XP boosters, battle passes, and an option to unlock the entire map, and everybody loses their mind

A Chinese video game lets you gamble to potentially unlock a character who lets you cheat death, and people online hust eat it up every time"
I mean let’s be honest. Its not as if she’s gonna be the only one who has this mechanic.
"First of all, this is a gacha game, it was designed so that people would donate. Secondly, crying about powercreep when you can't get 80 jade from highgame (which is difficult in purpose) is kinda pathetic.

Her global passive itself is mid. Many argue about this mechanic because doomposters (among whom there may be wuwa fans) say that in the future there will be even more characters with this feature. This is just speculation. And even if it turns out to be true, remember Acheron and her technique that allows you to skip battles with mobs and how it caused whining. So what now? She's still a good DD, but not a must pull.
And if that's not enough, look at HI3, where global passives (Divine Keys) are commonplace."
for lore approved but for in game...uuuhhhhhhhhhh....
"I think alot of players are acting like it's the end of the world. Her passive isn't going to blow sustain units out of the water

Edit: I fully acknowledge the fact that it might ruin future global passive but I'm just using an example"
It's genuinely not as bad as people make it out to be Global passives themselves could be a problem but this one specifically is not such a big deal imo.
"at this point global passives will be a thing. so what im now asking is way they can balance having global buffs, make it that only 1 global buff can be active at a time. just so players wont have to feel like they have to pull ALL characters that stacks up all at once. and it will give players some time to save for a future character with a different passive"
Yay hoyo I want money......
"There are two problems: 

1. The passive works even when she isn’t in the team which just doesn’t make sense. The revive is ok if she’s on the team because her play style is risky. 

2. There’s the possibility that future characters will get even more absurd global passive like permanent stat bonuses. Also it has the chance to spread not just to hoyo games but other gacha games too.

The severity of this can best be understood if a very widely detested character like Aglaea had a global passive like +15% SPD or something. Essentially forcing you to consider characters you otherwise dislike.

Edit: The Castorice glazers have arrived lol.

I just want to say: Pull any character you want. PLEASE! It's the only thing stopping this game from turning into a wasteland of meta slaves. A game is made not only by the devs but also the community. But I'm afraid that a lot of people are seeing the hsr devs not fully listening to the community and a certain sect of the community defending the devs at all costs. This kind of behaviour will just ruin the game in the long run and nobody wants that to happen."
I guess I should be lucky for not doing end-game content then.
"Blah blah blah yall talking about precedent and how Hoyo ""might"" ""potentially"" ""hypothetically"" be greedy, but there already is a preceent and we can see how it played out in HI3 (it wasnt that bad at all, sure it gives a competitive edge, but thats because of how the games leaderboards work)"
It’s not even pay to win you aren’t forced to pull her
"""It's just horse armor""
""it's just skins""
""it's just loot boxes""
""it's just battlepasses""
""it's just $600 for C1 Furina"""
"With another global passive, right?"
1hp is enough for luocha auto heal proc
"​​​​ @marczhu7473  Yeah that works.
(Thank goodness Hoyo didn't go too far from this)"
" @Wan2HeavenlyWeapon  1 HP does not matter. Any characters that get revived from it are immune to death until they get healed or get a shield. You people are misunderstanding how her revive works and why it is such a problem that it's a global passive. So yes, Hoyo did go too far."
"​ @XenoWars  Yea, and when the player fails to heal or shield that revived character, they become downed immediately. I agree that Hoyo might gone too far. That passive is already good though, but we have to remove the passive activating even when she's not in the team. That would balance it, the end 🙌"
Bruh..😂 of course user having castorice profile gonna defend this
"Come on think outside of the box. If your passive can do easily be powercrept, you don't think there will be stronger passives? Your pfp is showing."
"The issue is the precedent this sets, not the fact it’s actually broken. We all know this isn’t the last time hoyo is going to implement this, hell just take a look at HI3 where divine keys, the equivalent of global passives, are extremely common among units. It’s more brain dead to think this isn’t an issue at all"
" @ronreed4050 People still play HI3 and aren’t really complaining from what I can see, so Hoyo might’ve found a way to make it balanced."
Yeah like we dont know what they do in endgame bosses nowadays where you literally cant kill it with 1.X C6R5 Jingliu lmao
I'm f2p as well and I clear endgame just fine with old characters. they aren't unusable
"That's their problem, they first listen, but the words come out of the second ear. 
What this means? Well they decide to hear but later ignore players feedback. 
They do this with surveys. Hear what players have to say but later decide to not do what asked or, or they do another game with those changes, that no one asked for. 
That is Hoyo is slowly killing its own games. Because they would rather be blind and deaf to problems than to solve them."
"acheron tech is literally just qol, i nvr understood why so many ppl like you like to use this as your argument when its not even remotely close to powercreep implications that castorice's global passive has when its all but confirmed that it can be used in endgame. 

also, your argument abt the precedent of stronger global passives being merely speculation? really? are you such a kind soul to give a fomo-heavy company like this the benefit of the doubt? 

even if stronger global passives attached to future characters turns out to not be a must-pull, it still feels like shit. at this point, its not about the 80 jades anymore, its abt hoyo not respecting your investments and game progression all for the sake of their profits. they are literally telling veteran f2ps/small spenders to fuck off or pay up."
"You missed the point. The point is that this allows for other more broken global buffs in the future. Just as increased speed, talent level, skill point etc. just like how silverwolf allowed them to make boothill, firefly, anaxia, etc."
Someone needs to develop their brain because he is clearly too dumb to get involved or raise his opinion in this matter
It's not there yet... But there will be there in the future where some characters with global Passive straight up giving Shield and Healing... And from there.. You won't even need Sustain or Support anymore
" @graesongill  until we get a character who has global passive that heals you and another one that gives you free 20% CR

Then you'll have so many icons on your screen that'd you think you're playing League of Legends 😂"
The issue is this could be the start of them doing this more. More and more buffs or perks from characters just for existing. And if you don’t have these characters you are losing out on massive benefits. I mean Cas literally gives you a safety net per battle just for owning her
"What I find problematic as well is how this will shape the kind of bosses we get patches onward.
Like what if the bosses just straight up one shots your character through shield and mitigation, having this revive is not only convinient but is required as well"
"​@komodo7044 Tbf, Boothill and Firefly's work best on mono physical or mono fire teams. Now, Anaxa's is more broken as allows one to have a more diverse team."
There's really no issue it's just hating hoyo is meta
I don't think they would do that...
"@ ik.. just like how everyone was asking to remove/rework Castorice's passive, hoyo will probably ignore this idea too"
statwise buffs wont be happening the global passives are likely to be limited to enemy debuffs and bad sustain but usable sustain
​ @ARIV4RSAL  might happen tho..hoyo is scummy
"""Very widely detested"" ??? Bro how is Aglaea widely detested? If you wanted a character to use as an example of a hated character, you could've used Jade"
" @ARIV4RSAL  So you’re saying something like permanent 10% Def Shred. Yeah no, still doesn’t sound any better"
It ain’t that deep bro js get good 😭🙏
" @FacelessStarCarver  Nope, Aglaea is hated a lot, the amount of hate you perceive naturally depends on the kind of content you see(I say this as an Aglaea main myself). I used Aglaea as an example purely because it was most of the Castorice glazers who were hating on her and using Castorice as the reason they were skipping her."
"You're living in ""whatifs"""
"You’re correct, there’s a “possibility”. So far she’s the only one and the anniversary character of the game, so I’m guessing we’re not gonna see anything similar until 4.x. If you don’t like her mechanics, just don’t pull."
​ @Franceee___ its could be worse if they consider its into scaling of the difficulty make all the mod even harder because of thats passive ability
" @Franceee___  Considering that the main stars of the show Phainon and Cyrene will be coming in 3.x, I doubt we’ll have to wait long. 

Also, the fandom can be extremely hypocritical sometimes. If they do implement the global passive and then decide to never do something like that again, there would be outcry on why the most significant characters of the plot didn’t have an overpowered ability."
 @makisky4495  It’s all fun and games as long as it’s a character you’re simping over isn’t it?
"Also, they could make a bullshit boss design that could one shot your entire active party."
 @FacelessStarCarver  crazy that that’s the thing you focus on help
​@DissapearAmongTheSeaOfButter  I don't know. It's unlikely considering Stat based relics. Like needing low speed for the full effect. Statwise buffs throw those put of place
"​@SilverArrow10  Ohhhhh I see, that makes sense. I'm an Aglaea main too, so I was a bit confused. Thanks for the clarification!"
"The revive is good and all but not gamebreaking. With good sustain the revive is irrelevant for the most part just like how Bailu revive and Huohuo revive (accessed via Eidolons). Sure, you can use it without sustain and be revive for an extra turn with 1hp but imagine its the boss turn, it downed a character in your team and it still has a turn (most bosses has 2-3 turn) then that revived character is good as dead.

To answer you first question, yes, it doesn't make sense that she can revive even without her being on the team but dont forget that Castorice will basically become a demi god in this upcomimg patch.

To answer your second question, this global passive is probably just a one time gimmick because it will be the 2nd anniversary of HSR. But there's also a chance that this would be a thing in the future and it up to the devs whether they want to cause more powercreeping to their game. Call this a copium or whatever. I enjoy the game and its story is all that matters."
so bad faith argument only? ok
Omg the jade stans coming for you​ @FacelessStarCarver 
People hate Aglaea
"Meh 
Even if they add a +50% damage for a character I don't like I ain't pulling for them
I see most people complain that they make it p2w like bruh
You can't make me p2w if I'm broke😂
They can add all those buffs that change the game but that doesn't mean I have to spend money 

Not everyone plays and enjoy this game by 0 cycle every end game content 

I play for the story and hot characters XD that doesn't mean I have to get them when I can see them in game"
"​ @ARIV4RSAL  nah, they'll always find a way"
​ @BlameHari13   I am a Jade stan I fear 💔 I just used her as an example cause I know a LOT of people hate her
@Zioclaw2.0-il1fr   If the game becomes P2W even story content will become so egregiously hard it won't be fun anymore..unless you swipe. That's what pay 2 win means
@SilverArrow10 in the face of 48 defense shred from pela's ult its nothing and it would more likely have to be some sort of trigger to it like hitting a certain weakness of enemy
 @FisaliaMamamiaBadonkas  not that scummy i'd expect something like that in genshit
"Why is it a problem? R u the god balance? They r forcing u to play in the most efficient way? If u roll for stats/meta for a char u deslike u still doing it because u want, anyway if global passives r profitable they will do some more obviously"
" @rieru_6767  * Looks at Flame Reaver * 

Yeah that would be sad"
" @Kuhakuuuu  While the revive in itself isn’t super game breaking, it still doesn’t mean we won’t get something absurd in the future. Like Acheron came out and broke the game, but then Feixiao and FF matched her almost immediately. Also from what I have seen of the mechanic, they remain at one hp for one turn and it doesn’t matter if they get hit. If they get a heal or shield before that one turn, they’re fine. I actually saw a play through of the 3.2 moc on a channel where the entire team got one shot by the boss but Castorice revive saved the run. 

Castorice becoming a demigod and is therefore OP argument doesn’t make sense really. And considering that Phainon and Cyrene will be 5 times more anticipated than Castorice, they will most definitely have global passives. 

I enjoy the story too but you do realise that all the actual story bosses and stuff have certain mechanics that cater to the new characters. Like that Flame Reaver boss. Pretty difficult to clear normally without a shielder. The new Pollux boss is also tailor-made for Castorice."
"Ofcourse they gonna cry, they don't want Castorice but now they also know they're weak so they'd need to get her. It's mostly the weak gatekeeping players crying about this😂 I myself wanted Cas because she's dammn beautiful but this is even better"
" @ARIV4RSAL  Ah yes you have two pela and can put a pela in every team, can’t you? All our best teams have pela in them, don’t they?"
"I see the issue, yeah"
​ @araragikoyomi8559  I also liked Cas ever since Amphoreus trailer dropped and the reason why I saved ever since I pulled Fugue banner.
 @araragikoyomi8559  Sorry to break your bubble but Mydei performs just as good as Cas and mind you he still doesn’t have his bis team
Cyrene will get that we can equip five characters we need to hope hoyo changes it
@SilverArrow10 ruan mei res pen can replace pela's defense shred same with tribbie's res pen replacing ruan mei's so yes I have 2 characters I can replace with pela/pela can be replaced by (with acheron teams being an exception)
"@SilverArrow10 You're not breaking anyone's bubble Lil bro, the weak players and people who barely manage to 36* the Moc are the kinda ones crying because they wanna gatekeep, and ofcourse the people who never planned on pulling her. Your argument about Mydei ain't even related to my comment"
​@SilverArrow10 i have to disagree with aglaea take. She did get doomposted because she did not powercreep other characters. But she is in no way very hated.
"All the outrage is basically just people constantly projecting how in the future they just gonna spam global passives for characters. Keep in mind this trait of her is essentially only reserved for characters released during anniversary, last year we had acheron and till to this day she is the only that has the instakill technique same with castorice with her ""global passive "" also if acheron sells so well why they didn't just introduce a character that can basically instakill an elite/boss enemy too? castorice global passive is really mid too it literally just gives you 1 hp and if you don't heal them or give them shield for 1 turn they just gonna die again even without the enemy hitting you. Most players that grind endgames never ever have to worry about dying in the first place the only way this passive gonna be viable is in the highest difficulty of DU and SU expansions (which is optional)"
"@ Have you been on hoyolab bro? People HATED her. Doomposting was also rampant yea but people were mad about that entire interrogation scene where she gets Castorice to touch you if you fail. There defo was hate, but again depending on the content you saw you might not have felt that people hated her."
"​@SilverArrow10Acheron is released with one shot technique, that also means that it's a precedent for a character that one shot elite, then a boss, then weekly boss, then endgame would be clearable at the cost of 1 technique point

That's basically your thought process, if you think those things i mention are BS compared to acheron technique, then idk why you would think a one time revive that doesn't let you play in a sustainless team is comparable to global buff of 15% spd and 10% def shred, because those are also BS compared to castorice revive"
"@ some people fr don’t get the point. Did you just replace a four star with five star alternatives Oml. Not everyone has every support bruh. And again, it’s all fun and games as long as it’s a character you like."
"⁠​⁠ @araragikoyomi8559  Regular 36 star MoC guy here. I’ve completed all the end game modes completely every patch since 1.1, and I can still say that Castorice having global passive is too broken and just unhealthy both for HSR and the gacha space. And before yes, I’ve already planned on pulling her and I will still do it (I won’t spend money for her tho) since I just like her design. 
Your argument is just incredibly stupid. Why? It’s simple. There is no single actual reasonable argument that is rooted in logic and not just rooted in feelings. You say that the ones hating Castorice having a global passive are the ones who didn’t want to pull for her but are forced to since they’re account is too weak, either because they just started or because they reached a stagnant stage in mid game. But isn’t this just proving their point that Castorice’s global passive is unhealthy for the game? How can you even consider a character good if players are outright forced to pick her up. And this is not even the main point of issue here. The issue is just that everything you said is based on what you believe the truth is, without any objective fact to back it up. It’s like I just say that people who like Castorice’s kit are dick sucking hoyoshills. It’s dumb, isn’t it? Especially if I don’t even explain why people should hate Castorice’s kit. That’s what you’re doing, while the side that argues that Castorice is bad is actually presenting some objective facts."
"Abt the 2, this already exist on many others gacha games"
"​ @ARIV4RSAL won't happen ?? Bro most of the upcoming characters global passive are buffing them, firstly saber (she increase skills ND basic attack trace lvl by 1), Phainon (increase atk), and lastly Cyrene (Increase Max HP and SPD) but thank God all of them are my fave character and my gacha plan from the very start anyway"
"Even on gaming standard, that is just too broken and not a good mechanic overall. Essentially like per account that have castorice, their games will be much more easier compared to those that don't have her?"
"The problem here is that you keep mentioning that ""it's forcing you to pull for the character, even if you don't want to."" Bro, if that's the case, the problem is yours. You're forcing yourself because you feel like it. If you don't like the character and it has a global passive, don't go for it. I'm sure that all the time you've been playing the game you haven't had any problems getting through the endgame."
" @Shreggy  can you give me a source or is it a trust me bro type of thing, cause i follow leak and there's not a single mention about another global passive"
But sadly the hoyodogs are too blind by this and just I've enough of hoyos bs that I stopped playing at 3.0 patch that itself is evidence that the game is slowly turning into genshin
"Yes there are, I doesn't really know who is the leaker but if you want to know you can watch Homuboy (sorry if the name was wrong) but they don't use english. He mentioned about the future global buffs also phainon global buffs used to be ""all character can use 2 lightcone"" and Cyrene was used to be ""increase the capacity of character in a team by 1 (5 Chara/team)""​ @zard2341 "
"@ And another one spectacularly misses the point. 

Acheron needs to be on the team to kill the enemies. Castorice doesn’t need to be on the team to revive. Hence the entire global passive. 

Also acherons technique is much more comparable to natlan characters in genshin with all of their exploration utility. Doesn’t do much for combat , but it’s a nice qol thing."
@SilverArrow10 ya'll too you young to worry and over think things
 @FacelessStarCarver not hated but didn’t sell well because of Sunday
"Imo it's the best if the want to release global buff not from some sort of RNG-wall character (you don't guarantee to get Castorice anyway right?), they should add it through other way like by clearing story, etc. for ex: in Cookie Run Kingdom from the early update they release a feature called ""laboratory"", so you can increase your cookies power (by atk, hp, def, etc.) by using production resources since the game itself was an RPG-City build game, for HSR I guess it can be transformed similarly to the circuit system in the Divergent Universe but work for all content and instead of RNG type of gacha to get it it will be more grindy since hsr itself is lack of content (for me)"
"@SilverArrow10 except that there's literally 0 content in the game that doesn't let you swap to acheron to use her technique and then swap back to your actual team, so it's literally an account buff, but more scuffed because it forces you to swap to her

And castorice passive is also QoL? If you play sustainless then your team would stay dead because it requires heal/shield before the next turn, if you play sustain and you're still experiencing death on your team, it's either a build issue or there's more concerning problem with the boss balancing, so the only time where it actually matter is if you're new and only have natasha and march for sustain, or rng like hoolay locking one of your team 4 time in a row, it doesn't affect what you can achieve in endgame at all beside having to restart due to bad rng"
@ARIV4RSAL  diff dev team yea but still same company so the scuminess can still be in effect :v
"So who's gonna tell this dude? 
This is also the reaction of people who's only dipped their toes into Gacha"
"@Rinn_qwerty  C'mon now we all have that one guy who will come forward and say been 36* since 1st patch and all that bs, what's even your point? I've been seeing how the HSR community keeps growing more and more toxic and have a problem with each and everything that's being released.

As per you ""good points"" that the Castorice haters are getting up, in my view is absolute bs, because that means in the long run we are only going to have character that have nothing special atall, similar skill sets, like what am I gonna do with 2 characters that have instakil like Acheron or running fast like Feixiao? 

This is a long term game, there should definitely be stuff that makes the game easier over time for people and this stuff SHOULD BE DIFFERENT from any existing characters. Global passives seem the best way to start it, and the way y'all make it sound is like Cas is buffing 100-200cd is she? No she's not, she's reviving a character I can imagine to what length HSR's community stupidity would go to if the global passive was actually an atk boost or speed boost of sorts.

I just cannot see straight with a fandom that hates on everything and goes toxic sorry boss, you may be a meta guy, but I'm someone who plays this game to enjoy."
The only thing they have to do is create a switch off button for thisn.
" @Shreggy  lying out your ahh in here man lmao, provide the sources if you got it i quite literally deep dive into leaks and never in my life have seen any info nor bread crumbs regarding the stuff that you just mentioned"
@ I guess we’ll just have to play the game as long as it’s still fun then.
"@ItsBiox  i just forgot the name, this fandom is really toxic huh"
@ I guess we’ll just have to play the game as long as it’s fun then.
@Lunafreya12  it's an interesting aspect but I don't think anyone who has the feature would opt to use it?
 @Shreggy  basic excuse when someone just lied out of their ahh. Ain't no way you remember the every details of said info and just suddenly forgot the source LMAO fake leaks and infos are spreading like wildfire out here man
"@SilverArrow10  there's no ""point"" its only you and the over thinkers ""point"".

The only problem is the problem you make inside your heads.

Stop over thinking, if you're not having fun anymore playing games then just quit.
If you really have concern say it to the survey the devs send and hope for the best and wait. 

The game is not even PvP, they already acknowledged the ""issue"" regarding power crept so they're looking into it.

If only people would only stop getting swayed by the exaggerations that most CC do to get more views on their content this community will become much better."
I just saw it turn from 999 likes to 1k likes in real time lmao
I don't believe they gonna add the stat boost global passives I do believe it's a one time thing and well if they do add it if hsr becomes more generous so you are able to get em if you want and everything isn't necessarily a must pull it's not gonna be an issue
" @ItsBiox  i guess my comment doesn't sent, let me sent it again"
" @ItsBiox  and yeah there's a lot of fake leaks and infos nowadays, that's why I take everything with a grain of salt"
" @Shreggy  this is really a crucial time where fake leaks or just some made up bs can spread like crazy and some people that's oblivious to these will accept it as hard facts. i actually stumble upon some reddit posts talking about said infos but then again they don't have a legitimate evidence for it basically just goes on ""trust me"" bro basis"
" @Shreggy  source that actually reliable is only to an extend of the next version and some bread crumbs for the version after that, if there's a leak of things that is way more ahead than than, i can assure you that it's either fake or something that's 100% going to change"
"@zard2341  thats why I take everything with grain of salt and it cam give a little insight about Cyrene and Phainon being another global buff char, wich is obvious for me because they were like the icon for this update and Phainon being some kind the mc of Amphoreus (I mean he was the first we met, and he's also a Kevin expy so it wouldn't be weird, for Cyrene she is obviously Elysia expy because they share teh same VA just like how Raiden expys shares teh same VA)"
" @Shreggy  ""it's obvious because this one leaker that no one know about and the one that knew literally don't even remember where he find it said so"" yeah, no lol

Also actual reliable leaker: this is the icon for castorice revive
Literally the next day: my bad it's just a buff icon for castorice, not her revive

Leaker saying anything doesn't make it obvious at all even when it's from beta, let alone some random one that you can't even give the source from"
​ @kingjoee6821  Yeah like using a Break Team to defeat an Enemy that needs to be Weakness Broken. Like Nikador that needs an AOE team to defeat it faster.
You're so real... I don't really play hsr but i'm really scared that global passives might become a thing in other games too :(( I would be very disappointed if zzz turned THIS greedy
possibly. okay ? not yet so stop yapping
@zard2341  I give the source? Please read again or this fandom is really that illiterate
"@zard2341  and who said it make that obvious, I only said that we can get a little a view for the upcoming characters, it's people fault anyway if they trust leaks 100%"
"@SilverArrow10 hardly, I don't really go for female characters"
"lol dayum this has become a long, hotly contested thread."
" @Shreggy  ""i forgot the name"" no, you didn't give me the source

""It's obvious for me"" i literally just quote what you said

I guess I'm illiterate for repeating what you said lmao"
@zard2341  the source is uncle titanoboa (my replies keep not sending so sorry if you waited)
"​ @zard2341 if you want it just tell me, I'll give you my DC (the link keep not sending, I've tried my best for 10 minutes of trying)"
"I feel like this is moreso around “whatifs” and nothing factual. Its why Im not buying the hate on it until whatever they say is proven. There is yet to be evidence to support the claims that hoyo would/could do this to other characters and or have it worse. Its all based on speculation and opinion and no facts to prove it. 

If you pull for castorice, im guessing youre gonna be using her so her being off the team isnt that worried about. If you dont use her after pulling her and she revives you…..youre still gonna die if you suck. If you have a solid team, there isnt a need to worry about castorice. In fact her helping once is..nice! But you can still very much die again."
@MiyuKawaski You're the only one here who isnt arguing. Your comment just gives off chill guy who has fun from observing miniscule stuff energy
Hahaha
"The are already many gachas that use such things. Hell i play one that literally EVERYTHING you have ( chars, weapons, itens, skins ) give boosts to your team. So yes, i am afraid that Hoyo may fall this path. Why? 💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸"
"Cry and whining the ultimatum level, are you not tired of yourself?"
 @Franceee___  speaking about leaks here: the global passives will have a dedicated menu to show which ones are in effect in combat. So it will not be one and more will probably come fast (Phainon or Cyrene is my guess).
"Castorice playstyle Will never bê risky, the best way to regain her Ult IS HEALING, and If you get tô 1 HP, Polux takes the Damage instead of the teammate."
@ I like to think the devs know what they’re doing and have a clear business plan for the game. But yeah who knows maybe this strategy will backfire
"​ @Franceee___  Don't like the mechanics that can affect the entire future and difficulty of the game and other games? Don't play.

LMAO, what kind of argument is that, the game already has an abnormal lack of balance + just 5* characters broken one after another since 2.5 and you think this won't affect the future of the game? Try defeating a strong Boss with Gepard or Himeko, it will tell you a lot about how this can impact the future of game."
​ @toosmoofoyou True but if everyone was waiting until it's 100% confirmed then it would be rather too late to complain
It's not that deep bro ​@SilverArrow10
"Nah, we're listening to the ""Community"" (The loud minority of it) But we just don care. It's a cool and unique ability, it's honestly not that deep. Also, the devs don't HAVE to listen to anyone, it's their game they can make any Character they want. 

That's like if you were an author, and you really liked a Character but the loud minority of your readers didn't, Would you write them out/change them? No you Wouldn't."
"@ and it seems like the attacks of Pollux, including its nuclear blow after the expenditure of his total HP, also restore the HP to all members of the team, correct me if it is not"
"Glazers?
98% of the comments are discussing the passive and it's split between people for and against it. You're making up stuff atp.

Also, no one's forcing anyone to do anything. You can go just fine without her. Her passive is just an added bonus, like any other character.

No one's at fault for people not having the self control to choose not to pick her, thats a problem on them.

Your statement makes it seem that if they actually go through with the changes that it takes away the players choice. You still have the choice to pick the character you like regardless. This isn't some change that'll make the game unplayable unless you pick a certain character."
Is that a bad thing? People will work around the mechanic to make more devilish playstyle and it is interesting
"@Franceee___  You actually nailed it. They have a BUSINESS PLAN, since they are a company. It's not ""make all of the player wishes true"" plan. At the end of the day they have to incite to spend more one way or another. I just hope it stay very limited but I already see a way to punish Castorice non-owners (or those who don't minmax their accounts)."
"​@Rinn_qwerty6 month from now her passive will be considered mid because you can always step up the game and thats what they try with every single character from now.
What if the next Update is in a realm with an area dot after each cycle like in sam boss fight? Your 1hp revival would be completely useless. 

So everyone stop the crying and keep pulling for the characters you enjoy"
"YESS JUST PULL THE CHARACTERS YOU WANT!!
I really love your intake ^^"
"Stat buffs kinda already happen in hi3 through divine keys (Not sure if this counts though, if it's not then imma just remove this)"
 @makisky4495  my brother in christ the feature is going live
 @Nousername646  trueee
@Julia_Lopez can't wait my brother 😁ready to move on to next controversy ppl don't like
"​ @makisky4495 But the fact of the matter is if she sells well (and she will) that will be their excuse to make more global passives. It starts off with Cas's revive, but what happens if the next passive is Crit Rate or Crit Damage or Attack % or Break Effect? Or a healer who just gives your account extra Healing Output? These are very obvious ways that Hoyo could exploit the global passives to make characters absolute must haves, and it's better to just not have the passives at all."
Aglaea isn't widely detested in any sense lmao
 @FisaliaMamamiaBadonkas  both genshin and hi3 have global passives.
"​ @Franceee___  its already been leaked that at least 3 more characters in 3.x will have a global passive. No matter what way you twist this it is anti-consumer do not defend a billion dollar company for implementing fomo on a character you think is hot.

It powercreeps old units more than their current issue, it forces players to keep pulling as many characters as they can to boost their account. Castorice is by all means ""a must have"" due to her kit and her passive. the future units will also be ""must haves"" due to their global passive alone. And before you claim that ""the leaks may not be real"" let me remind you that hoyoverse leaks are insanely proven to be correct. 

Remember the firefly is sam theory before the 2.0 trailer even got released? Or how about this situation where leaks showed months in advance that this was gonna happen? Or maybe that 3.0s world is based off greek mythology and the HI3 flamechasers? The list goes on and on go on older videos that came out far before their respective updates and you will see that the leaks are next to always accurate.

This is not a game of ""will it or wont it"" it will happen in a game already suffering from a humongous power creep issue.


A reminder that hoyo games by history (since honkai impact 3rd) set precedent in other gacha games. So this issue is also going to spread into other games one way or another its happened nearly every time.

As a lover of HSR myself who has been playing since the 1.0 CBT this game has increasing been implementing anti consumer practices with no sign of stopping. Once more i remind you stop defending a billion dollar company making financial gain only decisions that ruin your beloved game.

Global passives are not good when they are implemented on limited time characters. If it were placed on the MC or the main astral express crew/ most standard units then it would be different because everyone has them but castorice and the future characters for the foreseeable future are limited time"
" @mr.applejuice8546  be reasonable and kinda update with the times. There's no way you ppl would be using old characters like gepard for months and months, Let alone years"
 @mr.applejuice8546  your expectations are your problems
I agree with your 1st point the revive is fine its basically like Bailu the problem is that it activates when she isnt in the team and that wont be changed due to the laws over there if im not wrong only hope is that the backlash wont make them do any more global passives and that they atleast make a setting to turn Castorice global passive off so that it only works for teams shes actually in
 @aetherald3963  wjat is the global passive in Hi3? I haven't played that game in a long time so idk and for genhsin it was from that gamemode (the theatre one I think? I'm still new to genshin so I don't really know about the newest endgame content)
"Meta slaves have already started ruining the community long ago

This is like a small minority of the community at large, by the way."
 @Shreggy  for HI3 its minor boost to stats like atk you get from pulling certain weapons. it barely had any effect in end game. for genshin its utility passives like shoguns mora cost while upgrading.
"Oh believe me, future passive WILL get more absurd.

Also this global passive is throwing power scalling out of the window since now Cast is way stronger than Emanator level characters."
"@aetherald3963  how many weapons there are? Btw global passive also is exits on other ha ha games as well like in Cookie Run: Kingdom, etc."
Enemy debuffs are bad too ​ @ARIV4RSAL 
 @Shreggy  iirc theres a few but you can only get 13 of them to give you global stats. And idc how other games do their global passives. i care about how mhy has done theirs. im not gonna use another games monetary tactics to predict how another will do theirs.
"@aetherald3963  thats a lot, anyways what is iirc"
" @makisky4495  of course not i never said that. Eventually as in any live service the old characters will not be as good that is basic gaming expectations.

I never once expected selee to be the top tier dps for the rest of time, or for gepard to be the infinite tank her was in 1.0 but there is a very big difference between expecting general character balance and removal of fomo releases and expecting for every character to somehow be on the same level.

Hsr has an hp inflation powercreeping issue with generally recent units that were released less than a year ago that already dragged some people away. But this global passive is adding something on top


I ask every defender here, what exactly is the issue with the gobal passive being on the mc or only when castorice is on the team? 

The answer is none at all

The same goes for the future units that will undeniable have global passives in greater form because and i will say this very clearly castorice's passive in itself is not overpowered dying has never been an issue in this game.

The issue has never been the power of castorice's passive but its implementation

Ignoring any sort of critsism to the game state does not ""help you make the game better"" it is entirely fair for me and other to say that we do not want characters made fomo while ""older characters"" who were released less than a year ago get their kits power crept 

Locking a global buff behind a gambling paywall is anti consumer. 

The second a good global passive is put behind a character you dont actually want you or others who are actively defending this will start complaining only for this community to again backtrack and start defending that

During the powercreep debacle this communities arguement against CC's were ""stop using 1.x units"" when next to no one even uses them anymore

Then when the castorice leaks came out this community defended it by saying ""its beta test only itll get removed"" only for that to be proven wrong

now we are at this point where many of you are saying ""oh itll only be on her"" with no sort of proof to even back it up


If you do not believe me on any of these points go right ahead and backtrack videos on these discussions. its hypocritical

When do you guys stop sucking the developers cock and draw a line? I seriously wonder


The global passive is anti consumer end of fucking story it isnt that hard to tell it is and yet you defend it with a shield and sword in hand"
​ @ARIV4RSAL  keep coping hoyoshill
​ @ARIV4RSAL there is nothing impossible in hoyoverse game btw
 @KamiNoMaho1  and yet you have a hoyo game as ur pfp weird-
"Yes its sa
D to see this take effect to my fav game i ever play 😢😢😢"
@ u sound pressed 💀 is ppl being critical abt things they like an issue to you? are you 12?
"​ @FacelessStarCarver ur crazy, both characters have huge fanbase and I think jade has even bigger than aglea.

There are like no characters in hsr from 5 star roster that don't have big fanbase"
​ @Franceee___ Leaks say that phainon will be next character to have global passive so idk
"@ I guess we’ll have to wait and see what they come up with, but I doubt it’ll be something like a 5% CD increase or a 10% speed buff."
@ let’s wait and enjoy the game in the meantime then!
"dude its literally just a revive, most endgame users aren't going to NEED her to do endgame content. so many people getting upset at qol characters that have skills that aren't gamebreaking if ur not dying every battle??? like oh no, a character with a passive ill probably only use once a blue moon, so broken. if ur dying often enough for her passive to be used enough to be considered game breaking, that's literally just you having a skill issue. maybe use a healer that's built, maybe use a shielder that's built."
Me a GGZ player: First TIme?
​ @ARIV4RSAL  there's leaks about 3 characters that have a global passive increasing stats already lmao
There already have 2 incoming characters that has global passive too according to leaks.
"​ @Franceee___  not to scare you, but Phainon, Cyrene and the Limited Character from Fate collab (probably Saber) is already rumored to have Global passives.

So you're not waiting long for another global passive comes. If the rumors are true."
"​​ @zard2341  bro, you just compared a mechanic best used to farm materials in overworld or SU to one that applies in endgame. There's a reason why acheron's mechanic wasn't controversial, because at best it's a QoL for SU, same for feixiao's or Sparkles'. It's pretty different, you can only relate them that way if you are stupid. And i think you are. 

They are breaching the endgames with this passive, and now sets a standard for the next shiny basic b""t""h after castorice. Had it been outside of endgame and only when cast is in the team, like EVERY OTHER QOL MECHANIC IN THE GAME, trust me no one will complain."
" @Pepegaphone--  a QoL is QoL, regardless where you use it,  and i can argue that simulated is also an endgame as it has repeatable content and reward and is constantly getting update, but every 120 days instead of every month like moc, and it is the best place for acheron technique to use

Just WHAT IS the benefit of having one time revive that can't be used without sustain? if you don't play sustain then your character would be dead on the next turn, if you play good sustain and still dead, i can assure you it is a build issue, if there is a boss that is getting released and able to killed you even with good sustain, then the boss are the one that is concerning, so then the only time it's actually matter is IF an RNG fked you over once every battle like if hoolay hit one character 4 times in a row, castorice passive don't increase your ceiling of your run just the way global stat boost does, it just save you from restarting a run if that 1% (its actually 0,3%🤓) RNG chance do happen

IF you're concerned that this would be a precedent, then i literally show you how acheron, which mind you, the anniversary unit, is still the only one that can one shot, why do you think we can't have talent for one shot elite? or boss? or weekly? it literally doesn't matter for endgame according to you but it's still a big QoL right? it literally the same thing as comparing castorice global buff with like 100% cdmg or something, it's not comparable whatsoever, you can comeback and flame me if that indeed happen, but i can't see a world where they implement global buff that isn't just QoL"
"@ also the leaks are fake, i can say so because ubatcha, one of the most reliable leaker said the fate collab are hunt and nihility, while uncle tiitanoba or whoever it is that i never even heard of, said that saber is remembrance, it's still a leak and up to you for who to believe but i have to say you're more stupid to take some random leaker that no one knows about than ubatcha which has been proven right more often than not"
@SilverArrow10 cmiiw but I heard that the passive doesn't work in MoC? I could be wrong given how the beta had about 6 updates
"@sweeleongng333 let me guess, Phainon and Cyrene?"
@ I guess I’ll just enjoy the game as long as it’s still fun then

"Stat boosts will never happen for global passive, it permanently ruins some relic sets 4p effects"
Just admit you have skill issues

It's not... It's literally slap in the Face...

"​@Ennryuo  if you genuinely think you're forced to pull for a character, then that's just your gambling addiction speaking"
Can't wait for you to complain about a character giving everyone 5 spd globally and you don't have the pulls to get them 😂
 @Catsume  I’m someone that wouldn’t complain about anything and I don’t see that happening pulling the character isn’t even necessary if you don’t want the character
finally someone that gets it
You must have the worst luck if you need $600 for a C1 😂
"At the end of the day, if you can clear endgame content, you don't need it. people can be so dense to this point.
Edit: At the end of the day, will you still play the game, regardless? That's the question you should be asking rather than creating needless drama. That's how dense you guys are."
"It’s honestly not a bad but also not a good thing, all I can say"
"Most of the complaints are from western side, not many people care in the china or Japan or s.Korea it’s mostly just X."
resurection skill is not bad but if skill give immortality that is the real op skill
"I mean, it does help a little to actually deal with the power creep, a buff that remains even when the character itself has become too weak to use in newer teams makes it so it doesnt feel like a waste to pull it"
"Ultra smaaaashhhhhh castorice, next 🥵"
"I love how people randomly say “This game sucks cause is pay to win”. A game needs to have two things to be pay to win: it has to be a PVP game (let’s say Fortnite) and a shop where you can shop immense buffs. HSR it’s not Pay to win (no PVP), a game like Fortnite it’s not pay to win. A game like Clash Royale is pay to win"
To be honest if it was just if she was on the team I think it would be fine. I'm still rolling for her but that decision was made when she was first revealed.
"If you are like strong enough, you literally can;t die so theres no use of the revive, its not like it buffs crit rate or crit dmg.
However, the argument that this allows hoyo to do more stuff like this in the future which can probably buff atk or crit makes sense, so ig we can only hope they dont do that and that this is the first and last one ig"
"I was gonna say at first the it was similar to bailu as she revives a teammate once per battle, but then it said it happend even if she isn't in the party"
5.0 global passive will let you insta clear moc
"The problem is not the passive itself as other people think. Its the fact that they might get away with it and add more characters but with other effects 
Like dmg boost or healing Over time

Castorice’s passive is actually bad when you think about it
Revive with one hp. But think about how will upcoming characters global passive will be if hoyo got away with it"
"Finally, something to make me go cold turkey on this game"
"It's a precedent for something worse in the future, but it shouldn't stop you from enjoying the game right now. 
Had people telling me, ""Don't let the anniversary rewards deter you bro. Remember the global passive.""

I'll keep pushing them to address this issue, but I'll give credit where it's due."
X’s complains= sleep
"Even if it is lore accurate... I'm not good with that. Not only because of castorice, we could partially ignore that because dying is kind of skill issue or lack of farming (no offense) and in the end unless you have bad luck it won't change the good runs... the problem will be even worse when they add global passives that increases things like ATK or HP"
For me it just feels like we got destruction blessing outside SU and DU lol
I already was gonna get castorice since there only character character has revive kit not counting self revive but other then that I see it as bonus for character I like
"Some will be sad, some will be happy life goes on. Anyway E1 Ruan mei WOOHOO"
Bailu got power creep even though she's not the best.
"By the time your dumbass won’t even be able to clear story boss because  of hp inflation or end game mode having a boss that has a attack that can one hit ko you which is literally nikado btw hm and so many future global passive like crit rate and damage, hp boost, all res pen literally if you miss any of them your account is literally weaker than everyone else"
You lack future vision
+ lack problems comprehension skill
Nah if the end game content caters to their global buffs what you going to do?
 @chrono732  ‪Here come the fucking glazers like star rail universe1 and many more that will glaze this global passive when it a bad thing and spoilers the next few characters has crit rate and crit damage and another has hp boost global passive so yh the game is officially cooked ‬
"Here's the thing, you can't 

I tried clearing moc with dot team, all e0s0 hyper investment 

173 spd rm with 180 be
153 spd kafka (163 in battle) with 3.4k atk (s5 gnsw)
154spd (164 in battle) bs with 120 ehr and 3.4k atk
151 spd (161 in battle) 4.4k def aventurine

And it took 11 cycles to clear the first side, there's ABSOLUTELY a problem if I can't clear endgame with all 4 limited untis that I pretty much used 400 pulls to get them"
"I used to be able to clear end game content, but I cant anymore because I havent pull new units, u are the dense one for not seeing the problem."
How ironic cause you’re actually the dense person in this case. You seriously don’t think these global passive will affect future endgame content?
" @vinzolaguer2943  At the end of the day, will you still play the game, regardless? That's the question you should be asking rather than creating needless drama. That's how dense you guys are."
" @Catsume  11 cycle, that's 2 stars no? still considered clearing, not unlike getting defeated or getting 0 star."
 @cloudchaser21  that seems to be your problem. how is it everyone elses?
" @chrono732  that's an INSANE amount of cope, I didn't give those characters 100 HOURS of work building them , AND another 400 just to get the pulls and only clear with 2 stars. (may I remind you I clear ONLY THE FIRST SIDE WITH 11 CYCLES.)"
" @Catsume  I wonder who's coping here? The one complaining or the one enjoying the game LOL. I don't pull all the time but I still clear endgame with 1-2 stars. Aiming for 3 stars and then complaining you're not getting it and saying you need the current characters, that's coping."
 @chrono732  I quit and keep doomposting this game🤣🤣🤣🤣
 @chrono732  maybe I gonna make a content about this game how bad it is after I quit 🤣 so a dense people like you will be so mad🤣
" @chrono732  you know you're pretty much coping yourself with ""oh everything is fine!"". Get real 💀💔"
" @Catsume  I pretty much accepted I won't be getting every unit or LC, and I'm still able to clear most game modes adequately. You, instead, are crying foul on things you think you need to clear the game. This game is literally F2P, not P2W. That is as REAL as it gets. The sooner you get that, the better your life will be. Do not bother replying since it's clear you refuse to acknowledge who is actually coping in a F2P game."
" @chrono732  my life never been better than before after taking breaks from these bloodsucking games, having the time and money to play better games like elden ring. What you do here is mindless consuming, you just eat whether put on to your table like a fucking dog. While here I am having quality time with characters I love and want the best for them while the devs ruin it by making them not be able to clear content or directly make other characters better to such a degree that it feels bad to even use them. Get the characters you want or don't I don't give a literal fuck 💔, but what I'm gonna do is complain so the devs will push themselves to become better while you're going out like a zombie, eating the very shit you lay on ground everyday. Oh and also don't bother replying cuz you're useless in a sense that matters, go with defending your multimillion dollar company 🫶"
"I find the community to be a bit hard sometimes.

If you can clear story content that’s already okay. I straight up don’t understand meta slaves and their continuously running loudspeakers."

If you never spoken to a Chinese player on BiliBili, you'd think it was sunshine and rainbows over there when it's clearly not"
" @Danny-mp8dq  oh good sir if that was the case then hoyo would be singing a different language because 80% of the player base is Chinese. To be exact 14 million players, so if the Chinese players actually retaliated in a large number the live stream would have turned out to be different. They care about their Chinese players more then your expecting so ironically you are naive to think that they wouldn’t care about their biggest player base. 
Edit: “IF” they actually retaliated in a large scale, but they haven’t….yet."

"""They're giving me candy now, but poisoning me later, so it's okay."""
"being single player doesnt suddenly make paying for power not a problem you know.  why do you think people get angry when assassins creed puts too much qol behind a paywall?  the main thing about making a global passive is that it opens up the possibility of more global passives, and once you release something like a crit dmg global passive, it raises the overall health pool of bosses.  if this was zzz i would trust it a little more since their hp inflation is very low, but hsr has shown time snd time again theyre willing to make bosses ultra tanky to non new characters.  btw i dont play hsr anymore so i am only going by what others say, but theres a reason why i dont play it anymore, these days i got ZZZ and it feels way more fair and allows me to even use corin, one of the worst characters in game, to clear content."
All that mental gymnastics just cape for the game.
"This is a horrible argument. By this logic, Diablo Immortal isn't p2w because it's PvE"
"​ @authenticinari-fox8164  Ubisoft drops a game that let's you unlock the entire map's collectibles for $9.99, and everybody loses their minds 

Hoyoverse crashes their own meta every month and people eat it up everytime"
" @authenticinari-fox8164  so let me get this straight 

People complain when Ubisoft lets you pay to unlock the entire map for $10, but somehow, are okay with this?"
Okay that's a bad take cause P2W can exist in single player games. The whole point of P2W is just paying for an easy advantage. And let's say they add a character who will increase SPD by 10 then another comes with crit boosts etc etc and let's just remember end game content is scaled by the newest characters coming out and unless you got a big bank it's gonna be an immediate disadvantage and alot harder cause the developers want you to get your bank out to have a better easier time like PvP so your argument just falls flat
 @Danny-mp8dq  Everyone is fine with Hoyoverse does it for some reason
Its just another pros on why we get her
​@randomviewer112 nope
"​@randomviewer112and then more characters with similar global passives come out and u can't keep up with rolling them, making you miss out on important account buffs

Phainon, Cyrene etc atk hp aspd global buff incoming"
"​ @iliveforchips1186 yeah its not an issue for them coz theyre getting her and shes really popular. Imagine they put a broken passive on a mid male character with mid design, mid personality, mid kit in battle but broken passive? People will riot lol"
@ only then will they realize that their little queen of death wasn't so special after all lmao
"another thing is that they may just add more 1 shot mechanics to bypass current levels of survivability, and her passive existing emboldens them to put them in."
"Not only that but unlike Bailu, this can ressurrect multiple people at once."
& Bailu can only per once by revive them
Or 2x if she has e6
imo it should only be if she is in the team and party. having it be passive does sound very P2W
I thought bailing can revive once per ultimate?   Was I wrong
yes you are mistaken
" @uncoollotus9603   Ah yes, The other incarnation of Dan Feng, Bailing"
​ @genesys3357  so is Fu Xuan js non existence?
HAHA limbus company already succeed with this with support passive
​ @Scarycandyman must be nice 👍
"And she is a fking dps btw, that’s suppose to be Abundance job btw, Castorice is just every role smash into a mess of a character"
​ @genesys3357  fu Xuan E2 can revive the whole team
Literally just had the exact same thought process
"and you can expect this skill but it's de/buff the next time it reappears in the future

hsr has become a disgrace to all turn-based game ever made"
@riojaneiro4130 I'm Not doomposting and Just judge when it's Released
Oh no! She's better than a trash standard 5 star! What ever will we do?!
​ @Scarycandyman KOLIJANARI sneak 🔥🔥🔥
"The revive Only Works If you heal the unit back. If you have a unit during in your team, your are either sustainless or having massive skill issues."
" @BailuGaming  Right because of course we dont already have a bunch of characters with passive and mass healing/shielding if you get them to a high enough constellation and their lightcones. They got powercrept so they dont matter. Hoyoverse got the playets covered, new 5 stars that just so happen to play off Castorice like Hyacine. Hyacine the remembrance healer who happens to increase her personal damage based off of the amount of life drain inflicted on teamates and memo spirits. She has an amazing light cone that causes even more life drain and, if you get her next constellation, that personal damage outscales Mydei. Did I mention she's a healer? Because she heals like Loucha but better."
 @ivamuyargas1885 Ese inglés esta mal
It also revives any teammate that gets downed if I'm not mistaken where as Bailu is a 1 and done.
​@TypeMoonFanSashi Considering the leads doomposting may be appropriate as there are apparently already 4 others characters that are planned to have global passives. In other words the power creep which is already really bad is about to get much worse.
"Bring bailu as healer, and you get 2 revives. 3 with her e6"
 @Scarycandyman  my bro does not understand what global means 😭
"LMAO
I remembered how some npcs or someone sold fake(i think they were romantic..?) journals about legendary Dan Fang and Jimm Yuang🗣️🗣️

 ​ @heppelhopv2 "
LOL
Coming back to this in 2 years and will probably be true
" @notcbt1987  hey if it gets added then just pull the character never upgrade them and call it a day, maybe people can finally clear moc12 for once in their life"
"that would be great though.... that mean even lvl 1 player can clear it, now people still having hard time clearing moc12"
"Honestly I highly doubt there will be any more global passives, and if there are I also highly doubt it will be related to damage(Please let this comment age well)"
 @FoxYuushaZ oh my.. i hope this is satire
 @Im_Motivated-Ayato  yes because everyone is a whale who just have the funds to get everyone in the game. What type of dumbass logic is this
tbf Acheron did it first she doesnt even have to get into battle just smack em dead (elite enemies aside)
Don't give them ideas🤣
​ @FoxYuushaZ  No way f2p players can win every 50/50
womp womp cybaby
Will never happen (and ofc lemme joke too ok)
"no need 5.0, new global passive available on 3.4 according to leaks."
LMAOOO
@Battlebro8leaks for the fates collab is that all the characters have global passives. It’s the president that this sets that people are upset about and they are likely going to go though with it and destroy all the good will they had with their community
"Hoyo will do this for sure, a true zero cycle 😂"
Cut the crying bullshit.
collect all global passive then just press auto 😂
And all of the whaler will cry I guess 🤣
"They’ll add characters like this regardless of people’s opinions, anyway. It’d be great if HoYo listened to criticism from the people who fund their game."
"Come on man, are you forgetting that they’re also buffing up the enemy’s as well ? Like The upcoming boss will completely ignore the defence and shield and I’m sure there will be more enemies who will be even more powerful in the future."
 @glooze  cuz they know people will still play regardless
"What about new whale system? NPC still looks like shit, characters yapping like robots, lack of events, less rewards... Hoyo cares only about milking players"
@ yeah you are right and the hp inflation is going to be wild. Im imagining in 4.x or plus. New bosses hp’s will be 20M average. In the overworld
@ these are other problems with the game but my comment was about the predatory global passive. Im not ignoring these problems tho
As long as CN is satisfied. They ain't doing shit😂
statwise buffs out of battle from global passives could happen but its not gonna be on all chars in a team/account and its not gonna be must pull also shes an anniversary character shes gonna be op obviously
 @hyperscalerafsan8913  as long as CN keeps sucking off Hoyoverse*
Naw her ability is op say your entire team gets wiped at once. She can bring them all back to life. Now usually an attack like that would give characters back a lot of energy so your healer should have their heal up to get everyone up and they should have ults to counter attack
​ @ARKed069  quite agread with you bro
"Her passive is not bad in the slightest. It's extremely overpowered to be a global passive. If your whole team gets wiped at the same time, they all come back. 1 HP does not matter because they also become immune to death until they are healed or get a shield. So the passive itself IS part of the problem."
" @XenoWars  I mean it might be good for early game accounts, but for established accounts? I don't think it's that crazy, my characters rarely dies in endgame content."
"Death is something thats related her character, so it only makes sense. If you’re not happy with it don’t pull, same goes for following characters with similar passives."
@ ermmm. I love the character so much. She is actually my favorite hsr character. And im saving for her and her light cone. And I actually pulled for tribbie just for her ( shocking right? ). I just dont suppor this global passive. So get this idea out of your mind. Yes i will not pull if i didnt like the character. But she is a character that i love and want
They better not pull off that shit on ZZZ or else imma quit that game too. Its better to call it out now before other  gachagames copy this predatory tactics
 @ARKed069 that’s exactly the problem tho. You can’t make a solution to absurd hp inflation and enemy buffs only available to people who pull for a specific character especially since it’s rlly not guaranteed you will manage to get said character even if you saved up for a long time and only rich ppl who spend on this game and want to get her are guaranteed to benefit from it it isn’t fair
"@ bro I’m an f2p player and me and many others have been saving from quite a while the buff and everything you mentioned is specifically in the DU or SU or other end games and those buffs are still available for HP scaling characters like blade or Mydei. The only difference is how good is your team and your build the character, it’s a skill issue rather then hoyo issues, there is no absolute rule that if you don’t follow the meta you can’t do anything or you’ll lose everything."
 @mysteriousweebx7037  she can bring one back to life  once per battle
@ No she has multi Rez look at the video Mihoyo played. She revives both TB and tribbie
Imagine in next anniv character when we get them our characters can't die again ☠️
Ya'll too young to over think and worry
"In optimal scenario imagine your healer is just 1 energy away from ult, without cas pass they will die but with cas passive they
will get the energy and heal to remove the passive and completely revived. So its not that bad its just make every sustain has a bailu passive with some restrictions."
"​ @zayed-q5x  Is her passive disadvantage to you ? If not, then pull, if it is (I doubt) then don't pull. There's no need for too much hate for global passive since it only gives advantage to your account and if you don't pull for a unit with global passive, there's no disadvantage."
hsr has become a disgrace to all turn-based game ever made
 @hyperscalerafsan8913  Hoyo does not listen to them either. People did complain about the passive in chinese serves if I aint wrong.
This is something that Genshin is already implementing if leaks are to be believed with Escoffier. It’s not going away.
"They definitely won't do damage boost and healing overtime, tho phinon will have a global passive with the day and night mechanic"
" @felinedreamer1685  yeah I heard that too, when the beta was going on the mainland player were complaining oo"
" @justdome354 
and the 1680 skins"
You can just always quit the game
"I highly doubt they'll start handing out global passives like candy to multiple characters. Castorice is an anniversary character, every gacha game in history has always given the anniversary units insanely broken kits.

Last year we got Acheron who had had crazy dmg with a technique that literally lets you skip entire battles. If for some reason they do decide to add another global passive I feel like it'd be for another anniversary in like 2-3 years, by then I imagine we'll have so many reruns of her & enemies so strong that we'll look back & realize this wasn't really that deep. 

I get the skepticism but I genuinely think this passive will be unique to her & everyone's just jumping the gun & assuming the worst"
"@iori3325  there's leaks about 3 characters in 3.X will have Global Passive, some of them are Stats buff and some of them are Traces buff"
​​ @ARKed069  The answer to powercreep is to not add even more powercreep and p2w mechanics lmao. Do you even hear yourself??
"Nigga what??? That is the most paranoid and sociopathic cope to validate immature responses. The revive is just 1 hp and doesn't immediately make the allies get their turn. THEY HAVE TO HEAL TO NOT STAY DEAD AND IT'S ONCE. 1!!

Y'all latch onto one thing and blow it up like Karens. Actually, nah. You ARE the Karens."
"​ @glooze Fund their game, not a single western country is under the top 10 most players or revenue countries...

They do listen, the people they dont listen to just think they speak for the majority...

They do care for Western players, met devs and employees myself but... it feels like bad faith screaming when i see its people 0 cycle moc when i cant even clear  it entirely at all..."
"Bye. Nobody will miss you, and if you aren't a spender hoyo won't miss you either"
"Man, just full quit HSR at this moment. The Armaggeddon is just begun now. This will get much worser than you imagine."
"​ @minuteman21 
Already done 
Just moved to t9
And I'm having tons of fun"
" @eliatomasi2620 genuinely happy for you, cuz i also quit hoyoverse games not too long ago (hsr and zzz, cuz i already quit genshit 2 years ago) at around 3.0 of honkai star rail."
" @eliatomasi2620 

T9 is actually very beginner friendly in endgame despite being hard"
I would at least just keep checking out the story then and there
Goodbye!
Honestly with how stale the game has gotten I was just waiting for an excuse to finally drop it
Okay see ya. We don't want whiny babies anyway
@ and we don’t wanna play a gacha game that has to amplify their already existing predatory tactics by 100%. Good riddance HSR
"im scared for statwise buffs but im not saying the game is dying over a single passive, ik global passives will never ever make chars must pulls unless its a sustaining global passive and ur a sustainless team user but that's it and people calling it powercreep don't know what powercreep means"
I cant enjoy the game when my Black Swan/Kafka team that used to be able to clear all MoC hit like wet noodle now...
All I can hear are skill issues from the players
" @freyrisulfr4139 all I hear is ignorance and media illiteracy from you. Nobody hates this passive because it helps skill issue, they hate it because of the precedent it sets. Leaks already confirm future characters will also have these passives so it seems like our “doom posting” wasnt just us saying shit for attention"
"I will just not pull for castorice, im letting her rot. Ill rather go for Jiaoqiu and his Lc  and maybe anaxa just cuz I like the design but if they release anything else like castorice im not pulling them."
"THIS ‼️ this is why I just filter out the complaints bc honestly ppl in hoyo games complain about so many things. I'll just be here enjoying the game, thanks"
"​ @ronreed4050  this is like genshin and other gacha games, the more you character releases the more power crept will be, because that's how the industry works 

Seele is now irrelevant on moc without proper build  and support. (And other og meta) 
New characters 5 star = new meta and new meta will be broken and new enemy will tougher 
You can't stay at it forever because someone can't cope with it and also you are exploring new planets on every update = new tougher enemy and mechanics
They follow the genshin formula update (or generic gacha) 
So don't even surprise by it 🤦🏻‍♂️"
I don't enjoy doing dailies and use energy for months.
" @ronreed4050  And that's why you should learn when it's sarcasm 🤣 
You're too serious lil bro"
"I stopped playing since the release of Yunli. Deleted the game from my phone, PC, and PS5. It's not enjoyable anymore for me by that time. Terrible powercreep, utterly terrible writing, and almost no effort to balance the game at all. Just clicked here because I was curious how the game worsened over time. I went back to the F2P game that actually reworks and rebalances their old characters and no gacha at all."
​ @agnesfodornevarga7702 I'd recommend singleplayer games. Persona is a similar turn-based game and its quite a lot of fun.
"​ @Anikun_2 sadly, its not that similar to genshin for one simple reason:
Genshin is so easy of a game that every character in 1.0 can defeat every type of content from the game, just not as easily as the recent characters. Meanwhile, try using Seele on the recent Moc 12... She wont do anything there."
​ @ronreed4050 is a global passive disadvantage to your account ?
"Yeah that's real and the problem is HOYOVERSE is gatekeeping the characters with rng and rerun system. I ~know~​ play a game with WORSE powercreep, the rarity system is basic one (common, rare, epic+, legendary+) and everytime a new legendary+ released the last legendary character is DEMOLISHED from the meta BUT the dev gives enough rewards (from farming, mail, events, etc.) for the player to get the character,what I mean is the character is 100% free, so the garage system (rate up one) is have a guarantee to get the rate up character at 250 pull but the dev makes F2P can reach that amount and it's not that hard (for newer player it's still considered as hard for me, that's why this game is not really noob friendly) and the normal legendaries are mostly free, even they added an event (not anniversary) when you streak login for 20 days you can CHOOSE one of all the legendaries that already released at that time for FREE, even they added a perma event where we can choose 1 ancient (a rarity that above legendary)for each phase, there's total of 3 phase Wich mean 3 ancients out of 5 ancients! But HOYOVERSE doesn't do the same they make the gacha more harder while making the Powercreep insaner (for me it's only one step away to reach the powercreep of that game I've played) the game name is CRK (It's just an abbreviation) it's kinda popular now, so I'm sure there's a lot of people recognizing this game nowadays  @silverstar1614 "
 @cloudchaser21  so because of it you chose to cry about this on the Internet?
"​ @silverstar1614  its actually the same already, do you see klee as in dps on the spiral abyss 12-3? 💀 (Like eveyone can do that?) Or even worst fremi physical dps.
What i meant is the more games update the more it gets harder little by little 
So i didn't suprised because that's how gacha game works lol."
"@Anikun_2  I am also not surprised, but like Genshin is VERY different with their Spiral Abyss 12th floor difficulty. Thats literally the one and only thing that they make it total bullshit and hard. Meanwhile, the entire game, story, archon quests, everything that you NEED to do to complete the game's content beside the Abyss can be easily beaten with any Character, including Klee.
Honkai Star Rail, meanwhile, already started its insane Difficulty spike when that Boss that came with Ruan Mei was launched. Every update, a new boss comes that will be so difficult that the single character they launch in that version will be NEEDED to pass trough it. Unless they make Casual mode EVEN MORE casual (as i heard that they made this casual mode so ppl can pass trough the story)."
"​ @silverstar1614  the problem is the whale will whine again, or meta slave savers (goldfish spender) 
Or
Mihoyo wants some cash 

Its no in between. I don't know what's their cooking but all games have recently hard for me as f2p 
They burning the kitchen if this thing continues (which is definitely are)
And about klee you can't beat the last spiral abyss and now because the given health on boss and  elite enemies are insane, also the infuriating part that only natlan characters can benefit on the buff (last time spiral abyss)

So in the end they are definitely the same. Spiking there and that


Also ZZZ the last event i didn't even beat it 💀
Its like mihoyo wants u to be whale or fish for some reason"
"@Anikun_2  Again, you repeated the same thing that i said we shouldnt focus on when comparing the powercreep between Hsr and Genshin.
You are indeed correct with everything you said, but i am trying to point out how Hsr is being way worse with it than genshin:
Abyss and Moc have the same problem, but what differentiate between Genshin powercreep and Hsr powercreep is the story bosses. The last boss we saw can be defeated by ANY character or any team. Will struggle more than the optimal team? Yeah, ppl will. But its way easier than how much someone with only 1.0 characters fight last story boss on hsr. So much so Hsr had to make Casual mode, but genshin has nothing like that."
"​ @silverstar1614  i said the problem is the whale is gonna whine again or mihoyo wants a spare cash to grab in
That's why there's many space between it because it's different sentence 
It means that hoyo listen on the whale or people that wants the game harder

This common trend before the spikes 
""I can solo the moc"" 
""Only one character on moc"" 
""Is there no real end game for hsr?"" (This the most i always see)

The thing is community ask for this then regret later."
"​ @silverstar1614  and false also 
The thing is that spiral abyss is time dependant only one stage are health dependant, which means that if you need to be good on this and wise pulling
But other than that 
Its already presence on the surface area of genshin you just didn't notice 

You will not get the primo if you don't have the meta in spiral abyss, and if there's a new character releases automatically the buff on spiral abyss will align on that character or whatever character on that banner, only 5.x has buffs on spiral abyss that is so specific , unlike before so argue with me if they aren't milking both games including ZZZ using difficulty spike and character gimmick lock stage."
those replies originating from Twitter told me all I need to know
But it’s all over hoyolab too
"Complaining, Twitter 🤬
Complaining, China 🤩"
Brother these complaints exist on HoYoLAB too. Not to mention it’s Chinese and Japanese players criticizing this as well.
 @Danny-mp8dq  u know why? Bc most of income come from china not western lol
"@donquixotedoflamingo6645  glazing gang 

Hoyoverse doesn't listen to anyone 🥀"
" @Danny-mp8dq  try zzz then comeback, btw hoyoverse never listen to western only china so stop hopping they will listen to you if you not from chinese lol"
 @ronreed4050  oh i should say western not X lol
"If Hoyoverse really cared about lore accuracy, then he shouldn't be allowed to die, and Jingliu should always fight on auto"
"I will said that just an excuse by the Dev to make more money... 
Even in Honkai Impact 3...there is character named Seele who literally have a Title Herscher of Death/Rebirth (Death Authority)...she can not Revive the Death Character both in Story/Lore and Gameplay...."
You are thinking too small. What if they add a character who increases your team size from 4 to 5 or doubles the energy regen rate of your team just by existing.
acheron in the side with insta kill ability 😐
 @mysteriousweebx7037 at this point you are just delusional
"Instakill is only for overworld and su/du. Castorice's passive affects MOC, PF and AS. ​ @jawbonedis "
"​ @mysteriousweebx7037 so we are all living in ""whatifs?"""
​ @jawbonedis  Does it work in the endgame? Does it work when she's not in the party?
 @sumagestad4962  i mean if u consider DU an endgame then yes and the guy said its suppose to be lore accurate
​@jawbonedis  DU is a for fun endgame that isn't meant to be a massive challenge. All rewards are collectible by just farming the lowest difficulty on vii. Your characters naturally become stronger than the enemies if you put any thought into it. Any higher difficulty can be done using preservation handedly. Also who even goes into combat domains in DU?
 @jawbonedis fr
So is it a disadvantage to your account ?
" @xeenooo  ok a lot of comments, let me see

Is not strictly a disadvantage, but is not strictly a game changer too, if you are good playing and you have good builds, it would be hard to notice it. Increasing stats would be noticeable instantly"
" @mysteriousweebx7037  those are other dangerous options, but I said ATK and HP because if I recall correctly, they were kind of leaked. Still, a leak,  you don't need to trust me in that thing but is what I know"
" @Danny-mp8dq  Jingliu fighting on Auto is actually possible, Mydei does that xD"
" @muhammadhanry7907  Yeah, that's sad. An also I think castorice is one of the most popular characters of 3.x (if not the top 1) so possibly they're doing this to get even more money from people that doesn't have interest in her at first..."
 @Dlex84  So what is really the problem if it is not a disadvantage ?
" @jawbonedis  that's not a problem. Acheron skill is a technique, SHE MUST activate it, and it only works with normal enemies on field, thing that doesn't appear in endgame modes like MoC or PF. Castorice revive thing is a passive skill that even activates when she's not in your team. You can get her pity 0, have her at level 1 and that passive will still apply"
 @Dlex84  i only say it because it was related on the topic that u said about being lore accurate
" @jawbonedis  that's true, but the skill is not the same, Acheron does not affect inside battle xd"
" @Dlex84  yeah, he just cancel this fight in general🙂"
Well not everyone wants to be super competitive in a single player game
"@anael5265  yup I know, but is still a serious damage this"
"That's very Karen logic. ""Oh no they added one crazy new idea and now it looks like nothing will stop them from changing everything so radically unless I stop them."" 🙄

Every nigga saying it's bad for the game needs to calm the fuck down and actually see how it goes when it drops. And for anyone who argues ""oh well it forces the character to be a must pull"" let me remind you that you have something called A CHOICE NOT TO GET THE FUCKING CHARACTER. 😂😂

It's a fucking choice dudes. Y'all acting like the Russian government when something new comes out. Like you gotta gatekeep availability or something. Karens."
So is thr problem u cant show off beating moc owning castorice or just the fear that people wont be able to 0 cyvce it because i cant fully beat moc or any of these timed modes... So castorice would certainly help... cause i get sometimes oneshot anyway already... and cant remember how many 100+ runs i did for a single relic Set after i just kept what i got...
Honestly if they want lore accuracy they could have just made it into a story unlockable global passive. Something like after to her moment in her story she blesses us with something and it helps us in our future troubles. Making it so that the passive only activates when you have her in your account it's just greed
"I just wish it didn't get locked up behind a limited 5 star, like if it was a relic set or new equipment mechanic it would add to the game."
"​ @faturramadhani4770 if you think more, this isn't actually op honestly.. 1 HP can't really save you from enemies bombing. it really depends on your sustain speed. You could die by boss chain attacks or die by creep before your sustain turn."
" @KuroujiUtataha  that's true, but it affects me rn. Like it's force the feeling I should get Castorice over Mydei, and I'm stressing over it."
" @faturramadhani4770  play the game all your way, my friend.. Just enjoy the game with your way without seeing Meta, I honestly play HSR for fun and fill my free time after work"
"​ @KuroujiUtataha you missed the entire point... 
this means future characters will have global passive like giving buff,shield or even Heal... in the End... You won't even need to play Sustain or support anymore...."
"​ @muhammadhanry7907 oh, I didn't think that far.. My bad 😅
But for now we can relief because Castorice passive is not really broken like it seems.."
​ @faturramadhani4770 Getting both is optimal for meta.
​ @faturramadhani4770 State your reason why you want to pull for her and why you wont then compare it.Are you pulling for meta ? character design ? lore ? If you find that you don't have any reason to pull for her then don't force yourself to create a reason to pull for her and blame the game. It's your fault not theirs.
"​ @faturramadhani4770 why? Why would u stress out because of that 1hp revive? Both mydei and cassie are crazy good enough without that global passive tag. Just choose whoever char that u need the most, that would be good for your long term value and team comp, dont make that global passive become the sole reason u pull for a char"
Eos insight
"I still remember when Silwer Wolf released and many people scared about she can powercrept anything bcs of weakness implant but look now, they still play hsr and keep update every patch lmao😂"
"@Kyaaa-  she wasn't broken she was a tipping point a difference you fail to see, hsr will lose so many content creators it's insane"
 @KingJ-the1  for now yup but in her first released she's absolutely broken bruh bcs she have unique kit to counter almost all enemy and people keep overreacting like now but look at SW now😂 no one cares about her and see her as fine character lol
"@Kyaaa-  you again lack the ability to comprehend beyond base value, I'll break this down for you 

Silver wolf was the beginning of the end her weakness implant started to take away the strategy away from the strategy game.

Now multiple units ignore weakness types, anaxa implants all 7 weaknesses, castorice does everything possible.

And there will get to a point where castorice is seen as a horrible unit I personally don't think the game will live that long but whatever.

The global passives is taking away the players choice and is practically forcing you to pull characters with global passives"
" @KingJ-the1  SW was still a broken character before, remember that no one cares about the meta bcs as long as they have SW and mono quantum team, they literally can defeat any enemy. About global passive characters it's not a must pull tho no one forces u to pull the character u don't want, it's all about the build. With the right build even 4* characters(like Xueyi) can easily beat the MoC"
@Kyaaa-  beat moc 10 and 12 with her not using new supports
She was powercreept when healers could remove debuffs from allies with skills and other mechanics.
Not only Bailu..... Fu Xuan is also got power creep by her Pet (Dragon) who can take the Team members damage....
I all in
Yh anyone that supports this dumb because guess what the next global passive characters has to do with damage and something else which I won’t say since it leaks but yh the fomo will be insane
Something similar to this is present in Azure Lane btw I am not sure but this isn't the first time something like this is made
Im surprised you didnt cover this earlier
All in as in you support this? Do you realise this is gonna be the snowball effect right? Powercreep and fomo is already bad as it is and by encouraging this it's only gonna get worse
 @teddyisaliar271  I’m pretty sure HoYo doesn’t listen to criticism from fans. This is very apparent in genshin for example.
"@teddyisaliar271  I not support that matter, I just want to pull her. Also I f2p player and rarely play in moc or pure fiction."
"​ @teddyisaliar271  As f2p that has been clearing all endgame since 1.2, idgaf about this update at all cause im enjoying the game regardless. There are many gachas out there that are more p2w than this with Pvp content in it, at least HSR doesnt."
" @pillowhead4456  And there is the problem just cause you think it's okay doesn't mean it is okay it's still a problem and you just ignored the point of what it means for the potential future. If you can't actually acknowledge the broader situation then let me out it like this. If you are a new player good luck, if you are a returning player too bad your characters are outdated and unless you have the relics given to you by the hand of god best of luck. And with global passives it's gonna get to the point where unless you have a specific character you are always gonna be at an immediate disadvantage and with the constant meta changing the awful hp inflation, the so called ""class roles"" being completely irrelevant now it doesn't set a good example and using the excuse of well others games it's bad and they have PvP is literally a terrible scapegoat excuse cause it's still a problem so trying to deflect just shows you are aware of it and just don't want to acknowledge. If what you say is true then why is the star rail community actually uniting and saying this isn't a good thing and they really need to rethink this over and not been happy with her current state of the game recently?"
kinda ironic to say people are dumb while you are worried a literal game's future as if you cant play it in the future
@ are you dumb this is how we were coping that castorice won’t come to live but look at where we are
 @mlacc5020  people used to think Silver Wolf was powercreep proof 3 years ago
People keep saying just damage but you are thinking too small. What if the be global passive allows you to have 5 characters on a team ?
 @mysteriousweebx7037 we can already have 8 characters on team if they’re all remembrance
@ Mems aren’t characters
​ @mlacc5020 well it's more how much frustration and unfair it's gonna be. Imagine a character comes out who gives 10% crit rate and 15% crit dmg for existing is this the kind of features we should be striving for?
"​ @teddyisaliar271 wow thats crazy, cant wait to get that 🤩, now i can get 0 cycle full auto in any endgame content, sad this game doesnt have leaderboard"
There are no shipgirls that could do that atm. Closest thing is the Operation Siren revive but with debuffs and a free equipment that can keep the shipgirl alive for 10 seconds. One game is a turn based and another is side scrolling danmaku. Entirely different games
"Also correct me if I'm wrong as I do not play AL and certainly would not touch a Hoyo game again with a 10 foot pole.

But AL gives you more rolls for free for technically less effort, so even if an absolutely broken ass character comes out you have a fair chance to obtain it without the need to skip banners or suffer from being fed droplets of currency."
 @Zero001  absolutely. They have a seasonal shop to redeem pulls/cubes using tickets just by running commissions. Commissions run in the background so you’re not incentivised to leave the game open. This happens 2-3 times a year iirc
" @Zero001  absolutely. In 2 to 3 times in a year, they have a seasonal shop where you can redeem pulls/cubes with tickets that you get from running commissions. The commissions can run in the background so you’re not incentivised to leave the game open or play longer. Ironically, it is easier to get a super rare then getting an elite which is an equivalent of four star given that super rare rate is 7%."

Uh oh gigguk ex is here😂 how is wuwa doing with their convention oh yeah its crowded in japan😊
blud really out here pulling all strings just to make hsr less bad. AL is just so different on hsr and the meta there is how big a shipgirls ass and tits are
"There's also something similar to the global passive idea in Fire emblem Heroes, the emblem character gives something to buff one character on each of your team. You might not want the character or think it will be powercreep easily, but just because it can buff anyone in each of your teams you need it no question asked or you're just gonna destroyed by players that got them later on. That was an issue I never saw reported when I was playing FeH but it definitely should have."
He's a Hoyocreator. I don't think he's allowed to cover leaked content.
@vr4893  is he actually partnered with hoyo? Cuz I thought only partnered hoyo cc can't cover leaks
 @win-d. Or maybe just because he doesn’t want to post leaks. That’s it.
"Beta information is inaccurate, so we had to wait for Hoyo to announce whether the passive was global or not, this happened on the live. It was better to wait for confirmation than to spread false information"
If it was Genshin related he'd 100% uploaded it weeks ago. He gets the most views from negative Genshin news
WHY HOYO?? WHY?!
I don’t know if I ever cried this much in my life bro …

I never thought I’d cry after so long especially after seeing this I always thought that I would never cry again but this actually made me cry seeing what Castorice had to go through was enough to break my heart and crush my soul
That was depressingly beautiful
6:00 this part literally made me cry

"Típico de Hoyoverse, te tira un pasado triste y unas migajas de desarrollo para intentar hacerlo lo más profundo posible, pero no estuvo mal, me gustó, tampoco voy a decir guau cinema porque no es así. El de Aventurine va a ser insuperable al parecer, ese sí fue bien desarrollado, pero bueno que más esperar de pretencioso rail"
"To be honest shouldn't be big deal. Mydei is there, he wont die anyway. Blade too"
"2:41

All she really wanted was someone to hold her. To reach out and touch her. To hug her. To be her friend. To stay.
6:29 notice how she doesn’t have any flowers or butterfly motifs (except her choker) when she’s a normal human?
"Lorsque j'ai vu ce court métrage, il y a quelques jours pendant que je jouais... je me suis dis "" waouh, la dinguerie !!! "" L'animation est vraiment bien faite et l'histoire de Castorice est très prenante... Je n'ai pas pu m'empêcher d'avoir de la peine pour elle"

"Bro did not hesitate to put this in game

"I think this is a happy short actually, or rather, one where they come out happier than they entered. Castorice now starts to see death like those who willingly died to her, a warmth."
"I don't know how they did it after Firefly but they gave us Wife 2

I would die for this girl."

You know what's painful there are so much humans who didn't want to touch or be touched due to their family issues and past. they didn't even want to change that. But I would want someone like this switch with ones who can't. I know that she's character and not human. But anyways

(I cried hard watching this)"

"Oh look at that, I've been impaled."
😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Same thing happened with citlali I think hoyo needs a better story
little square face
You know what's wrong with Skyr- imean Hoyo these days? Everyone is obsessed with death!
"Wait, why am I sobbing?"
"я плачу, спасибо.."
Live with no regrets Castorice
"I didn't even believe it was a game. Honestly, make an anime about this girl, it's awesome."
Why did i cry dawg😢
I wonder about blade and mydei.
"I was like: DON'T CRY DON'T CRY DON'T CRY DON'T CRY DON'T CRY DON'T CRY DON'T CRY DON'T CRY DON'T CRY.
And I didn't 😊"
"キャスちゃん良いキャラだ(´;ω;｀)
しし神様も共演するとはｗ"
"That scene when she dancing between a mirror and her shadow, imagine to have friend... It crush me, it crush me hard. 
I need a hug bth...😢"
"Question does she need to eat? If she does, does that mean anything her mouth touches is okay? So we can kiss her? Other than her hands what else can we touch?"
ALL I DO IN THIS FANDOM IS LOSE 50/50 AND CRY 😭
"PLS HOYO RELEASE THAT BACKSOUND 😭😭😭😭🙏,"
Thats why her Global Passive wont let anyone die
Dios santo
I hate crying why do i keep doing this to myself
0:07 may i enter this chat

"This was very informative, appreciate it."
I see onions everywhere
"I never saw in my whole life.....a face stained with both fake happiness and sadness so well animated. Congratulations Hoyoverse, you broke me again...."
💜🖤
Oh look late night depression
DANG IT HOYO!!!!! Why must you make me cry?!!!!! 😭 😭😭😭
"Great tips, thanks for sharing!"
"Great job, this video was very useful!"
I was just eating.... eating and crying😢
"Я не плачу, я рыдаю! 31 годик мать его, вот что значит объятия смерти"
Damn you got me crying while eating my burger 😭
Well this is depressing
5:57 Background Music?
Why is it raining in my room 😭
que gooners amigos consiganse una vida y dejen de jugar gachas
“But big sister Castorice.. your hands are so warm” MY SHAYLAA☹️☹️☹️😭😭😭
"Very well done, appreciate this video!"
"Di channel yg versi JP, ini versi global bro"
"It's too late, we can't stop..."
Embracing death literally
I'LL HUG YOU CASTORICE 😭😭😭
Грустная история конечно. Когда уже михуё начнет полнометражки делать или аниме сериалы...и добавит уже наконец русский язык в  HI3rd.
🥲
I want too hug castorice and be friends ;_;
Absolute cinema
Although bittersweet she needed a hug
Is someone cutting onions??? 5:55

Esse pessoal aí tá cabeçudo demais slk
"Fallen angel

Não acredito que tô chorando 😭😭😭😭
PEAK!!! will be an E6 haver!!
5:48 I actually started crying 😭
Finally something close to arle one!
Мощно конечно...
WOMP WOMP
This is somewhat similar to Citlali's trailer.
oh my god
"I cried so hard but given this is Castorice, it is to be expected, girl doesn't like her abilities but is cursed with loneliness and not being able to be close to people let her powers kill them, causing her endless grief. Still it was beautifully and tragically shown here. Well done Hoyo!"
can u sthu
 @heavenleyxmoon3689  cry
"Me: Good LORD, this poor girl needs a hug.
Trailblazer: Hold my Trashcan."
Why dont you just make an anime at this point? People would love it so much
МНЕ НУЖНО ПРОДАТЬ КАСТОРИЮ... ЛЮБОЙ ЦЕНОЙ!!!
now i want some explication from thanatos... and have a not so calm chat with him
Shaoji really shines with character focus. Penacony was just way too much.
"Se odeia, arranca fora as mãos."
I didn't think I could be made to cry in just 7 minutes.
"I've seen enough, new castorice song coming soon"
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
DAMN..... DAMN........ PURE CINEMA
OH! WELL… I’LL CRY THEN.
"Та, кто владычица смерти
Ценит жизнь больше всех
И желает проводить время с живыми
Больше чем с мёртвыми"
"Ох, это очень сильно! я не могу перестать плакать((( 
Это так больно! Даже не знаю, как теперь прийти в себя..."
"Dios, es súper deprimente!! Y ese venado del final seguro que está tramando algo..."
После таких фильмов не жалко и копеечку в игру вкинуть)
4:55 this part fr made my cry
I love these shorts... such a tear jerker I want to save her
So sad
"Как же это трогательно!
Жестокая судьба для хрупкой девочки.😢"
Я так понимаю музыку из видео не существует? Ибо меня всё игнорят
Blade: Touch me!
Blade: That paradise may be reachable for me.
What a terrible day for a rain....
With how emotional these shorts can be i couldn't imagine how emotional a full on anime series would be! WE NEED AN ANIME SERIES! (Yes I bawled my eyes out to this!)
Nah bro y'all actually got me in tears :face-purple-crying: Another amazing animation from Hoyo!!
Firefly still Top G but this was sweet and thoughtful.
Как же они ее продают
2:43 举杯邀明月，对影成三人
WHY IS IT SO HEARTBREAKING ;-;
AUUUUUGHHHHH😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
CASTORICE MY BABYYYYYYYYY😭😭😭😫😫😫
Wow... Beautiful animation
Noooo why im crying fr 😭😭😭
This greedy company can make nice videos.
So her ability doesn't work on herself? Man this sentence could be a lot worse if i said something else.. 😂
This looks like a freaking anime not a animated short
that thumbnail was a trap...
I need her
"i feel so bad for castorice, even started to cry"

SHIKANOKO NOKO KOSHITANTAN 🗣🗣🗣🦌🦌🦌
Miyabi animated short... And then this...? Hoyo never fails to make us cry.
"I am crying 
I HOPE EVERYONE'S PULLS GO WELL (Jiaoqiu plis come home 😢)"
we got elysia!!!
Great video
I cried
"даже в хентай мангах лучше передают  все стекло долгоживущего человека,особенно девушки, хватит ли сюжета в игре чтоб раскрыт персонажа? не знаю, такой интересный персонаж можно было как то показат,более близкую связь но нет это игра для детей"

Why cant she just revive her with her global passive
"Oh boi, here i go crying again."

2:59 - 3:02 kinda sus 💀
"Я НЕ ЗАХОЖУ ЧТОБЫ ПЛАКАТЬ. при чем изначально скептически, т.к надоели слезливые истории. Умеют хоеверсы в сопли"
❤️❤️❤️
Man hot take but castorice is so mid and boring.. yea I've had some controversial take like hating Robin initially then growing on her but Castorice is just boring hahahaha..  I was never a Seele fan to begin with after all and tell me she's not just a dark type Seele.
my baby just want to hug her friends 😭💔
😭😭😭
xxd
Best
"Сплошная отсылка на аниме ""В лес, где мерцают светлячки"" (Hotarubi no Mori e)"
Seeing her happy and pretending to dance with everyone is kinda soul crushing ngl.

That trailer has been powercrept since FF
@Etty_..   nah  bro. I even forgot that one exist

If they had a anime about HSR I can tell it will go big
6:10 this was so beautiful that tears ran down my cheeks
"Jamás voy a dejar de jugar Honkai Star Rail, siempre me da todo lo quiero tener y ver en un juego."
Anyone else crying?
"dang hoyo, I don't even play Star Rail, why are you hurting me like this T_T"
Damn onion ninjas....

I'm crying... and so is my wallet
"Wow, how cute. Poor Castorice,she just wanted to be happy"
Honkai star rail anime when?
This animation make me cry in just 6 minutes...
Yall think blade could finally rest if she touches him?
I was like oh New animation Upload !! Then a rope hugged my neck.
"5:58 começa a tocar pela luz dos  olhos teus de Tom jobim, NAO É POSSIVEL Q NENHUM BRASILEIRO ESTA FALANDO DISSO CARA"
Omaga
Sooo how did she meet her dragon?
"Bro, shaoji wanna turn castorice as a decepticon called soundwave 😢"
Who's cutting her hair?
Their trailer 🗿but in actual gameplay 🤡
"oh my dear Castorice you are not death, but rebirth 💔💕"
"nah, mydei doesn't die from castorice's hands and blade is FULLY immortal. mydei has a weak spot and he still survives, so i imagine that she'd do nothing to blade either"
@coraW  then that paradise may be unreachable for him after all🥲😂
This boring ass story
we got hsr anime before genshin
this is so sad and I love Castorice
I would like to hug her ❤❤❤
"3:00 
My mind play dirty
She just run not getting backshoted😅"
😭😭😭💔💔💔

"I cried, I weeped, I'm not lying! I SHED FIVE TEARS I COUNTED!!"
"Therefore, I shall pull."
Seeing her happy and pretending to dance with everyone is kinda soul crushing ngl.

"Maybe it’s a good thing HoYo doesn’t produce a full anime because my heart broke in under 8 minutes 😭😭😭

Can’t wait for Castorice!"
Furina has been superseded
"Ok algo que ame del pasado de Castorice es que muchos la ven como una bendición de los dioses por poner fin a la vida sin dolor, pero ella lo ve como una maldición por que siempre estuvo sola .
Me encantoooooo este corto una maravilla y Castorice me encanta <3 ."
"7:17 ""Nokotan desu"" comes to my mind..."
"Blade: please touch me, end my suffering"
im gonna have to charge hsr for attempted murder bc wtf?
Is castorice a vidyadhara? Or is she a demigod already? Cause how is it that she isn't aging?
My daughter 😭😭
This is art

Well for once she'll able to embrace TB
Hordeixa eu chorei no cinema senhores.

2:42😭😭😭
❤ sự tái sinh
Sedihnyo
"I loved this, Come home soon Castorice"
This animated short made me sad 😭
After watching this trailer made me realized why hoyo made that global passive for castorice.
😢
слезовыжимательно
Global Passive
Deserved for having global passive
"Oh, it can't be right now I'm just tears 😭😭😭😭😭"
she is amumu from hsr
"I like her short way more than Firefly one, a lot more strong emotions"
This video make cry a lot!!!
She’s such a sweetheart..😭💗
starrail is actually a game that is literally one piece
zeref from fairytail literally
why is everything so fking perfect in this game
so basically hoyoverse developers have one piece fans in them LOL
Good god… I knew she had a sad backstory but I didn’t think it would effect me so badly
That deer was locked tf in😭
C I N E M A
"Their heads are a little too big when they are younger, but otherwise great animation."
La cancion es demasiado similar a las tonadas de HI3rd que gran historias nos mostraran 🥺🥺
"It's more down to earth. Firefly was fighting a galatic war, which is less relatable to people."
Cute. I still dislike Castorice.
REVIVIÓ EL FUTBOL SEÑORES
My baby
This animated short was quite literally horrifying and so artistically beautiful
Poor castorice…😭😭😭
CASTORICE MY BELOVED 💔
All I do in this fandom is cry🥀
"Wow, this definitely has some Frieren and Violet Evergarden vibes."
Love it looks amazing 🥰
That deer looked into my soul...
cried. beautiful character
Seeing this video i'm sad about Castorice because she can't touch anything or it will die
I understand why god gave me depression now. It was all so I could hug Castorice.
"This is no short or snack, its a full course meal!"
"Hey, guys, now Castorice can hug Mydei, because death does not take him away."
she deserves much more
dang greek tragedified
Omg...that was perfect
Вы довели меня до слез..
"Damn, that's grim."
"She can't touch or hug anyone, till she met her husband Caelus"
Imagine being mad at her global passive when she's such an icon. I love her
🦆🦆🦆
HOW OLD IS SHE??
HOW DARE YOU MAKE ME CRY ON A RANDOM MONDAY
U too greedy hoyo too greedy
esse curta me quebrou......
2:42 me and my friends that only i can see
Vro sounds like subaru natsuki
A classic
Hoyoverse sleep with one eye open 🥀
this is just ymir from attack on titan MY GOAT
7:17 why are you staring at me like that
"Very cool animation, but unfortunately, that doesn't change hoyo's hands being cold."
"""This is a wholesome and positive story"" a great man once said"
Absolute Cinema 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
"""I can fix her"" -- Stella"
вау как же это красиво
MY SHAYLAAA😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
"It’s Shionne all over again, but much less painfull"
At least a few hundred years. Who knows when this backstory takes place. So a few hundred is a good estimate
Depends on how ya look at it. Shionne didn't typically kill folks from touch just servere pain
7:15 why is this deer trying yo mog us
sadge
I started shedding tears when she hugged granny
Watching this and crying during my microbiology class 😢
sus deer..
"Блин, я даже всплакнул!"
"Am I still playing a game? I need a break from genshin leme play star rail
Star Rail:"
Voy a llorar.
I Think Like Citlali Quest?
"¿Por qué son así? 😿
Cada personaje de Amphoreus es protagonista de su propia telenovela."
Как.... Как  7  с половиной минут заставили меня плакать?????? Вот она сила искусства
:face-purple-crying::face-purple-crying::face-purple-crying:
Still not enough to excuse predatory global passives
I dont like where it goes...
Nokotan mentioned…. Nun!
"English dubs still just so inferior to JP. They’re so much better at casting and voice acting. Eng always feels so forced and campy, no naturalness at all. First guy only one who did well."

1 week until i am reunited with my wife
How she takes bath with taht hand?
aftrer this her reaction in a game feels week
I felt every negative emotion a thousand fold. Thank you Hoyo for killing me again.
Beautifully done 😢 give us an Anime thankyou 🙏 so touching ❤
😥😥😥😥😥
Ето очень красиво
До слез... Т_Т
"Nice animation, awesome studios who animated it, scummy company.
Remove Global Passive."
wish i didn't watch this why am I crying??
insanely beautiful calmingly chaotic music 6:00 onwards
"If there is life there will be death and if there was death there is be life. Both are suffering and cycle back again and again...
I HATE IT"
очень красиво ❤
todo a por castorice
god
Honkai hurtrail impact
OKAY GUESS I HAVE TRY MY DAMN HARDEST TO GET THIS UNIT
"Not even this beautiful animation can make me forget how awful Castorice Global Passive/Buff is

Remove it hoyo!"
thank you for making me cry
Simplemente hermoso la animacion y la historia hsr nunca deja de sorpendemer con este tipo de cosas
"Another animated short from Hoyo. This will be great with my food!
7 mins later
Ugly sobbing while food slip out my mouth 😭"
She can obviously touch her own body
I will be summoning for her all Jades for Castorice
"No one needs to be lonely in this world, so cherish your friends and family because they are only one you have."
I HATE YOU HOYOVERSE
"Jesus Christ Mihoyo I was already going to pull, you didn't have to make me cry."
MY SHAYLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
CASTORICE WILL COME HOME 😭😭
"« Elle a voulut être la vie, elle a été béni par la mort »

Trop déchirant pour mon petit coeur… 😭😭"
О боже...Я забыла как дышать...😭❤‍🩹
these are getting WAY TO GOOD
Emilia tan is that you?? 😮😮💜💜
"Lo único que no entiendo es, como la anciana no murió instantáneamente y los demás si?  
Aparte la abrazo, por lo que se desintegraría aun mas rápido, supongo

De todos modos, muy bueno el lore"
Oh deer this is tragic 😢
did they remove her passive yet?
This is beautiful and heartbreaking
That was just beautiful; thank you
"0:24 ""I hate these Icy hands""

For Disney fans, you should be deja vu with this statement."
"It's hurt , really hurt, right into my heart"
This is going on my reasons for why i have mental breakdown
Stelle/Caleus: I will hug you forever ♾️❤💍
I just got into hsr. I'm not crying you're crying :eyes-purple-crying:
How were there days and nights when Castorice was young? I thought Aquila’s eyes were closed a long time before this?
This is so sad yet so true
😢sad
Oh this is such a beautiful anima -- QAQ
Close enough welcome home Emilia 💜💜❄️❄️
And then they've announced only one Anaxa's video.
Лучшее что я видела
2:43 trying to hold hands and dance with your shadow and relfection is some next level loneliness damn
Wow😮
HOYO I'M CRYING 😭
"Guys, who tf is cutting onions rn!"
So sad...
Nice story > Still has passive > Still skipping
"Yep. We know who's Hoyo's fave unit this version.


Penacony was Acheron"
This hurt so much 😭😭😭
"This hurt, man. 🥲"
this one hits a little different
Castorice is incredibleeee ❤❤
Oh.
"Sadly... Im no longer a hsr player,but if i was one until now... Castorice would definitely be my new main on my account because damn... Not only her gameplay is cool but her story got tears to my eyes and im not a person to cry over fictional stuff"
This is so Fate go coded 😂
Я не могу перестать плакать при просмотре...
Chinese poem: 举杯邀明月，对影成三人。by Li Bai
 @warai_otoko  what does it mean?
" @irhamz5179  Raise my goblet to invite moon, with my shadow, we become three."
 @elainechen5115  i know theres a deep meaning but im too dumb to understand 😅
"i knew she was dancing alone, but didn't realize that she was dancing with her shadow and reflecting until i saw your comment lol"
Maybe it is... Maybe _ ...
I did cry alot but idk why I still am not interested in her character
tem que vender pra depois descartar a personagem.
thanks I cried
Omg T-T
"""But big sister Castorice, your hands are so warm!"" Made me cry a whole river"
ну я плачу зачем столько стекла ((((((((((((((((
I bet Castorice would love to hug Blade 💀
MY SHAYLA 😭😭😭😭
"Ну всё, всё... и так грустный персонаж, а тут столько драмы нагнали... аж до слёз!
Продали, продали вы Касторию!)"
5:50 POOR CASTORICE😭😭😭 I WANNA GIVE HER A BIG OLD HUG SM FR IDC IF I DIE
its sad that hoyo cant put these kinda animations IN GAME...
:) ..... :(
So that deer has no meaning or?
omg i am crying i feel so bad for her and dang this animation was amazing
Okay HoYo we get it no one can be happy
Cool now remove global passive
ueli
"actually crying.. absolute cinema, hoyo"
😭😭😭 ดู 10 รอบ ร้องสิบรอบ 😭😭😭
7 minutes ago I was so excited and happy
That hug broke me bro holy
I couldn't hold back my tears either😭
I cried a whole sea
OK
me too..
😂😂😂Omg ​ @AriGato8155 
 @AriGato8155  reading this and seeing a furina pfp is making me laugh
Damn onion cutting ninjas 😢
sobbing
They loved her so much they made this entire animation in game. I love Castorice and I wish I could hug her without dying.
I cried too😢😢😢😢❤
They will start doing it from next update
next patch
It symbolises rebirth
"Castorice es inmortal?, perdon pero aun no llego a amphoreus"
😢😢😢
"Hoyo giveth, Hoyo taketh away... Giving my heart something to cherisch, to rip it apart with a sad backstory."
It's sad that some others would consider her ability a blessing while she considers it a curse 1:40 ex. Relieving people from slow death
Gives me Rogue ( from X-Men) vibes. She can't physically touch anyone either. If she touches a mutant she takes their powers and their memories. If she touches a regular human they get knocked out and she takes their memories. But if she holds on for too long she kills them.
Hoyoverse WHAT DID I JUST SAW? 😭
"Damn, it’s been a hot minute since an animation brought me to tears, please, i hope I win my 5050"
I‘m not crying… really 😭😭😭
"Old friend sees Castorice
Talks to her for a while
Holds her hand to comforts her pain
Dies from Death Touch
Refruses to Elaborate further"
😭😭😭😭😭
beautiful well done!
NOOOOOOO CASTORICEEEE CAAASSSIEEEEEE NNOOOOO I AM CRYING NOOOOOOOOO 😭😭😭😭😭😭
THIS IS INSANE TYSM I LOVE HER SO MUCH MORE NOW
Hi. Making and posting animations is optional fyi.
"Con un demonio, ahora tendre que tirar por ella... hermoso el video"
"Another ""wholesome and heartwarming"" moment. Thanks shaoji for this wonderful story that doesn't cause depression at all"
"And yet, she's so quiet and doesn't freak out AT ALL when we touch her in 3.1 story?"
Relatable
❤ a Herta.
Cool now how about using some animations like this in game? thoughts?
😂
to be fair it has a hopeful ending
Amphoreus story made me realize that shaoji's writing is really subpar pacing. I don't think he properly learned how to write
​ @OgZz73 an ac fan saying that is ironic...
​ @parsashirali8957  yeah even ac story is better overall in comparison. Thats how bad amphoreus is.
Because they were fighting Flame reaver
" @plasticbeetle5377  Even after that, she just brings it up in such a casual way. Shouldn't she be freaking out that there's someone she can actually interact with without causing them to die?"
Expect 1 extra gigabytes and  cooked low spec phone
Cinema (I cried) 🚬🗿
"Why do english voice actors always ruin it so much, they sound so uncanny"
"""I hired this deer to stare at you"""
"yes, I'm crying a lot"
"Estuvo un poco fuerte 
Procede a llorar"
I don't like castorice that much but damn.
😢😢😢
"Don't worry guys Castorice will kill HSR with her touch, but it will be reborn again! maybe, or not..."
Absolute Kino
💔💔💔
Why does Hoyo have an active interest in making me cry?
Brutal
"And now she will be happy when realize she can touch in TB. Good history, good marketing. 11/10"
Hope you all get your big hug from Aunt Cassie!
2:59 - 3:03 -  that's some lewd loop right there
They outdid themselves. Wow.
grim reaper elsa
7:17 What'd I do....
How dare you make me cry today 😢😢
"Blade: Dies ""Is there a chance..?""

Castorice: Revives him 

Blade: ""..I live..?  Sigh..."""
It will be reborn because people will realize that they overreacted too much
 @Zek106 so true.
Meu Deus como eu sou triste agora
bro….. 😭
"""oh my! A castorice short animation!  What a delight!"" 

I was then shot 57."
4:26. Castorice is even 4x or 5x older than me? :)))
Castorice’s hands are too powerful for anyone to hold
and we all cried
"""Gimme a hug Castorice""
""But it will kill you!""
""Did I f***ing stutter?"""
She's so lonely ((
How can you not like this character? She is my undisputed #1
It's so pretty!😍 😍
như vậy là sắp có chương mới à
beautiful (I am going to cry)
❤💔
"Eu não gosto da Castorice, mas caramba, que curta. Ficou muito bonito."
Она всего лишь хотела обнимашек ...
I'M NOT CRYING YOU ARE
Я РИДАЮ
Just beautiful
They did a really good job. Honestly even I felt emotional
I cant stop watching it… Its so sad😢

WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY😭😭😭😭😭😭

Eu tava triste até aparecer o veado no final 😅
I came happy I leave crying. I'll protect you Castorice !
Sigo diciendo q si el juego por lo menos en esta parte de ampho ubieran echo la tematica aun mas romana y q de verdad se note las guerras en vez de hacer cinematicas negras y habladeria de paja bien aburrida. y q el gameplay transmita lo mismo q una cinematica fuese aun mejor juego.
"context, please, why is everyone says this is sad?"
Tbh this was so unnecessary like we re not even getting an animation for every chreisos heirs.
now I'm crying! T_T My Tender Death... Only Death is always alone...

HoYoverse makes me suffer and cry again with such animated stories...
Not sure which hit me harder this or Firefly's trailer.

Best anime visual i've ever watched❤
"Midas touch, but death. ☹️"
"Global Passive is justified she's sad.




























😊
No hate just facts"
"I will cry a thousand times if Death even hurts me...
Castorice told me that even though we fear Death we still embrace it to see some people we know who died a thousand times for us to live and 
I know this is a crappy comment but I'm trying to express myself after watching this vid"
Put this stuff in game 😭
я расплакалась 😢
"As much as I like her character, her BS global passive won't make me pull for her. GL for those who will!"

She really just wants warm hug TnT
Mumei is graduating
"No, it's actually literally just poetic. :D"
why she had to kill bro like that though?
 @oreo-hm4lh  he was probably a criminal
 @itsnotpj  I think... it is best we let go 😔
"Очередная очень сильная девушка, но такая одинокая и несчастная. Кого-то она меня напоминает…
Господи, дойные коровы у них все одного сорта чтоли"
"100% gonna grind for her, its gonna be so hard pulling for both 5 star tingyun and her as an f2p"
Adult head into small child body
😞
Castorice 🥲
"She danced with death all her life, yet she danced alone."
So do chrysos heirs have eternal youth?
"God, Did they agree this year to release anime and short films that will tear your soul apart and make you cry?"
"Idk whats more sad, this animation or her global passive."
"100/10 absolute cinema 👏

Another new short animation lets go

I will sob uncontrollably if we get to use this line
"Stelle: You will never be alone again, Castorise, because I will always be there for you."
"​ @kinigthran5715  grown 𝓪𝓼𝓼 man btw

ts so corny 😭"
​ @henrykk852 what's THAT supposed to mean?
There are two people on Amphoreus who can touch her hands without risking their lifes. Mydei and Trailblazer.
 @Meodus how about Blade?
" @nightingbird  He doesn't know a sh*t about Amphoreus, but yes, if only he knew..."
"I’m going to care for her so much with my Caelus. She deserve happiness, loves and gentle warm hug like others. F it, reaper wife. 

Castorice can be a good mother, if her childs are immune ofcourse"
"“OMG Castorice lore!”
“No” said Evil Hoyoverse"
It's too early for me to cry like this. 😢
4:20 - 😭
"Well that was an incredible animated short. Animation, story, emotion..."
Sniff- Is someone chopping onions?  😭
CENIMA ✋😭🤚
This is officially a Honkai game with this short.
Why hsr have better animation then genshin
"Emilia-tan, you've really gotten yourself into trouble!"

I'm never watching a short animation during breakfast again.
o7

Hoyo playing gatcha your hearts T^T
I don't care if it kills me.... Castorice is getting a hug

                            -A simp"
Poor Castorice 😥😥😥💔
"welp, thats one way to start my morning 😭"

"Remember when we were just goofing around in Belobog searching in trashcans?,
 me too

Me too."
7:17 hear me out

"Trailblazer is going to give her a hug guys, I promise."
Where is Mydei animated short.
My eyes are just sweaty it’s okay
I cried while watching this in class
"fix your game.

(nice story telling and cinematics though!)"
5:49 😭
Why???? Why make a Character That it is impossible for her to touch someone?
"Alcuni significati meno comuni del cervo nell'antica Grecia includono:

- Rinascita e rigenerazione: I cervi erano noti per la loro capacità di rigenerare le corna, quindi erano spesso associati alla rinascita e alla rigenerazione."
"It's okay, Castorice, you can always hug Mydei!.."
"Crazy how we hate her for being overpowered, and she hates herself for it, too."
7:17 - Queens never cry.
Subaru 💜💜
"mids, dont get shorts"

BUDDY STOPP
Who is we? You know not everyone is a whiny ass crybaby over her global passive right?
" @Blub6  I was building pity. It's not that serious, dude."
We don't hate her.  We hate what Hoyo did to her in their cold corporate greed.
Who's we
It's not that she's overpowered it's just that her global passive sets a precedent for future units that doesn't sit well with us
dude you are so right. It is such a great analogy
"​ @Blub6 
It's a joke....."
nice joke
"Who is ""we"" bro 😂😂😂😭😭😭"
wife. im crying she deserves so much better </3
Yay! Castorice animation... Yay! Castorice animation (with tears streaming down my eyes)
"wait what, i didnt even notice this short was 7 minutes, oh my lord i was crushed"
Genshin impact anime 😂😂😂😂
3:01 💀
"Their goal was to make us empathize and see ourselves in her. After all, who among us hasn't been alone at least once, or is still alone?"
Blade after this video:🫂
Blade: Where my hug at 😅
"Meu deus, que perfeita!!!!"
wow
"Damn, seeing Castorice from 5:45 to 5:57 brought back memories for me. I will get Castorice, by any means necessary and at all costs."
Яоши дуреет от одного взгляда на эту картину.
6:00 ost name please?
absolute cinema
"почему такие короткометражки не сделали для других персонажей, того же Мидея?"
"Please let me hug her
...
💔"
Mori Calliope?
você me fez acreditar que esse curta foi um anime triste muito bom de 12 episódios que marcou minha alma
0:04 Ahhh welcome back Subaru
Shigaraki Tomura in a parallel universe and it hurts every time
I am Castorice 80%..
"Подобные анимации стоят огромных денег, по этому их делают только для персонажей которые гарантированно на их баннерах соберут огромные донаты. Взять того же Мидея, просто не выгодно делать про него анимацию. Если вспомнить, анимации делали ещё  для генерала и для Фэйсяо, которые себя окупили незначительно. Ещё чисто по моему мнению, зависит от лора героя. Вспомнить Арлекинно из геншина. Там весьма грустная история. Светлячок получала подобную анимацию и вот дошло до Кастории. Всех связывает только пару вещёй. 1- поверкрипный герой 2- интересный и может грустный лор. 3- 100% вероятность что герой соберёт огромную сумму на своём баннере."
She was Amphoreus icon in opening.
It's raining outside today...
Absolute Cinema
❤
could have been sadder ngl.
Well she could have used her GLOBAL PASSIVE to revive them ALL now couldn't she ; Hoyo?

"0:24

Everything I touch turns into Skittles.

"And yet, she can hold my hand with no issues. How will I be able to help her?"
I think Elsa will appear on Snezhnaya

I'm getting Honkai 3rd flashbacks and I don't think I'll be able to take it any longer.
I cant believe my eyes..im sobbing so hard
am i just a viewer to you?
"О нет, это должно быть глазной сок!"
This is what I was worried about that hoyo would make me desperately NEED to pull her with an animated short
I'm not watching all that
Perhaps I sobbed uncontrollably
zeref. :)
"I admit, I was crying inside. It touched both my heart and soul. Castorice is like Zeref from Fairy Tail."
WOW!  TT__TT
havent had a trailer this sad since firefly😭😭
"I already knew I was gonna pull for her, but after this I'm convinced even more."
"""Like fireflies to a flame... life begets death"""
"""What will you have after 500 years?"""
"Wow way to suddenly make me cry. I was gonna skip her banner because I’m scared waiting for Elysia but now I have got to save her and bring her in my journey, we can’t leave her alone guys 😭"
They had to make this so sad for castorice didn't they. 😢
Hits so much more knowing how she must feel now that she has found someone who she can hold.
How dare you stab me multiple times!
"I can’t tell if hoyo plays favorites with these trailers or if they just pick a random character and go “you. Your get an animated trailer” 

Either way I’m ok with this"
to em prantos
She should meet Blade.
Younhave 5 patches to save for Elysia dont worr you will get her.
OH MY GOD 😭😭😭
Her power so strong she’s gonna kill lol
"A character who hates death, but is blessed with granting fatality 🥲"
One Hug...
"Im not crying 
It's you guys"
Скучна
Anyone hating on her now doesn't deserve her. i hope you lose all your 5050s from now on. My poor baby 😭😭
My heart just crumbled-
7:17 this just became a horror short
THIS TRAILER FELT LIKE A WHOLE ANIME 😭😭😭
I really need to stop cutting onion while watching these.

5:28 Big Sister Castorice
"no estoy llorando, tú lo estás haciendo!"
um…. 23secs in and im- … wow
I hate castorice has global passive but now I feel it might be lore accurate. She is as far from revive than any character so story might cause her revive mechanism be lore accurate. Let's hope 3.2 story is good enough to me to accept global passive.
Castorice i love you 🥺
‏‪7:23‬‏ I THAUGHT HE WILL EAT ME
"So can cass actually kill blade??? Really cool if could finaly give him what he wonts ( im going to assume she cant right, lorewise i mean."

Question:""What should i say if i'm Castorice?""

Castorice is like Lucia Konohana from Rewrite from Visual Arts Key. Everything that she touches will wither and cursed.
A whole whole movie I'm not crying you are
Poor castorice

"7 minutos de curta animado em 2D, impossível."

"Life is meaningless, it is in death we are truly tested."

"""people die when they are killed"" - Castorice"
7 mins no way.
Продано!!!

Poor guy was killed by anime
HOYO I AM GOING TO SUE FOR EMOTIONAL DAMAGES
holy shi
POOR BABY…
radium rice
This was sad :(( i hope we get anaxa next
This is so heartbreaking to see her lonely like this 😞💔🌧️
That deer kinda bad tho…
Her embrace might have been as cold as death but to me it felt as warm as life
"If she hadn't tried to kill my Trailblazer, I might have actually liked her.
Shame really. 😕
Easy skip."
PAY FOR MY THERAPY HOYO
This is fire
Castorogue...
What a beautiful and emotional video. Castorice just broke my heart and made me cry 😢❤
"Come to Papa, my girl Casto! I know you need a hug 🥸"
"😭😭😭
Guys, please, don't pull her. Don't make her kill anybody more...
😭😭😭"
ทำดีอีกแล้ววววว
Her story a little bit remind me Citlali's story 😢😢😢
"Honestly, I didn't want to spin Kastoria. As a girl, I'm more interested in guys. But after this video my opinion changed. Damn Hoyovers, this Chinese industry knows how to sell us characters."
"I'm sorry but, feeling Pity still won't make me pull for her."
Wiseman : sometimes power don't be a gift but curse immortality is not heaven but more worse than death
"7 min trailer? okay then

L GLOBAL PASSIVE"
WASNT PLANNING ON CRYING TODAY
Castorice would be deemed a god if she ever gets to Liyu- I meant Xianzhou Alliance.
why u gotta do this to me hsr
This Animation just wooow  ❤
"She could probably be able to touch people, and im just spitballing ideas here, if they created a senario where her global passive didnt exist. Pretty sure everyone would like that."
I feel bad for castorice all she wants is to feel… and she can’t
"poor castorice :((, she really just need a warm hug."
"0:30 min , i hear a faint tatakae i fear"
Soo does anyone know if Castorice death touch works on robots Svarog alongside TB could probably hold her hands
Ooh Nice Power Castorice
My god...
Castorice will come home along with her lc! Good luck to everyone pulling!❤
Bruh
"Just please put a ""hug Castorice"" option in game for when we talk to her, just, let her have a staple place and always have a ""hug"" option"
"Dayym, who's cutting onions"
Broke my ACTUAL heart... damn that's good writing! 😢
“Amphoreus will be heartwarming” - Shaoji
5:19 No…..HER RAW EXPRESSION NOOO MY SHAYLAAA😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Wonder where Licorice is
"Until this point, i still don’t like her in game design, hoyo always give woman a dress and her dress in game look weird, her anime is good thou"
Firefly animated short video made me cry and now this one totally made me cry again😢
E S C E N C I A 🗣️🔥🗿
Who tf is cutting onions?!!!😢
Я что плакать сюда прихожу!?
Truly an emotional short video. Really well introduced character and backstory. Hope there will be one like this for potentially every character moving forward. Cant wait to find out more about Anaxa.
Blade may finally have hope this time...
"This isn't gonna work Hoyo, I can't watch your anime with this water in my eyes."
I can't wait for Phainon! I can already imagine how peak he's gonna be
poor castorice now i want her even more💜
that last part made me tear up..
I LOVE GLOBAL PASSIVE HAIL MR POKEE
I wonder if she can touch mydei cause mydei is almost immortal
Паверкрипнула бабку получается
Heart breaking
That was beautifuuuuuul
Why Hoyo makes her past is so sad
Im not crying yall crying😭😭😭😭
tội nghiệp gạo vậy
A like Castorice backstory just not her passive
"7:06 Asumadre, un Venao!"
adorably!
Feels like AoT x HSR crossover
Anime name?
"Girl...why you so head,...."
"Que historia más triste, realmente Castorice merece un gran abrazo"
"2:42 I'm not crying
 it's just raining"
"what was that? 
Castorice: death.
 what kind?
Castorice:instant.
 there was no sound he just died?
Castorice:yeah terrifying, its terrifying thing watch happen."
Poor Castorice!
"Фигня полная, у Светы было интересней и драматичнее, а тут просто жизненный цикл жизни и смерти, драма на пустом месте, хотя у Светы тоже, чет Хойе не могут в драму"
YOU DEER
"I dont care you are complaining about her global passive, iam gonna get her"
"Я что плачу за интернет, чтобы плакать?!? 


Да. Видимо за это ( ཀ ʖ̯ ཀ)"
This will make even more tragic when we...Trailblazers....will say goodbye to Castorice....
My Shayla…..😢😢😢 only 7 minutes but make me cry… her back story is so sad… I just want to hug her… ( did I die..?? )
"If this is peak, Imagine what they gonna do with Pahinon"
Nice
🔥😍
Oh hsr... I won't stop loving you ... a masterpiece you are..❤
"Caelus, I can fix her."
we all are crying with this one 😭
5:45 reaction to ppl who skip her 😢
"Мультики вы по-прежнему делаете хорошие. Осталось c игрой как-то разобраться, а то чем дальше, тем бестолковее она выглядит."
Re:Zero Reference. But that my favorite 😍
Welcome Powercreep
2:42 this break my heart
Being isolated coz you have a curse and cant touch a single life is worst than that having a normal immortality or long life like elves. Castorice have both T_T
"Всем игрокам которые занимаются review bombing Я хочу сказать: 
"" Прекратите дурью заниматься, идиоты. Castorise просто соответствует своему лору не пытается быть атмосферным персонажем с точки зрения мира. Точно так же как и все остальные персонажи из этого дополнения. В играх Hoyoverse помимо дурацкой аркады которую вы постоянно пытаетесь ставить Во главу угла есть ещё Атмосфера и проработка мира. И именно для того чтобы Атмосфера и проработка мира были лучше - этот персонаж был вот так сделан. 
А если вы хотите высказать какое-то негодование, то я предлагаю вам заняться адекватным делом - пойти и посмотреть историю про то что Yostar , Yongshi пытались получить контроль над жизнью одного из сотрудников и  занимались сексуальным характером. Вот здесь можете попробовать своё негодование выразить потому что оно куда более адекватное будет. Либо же вообще прекратите себя так вести, и портить жизнь реальным людям которые работают над этими играми, не создавать им реальные проблемы в их реальных жизнях. Прекратите вести себя как потребители и свиньи, и начните вести себя как люди адекватные."""
HOYO REMEMBERED THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ANIME STUDIO
If only Hoyo put as much effort into their game as they did these amazing character videos.
"What have you done to us,hoyo"
I cried
I was crying my eye balls out m'n this was sooo sad😢😢😢
"""A thing isn't beautiful because it lasts"""
"Can't say anything after seeing all this, how hurt and sad castorice feels"
"Мде вот бы Мидею 7 минут ролика 
Но у вас же видимо кто-то умрет, если для мужского перса постараетесь"
"Yeah cool video, anyway I'm pulling for Anaxagoras"
Absolute cinema
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
😢
7:17 damn that deer is locked in
😢😢😢
"ну вы и так мне её продали, ещё раньше. зачем стеклом то в бонус посыпать("
Global passive was made so that Castorice won't be sad anymore 😭
Let's all hug this lonely little sun!?
No dragon cameo ?
I love her even more now omg 😭
Wtf jesus this is tragic. I mean I've seen this done before (Zeref from fairy tail) but this next level
Блэйд бы её обнял
We're gonna take down Hades with this one.

And anaxshit gets nothing 😂
My poor girl Castorice. Come homeeeee
"Somehow we felt it, how lonely and painful to live as Little Castorice"
2:59 is where Castorice gets Backshots from Trailblazer in 3.2(it's a Foreshadowing)
not like hi3 please we traumatized
But Stelle can hug her
"RememBlazer = Star Platinum +Crazy Diamond+Za Warudo
Aglaea = Silver Chariot
Tribbie = D4C lol
Castorice = Killer Queen... wait.. PURPLE HAZE seem more fitting"
Her power is a curse ☠️
5:43 TS PMO OHMYGOD 😭😭
Fairy Tail mentioned
"It's nothing new, but always effective"
No don't remind me... Zeref's suffering... I can't see it... 😢 He can't even approach people with love or affection in his heart... way too cruel...
"Правда будет иронично, если даже объятья Кастории не смогли бы подарить ему этот покой..."
sybau
"Даже как-то мерзко, буквально давят на пожалейку чтобы персонажа продать, бедная китайская инди студия, сотрудники наверное последнюю миску риса доедают, лучше бы скиллсет нормальный сделали, без коляски, bruh"
Eu não tô chorando você que tá chorando
Omgg castorice my shayla :(( I'm gonna cry she js need a big warm hug

How sad that such a rich story would be wasted on Honkai Star Rail's black screens and repetitive animations.
😮
Castorice literal hicieron un personaje muy hermoso ya que así de Seguro sentiría la muerte
"..НУ ВСЁ, ВЫБИВАЮ СЕБЕ КАСТОРИЮ..хоть там смогу держать её руку"

Castorice be like -My instant death ability is overpowered 😂
"А можно такие же вайбы у Кастории в игре сделать?? А не вайфушку, которая смотрит как гг спит... (тогда бы я ее крутила)"
My dear castorice 💗💗💗
"Blade: ""TOUCH ME! HARDER!!"""
Versi jepangnya mana lee
This was honkai star rail???
"Stick didn't decay, 0/10."
"Wife deserves a hug, even if that would kill you"
Blade: I need her contact. NOW
​ @elvinli8662  he can't find her because Amphoreus is a hidden world.. He need to find Black Swan first.
Trailblazer can
"Can he? Maybe
Would he? Probably not"
His body is IMMORTAL but bro his charectar is shadow honkai edition
"He can . He has Nikador's power and share its authority , Mydei can touch her ."
 @je_ne_perds_pas  ayo? pause

"What is this salty discharge on my eyes 💧😭, I will pull her first no matter what, straightforward when her banner has been updated ❤"

Oh Castorice you tragic soul...
Lol wtf they have hoyoanime studio but why still no genshin anime 😂😂😂😂😂
"Yeah... with her power being what it is I suspected as much.




Now, this is just my own musings, but having just lost someone close to my family, I can understand how death can be a release from suffering..."
Ну заплачь.mp3
I did not expect to feel this heart wrenched at 2 am but here we are.
