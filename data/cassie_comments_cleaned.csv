they clearly felt the cold water during beta anaxa had a global passive that gave like lvls to basic attacks to everyone but after people complained they removed that one and left cas
after playing the story i still think the global passive didnt have to exist while castorice does go through her arc to understand the value of life death and save the tb thats it she even says its a one time exception for our tb so having a revive as an ingame global passive is still a weird choice it could been really funny if it only worked for tb
it is broken as the reason most showcases achieve cycle in moc will likely be due to the global passive saving their sustain less team
being selfaware that you sound like a hoyo shill doesnt stop you from sounding like a hoyo shill
i dont really mind the passives even if they are global if i cant pull the character im not going to bankrupt myself just to get the character anything that can help my skill issue or survivability is a welcomed addition but i can see why other players see this as a bad thing some people have poor financial thinking and try to get them anyway
im not having castorice and paying more attention to situations where her passive whould have saved my run happens frequently i play sustainless a lot there are teams which lack for example exact one additional turn or there are a lot of healing machanics in apoc now so her passive really influences overall account results im pretty sure people with castorice on acc have overall better results couse it is really much more doable to play sustainless with her im already feeling the diff between me and castorice havers and what if it worsens with the other global passives
hoyocuck cc
the furthest it should go is affecting the opposite half in endgame party modes only if castorice is deployed in one
i dont think they will do it again most than anything because they didnt label it as global if they wanted to make it a thing they wouldve labeled it properly
hoyo is a business and the game is easy enough to clear without global passives its weird to complain about this in a single player game just pull on the characters you like and youll still be fine
ok this comment section is really starting to bug me no matter what you say a single revive a battle will never be op if you need it you are likely to weak to do the end game any way even with the passive
i was wondering what a globle passive was so if its just a char can do things while not on the team then i dont think thats bad meta wise its broken but this game has no pvp so its not really breaking anything but this game has terrible balancing of new enemies and constantly add new mechanics that older players or none meta players arent going to have fun the whiplash i got when i got silverwolf who was deem broken just to come back now to find out ill need every new buffer or some sort of follow up something to do enough damage just to beat some multiplying bug or scorpion thing and watch my units fail to even do half the dps these new ones do will always mind boggle me
global passive is good as long as they dont balance enemies with them in mind this should just be a nice little bonus to players who have characters with a passive and not as an excuse to make bump up the powercreep even further
here is my take i cannot finish my current moc with adventurine or fu xuan on the team i got blown up and my tank are both es you can say that i do not a good build but i counter it that the timing of this global passive and definitely suspicious nothing nothing aside from profit stopping from hoyoverse giving us castorice for free i too am looking forward other characters especially star character with global passive now how long do we need to wait are they as strong as star global passive
passive is good people need to leave the game if they dont agree
everyone knew that castorice would be ridiculously powerful the global passive seems like hoyoverses self fulfilling prophecy wouldnt be surprised if they pull a castorices banner was successful so this means players are ok with global passives out of their ass a global passive is inherently scummy im surprised youre defending it
i didnt really follow anythign about castorice so im surprised this was a thing but also man i just want dragon but probably not gonna get bc i just mydei e
revives are bad because they take up power budget on something that shouldnt even come up when trying to ride the line of lategame damage pushing having a free you dont need to budget for this revive you just get it is dramatic and i think this is going to be looked at as the moment hsrs powercreep became exponential
the way the devs are treating castorice is kinda making me dislike her and it really isnt the characters fault
i agree with you and i expect that this is a one thing with castorice or that if other characters have a global passive is a small one like more money at the end of the battle or the enemy doesnt detect you in the overworld and doesnt break the game but if i see that a new character comes out and have a really game changing passive more atk crit spd etc i will be the first one to truly be mad about it and yes i know that according to the leaks phainon supossesdly will have a global passive but lets not forget that leaks are not always right straight up lies or just ideas that came up during the creation phase of a character that ends up being eliminated lets not forget that we had leaks of screwllum being playabel since x and it not in the game yet but i do think that we should raise or voice and say loud and clearly that we just want this to be a one time thing or that the passive will be small and doesnt really affect combat in a significant way besides i think that the backlash that the game is recieving will tell hoyo that we dont want this global passives or that if ends up being included then all the characters need to have global passives example all destruction characters have break effect all hunt crit rate etc and you can only active a small amount at the same timelike or at the same time for the moment i will be kepping a close eye in what hoyo wants to do and acting accordingly
even with castorices revive youd still be death in moc both sides attack very frequently and she rezz you back with hp or hp
you are under the assumption i never cleared it and i did eventually i do need to figure out how to clear the second half and its annoying now i need to try more times than usual i also cleared it on beta too with castorice and possibly mydei separately i either use mydei tribe or anaxa castorice but not all hoyoverse is not dumb they dont release characters with useless global passive especially star we used to talk about how star is optional and i bet you can still make this argument too because somewhere someone can still clear it using only star not me and i dont have this much time
i think the problem with this passive is for me personally is that its just another giant thing on the pileup of things that make me feel like hoyoverse doesnt respect me as a player its not even just hsr my view towards hoyo has soured so significantly through their choices with genshin and now it feels like its been happening a lot in hsr its just im tired man i dont even want to play zz because even though currently theres nothing really wrong with it i just dont trust hoyo anymore and castorices passive is just like man they got so much feedback about how its great when shes on the team but dont make it global and they just once again ignored everything i feel very slighted and i no longer wish to play their games which sucks because i do still think theyre the best when it comes to character visual design and music im not qutting hsr yet but im truly on the fringe now its the last hoyo game i still actually play and honestly i dont know how much longer i will enjoy it for
not the end of the world yet they designed the ui and mechanics they will probably release more theyre testing the waters and given hoyos track record it will continue regardless of feedback if it ends up being good for profit even if the worst for this doesnt happen theres still so many other issues that have yet to be resolved and they do not communicate that they intend to solve any of them i love this game but its so hard to play and enjoy
global passive is not stupid you will understand after playing the story
im afraid they will remove the third condition to perfect clear moc with clear it with less than cycles remaining because technically by introducing this if you have castorice and a healer its almost impossible to die
people are so caught up with bs that everyone is losing focus on the things that really matter doesnt matter if hsr or any game in existence is moba pve pvp single player or whatfuckingever matter of fact is that every game has rules and mechanisms that differentiate it from other games and maintains the structure and enjoyment of a game hsr has broken its own rules over and over and over and it doesnt matter how you take it hoyo has fundementally broken hsrs mechanic without justification or reason again it doesnt matter if youre okay with or not or youre a hoyohater or a shil objectively in an equation hsrs formula has received changes and now it is unbalanced it is fundamentally flawed now and yes thats a bad thing if youre okay with it good for you but if theres a problem it should be addressed despite who feels like what about it tldr if youre not happy with hsr its fine if youre not happy thats also fine because the real matter at hand is that hoyo has altered the rules of game unjustly and thats the real issue weakness break weakness implant global passive not how we feel or think it isnt really the fact that global passives alone are an issue even though they should be the real issue is that hoyo has been dragging hsr down for months now weve lost so much faith and have been fed so much shit that we cant help but feel like the game will just get worse even though that has yet to happen i dont like to be pessimistic just for the sake of it but i cant look back at hoyos track record and back them up and it shows in the community yes people are going bonkers over the global passive even though they shouldnt at least not yet but the fact of the matter is that most people are frustrated and just hope for the worst every time a change is implemented im not talking about doomers or baiters but just genuine normal players tldr peoples outrage is justified since hoyo has been giving us nothing bad changes for almost a year now and people are just acting out naturally theres really nothing to complain here because thats just how people would react if all they are getting are bad news theyll exaggerate the issue and brace for impact all this doesnt matter because hoyo will get away with it unless people collectively move over to next big thing after gacha or something just take hoyo by storm or something drastic and unforeseen happens there will always be people wholl take whatever hoyo gives doesnt matter who these people are and why they do it but the majority will always take it i myself am playing the game so im no one different so unless the world becomes a perfect system were going to get whatever hoyo will serve tldr hoyo will do whatever they want and well take it unless something overtakes hoyo well be just subjected to this
i was never so quick to look away when the animations appeared
correction your unit will not die again while your units are under the effect of her passive they are immune to death until healed shielded or the autodeath two turns later so many people overlook this fact and is why her passive is actually pretty op and is a problem to be global among the other problems of it being global also need i remind people of the clip where hoolay cycled a full team you cant do anything in that situation having castorice there means you dont get cycled and get another chance to actually win espeically when the revived characters are immune to death for two turns shes going to become essential so that things like that just dont happen
because theyre greedy its that fucking simple
i honestly dont have an issue with it my team is focused around tanking surviving and such i use gepard natasha firefly and preservation tb but im also building up bailiu currently this global passive fits right into what im aiming for for my team shields and just being really hard to kill lmao
its not the end of the world but i probably is the beginning of the end
finally someone who isnt acting like it isnt the end of the world and knows the sense behind it
yours is genuinely the only normal response to this ive seen like i get it i get that hyv probably doesnt have a good track record in peoples eyes but the hypotheticals are getting annoying they previously stated they liked making the anniversary characters super strong or something like that it may never exist in another character or if they do i doubt they will mess with stats because people speed tune etc their characters in this game and that would affect too much i also agree that mydeis forced auto is way more of a problem since it fully affects the way the player actually plays ahem or cant play the game i saw many claim that mydei being uncontrollable makes sense because of spoiler for gaining the power he did i think this is a poor argument because throughout the end of the quest he remains entirely reasonable and in control he only implies a future loss of control and only ever alludes to this intense fury when in phainons version of the trial and nikador is egging him on even in his own for the trailer he got he didnt actually look out of control ever also jingliu and bladie should also be uncontrollable retroactively then castorices ability implies that during this patch she very well might get the coreflame of death which would mean she lowkey controls who lives or dies if we really go deep into the lore you can think of it like castorice is a kind person and wouldnt want us or our friends to die but because balance is required for life and death she can only revive to hp and if theyre meant to stay alive preservation or abundance will protectheal them otherwise they still die and the balance of death continues i say this because even if shes kind i think she very well understands that people and things do need to die eventually it seems that starting with mydei they really wanted to go for lore abilities for their kits to a new level i mean everyone complained about mydeis auto feature before he was released and even after every post related to him was full of comments to remove it before release especially because they only avoided mentioning it in the english stream honestly i think this decision is worse for him because at e you can only control his ult which is a bummer for people like me who never play on auto its such an odd choice when we already had characters this would apply to and they dont have anything like this its interesting from a design choice but poor from player experience perspective its a glorified followup attack godslayer be god specifically that isnt treated as one anyway for castorice too i think its interesting from a design perspective but even though i personally do not mind it because this is a single player pve game the largely negative reaction shows that from the player perspective its a poor choice my real question is why dont the others aglaea tribbie anaxa have something in their kit that is like this a possible drawback something related to their lore that impacts the way their kit works i guess they might be harder to think of stuff for but still that part seems imbalanced to me im not gonna get on my high horse about it sets a bad precedent because its their game and they can do what they want theyll think theyre allowed to do this again its their game what if they put an insane gp on a character you hate i will never pull for a character i do not like they may never do another gp again and fearmongering for the hypothetical future gps being required when we dont know where else this may take us is a bit much for me i get why people are worried about this hypothetical but even castorices doesnt look required so idk why people are saying not having these characters will brick their accounts the lack of s with good kits is bricking the game way more than this imo because you have few to no alternatives for the abundance of limited
if you are one of those slippery slope people who genuinely believes that castorices global passive means we are getting critatk global passives in the future just quit now you will save yourself time and money in the long run
its not the end of the world its the start of the end of the word
its literally just a revive of the times your healers shielders will be able to outheal outshield most damage unless you arent a late game player the issues will come when they release global passives that are actually useful
i agree with you i played gi since and spent about on that game but i stopped because i didnt have time to play and the story wasnt good anymore dont force yourself to play a game you dont like no matter how much money you spend because there is something more valuable than money which is your time spend your time doing what you like time will never come back
tbh her passive is not tahtbgood anyways but i am more worried that they might give crit or other buffs in future charas which i hope they dont otherwise i think its quite good i wont mind if they keep it limited to anniversaey cahras but still i hope they dont since powercreep is already bad and ngl people will pull even i wanna just cuz she is crazy cool asf dragon purple psychthe
seeing feixiao miss so many crits in the background gameplay hurts
the people on the live stream talking calmly as if they not gonna do worse it pmo
ngl if hsr want to really sell a character that isnt overpowered they can by incorporating proper characterization to the character refined face animations during dialogue high quality model impactful and memorable part in the story etc i dont know if hoyo is just blind and deaf but most people will whale if the character have interesting traits rather than their kit being broken but what do players expect hoyoverse being hoyoslop they are pushing this extreme laziness that they had and induce fomo in a global passive instead literally generating money through wall of text instead of putting effort to actual story content if castorice sells well this just sets a precedent to hoyo that being lazy is okay and they can milk their players whenever they want and saying that it would be a problem once they added combat related global passive is just not it do people not realize how silver wolf sets a precedence to characters applying weakness break whenever they want or acheron having broken multipliers that dps units after her became absurdly broken as well why do people still think that this wont be a problem if they already did it the second time what the saying fool me once shame on me fool me twice shame on you is not enough people still want hoyo to fool them thrice holi hoyo players are sadistic af
this definitely isnt true cause i just did as and had a character die against the bugboss get revived and then die immediately afterwards by another minion bug rofl
marksmanmax yeah hoyo chose very poor wording with the description it suggests they wont die but thats not the reality
yes global passive is not game breaking right now it will be a problem later down the line however dont let that distract you from the very real problems right now story presentation is still bad powercreep is still running rampant and why do we have to wait til for the buffs
it was never about the revive thingy or other additional stats it gives the main problem was the idea of global passive itself most player think thats its alright since the effect it gives is minimal wc is true but its shouldnt be look based on castorice herself it should be look collectively this gives the precedent to release units w global passives its wouldnt be done consecutively but slowly hoyo isnt dumb theyre testing waters
its bad practice lol
its weaker than the su rez blessing its really not that big nor never meant more than a safety net for sacking a crap ton of hp for the hp units they made dont wanna get players to spend their money on a risky playstyle and not have them like it due to the requirment per atk esp if they cant keep up early on image needing this buff outside of hp draining teams thats when you gotta look at your shitty team and ask why did i die in the st place
personally i disagree with a few points even if the devs are going to be making future global passive buffs but theyre miniscule like say a very minor stat buff of attack increase these can all stack and the devs will factor all of these global buffs into their endgame content and possibly even future characters kits and balance it around them which of course makes the hp inflation and powercreeping even worse than it is to also tell players that feel they have been disrespected by the game to just quit is terrible advice because that is not going to change the game for the better or make it improve this is only good advice to those that feel hsr has crossed a line and they cant continue with it anymore and you should have phrased that better additionally saying that hoyo could have ruined the game at any point by adding predatory pay to win mechanics because they know can get away with it and saying the passive worth stressing over is incredibly short sighted and not providing any solutions to the powercreep situation not to mention considering hoyo is seen to be the top mobile gacha company that every other gacha game is striving to take even a of their profits whose to say this wouldnt trickle down to future gacha games and become a trend and before anyone says that those games would be eosd after genshins release there started having an influx of copycat games with the similar concepts and copy pasting the relic system with its shitty layers of rng which many players complained to be a shitty mechanic but now its a trend last of all what if those global passives introduces some unbalanced mechanic unrelated to stat increases but still affecting combat gameplay its definitely possible lets assume this when insert _ is in the team increase hits on every allys ultimate attacks by meaning acherons ult for example would be doing attacks on her ult instead of her usual its still a terrible precedent to set because it opens up way too many bad mechanics that can break even more of hsrs rules
yait could open the door for hoyo to implement a game defining global passivebut have they done it yetwill they do itthen complain after they show signs of it being taken
the thing is not the passive effectits the global passive in general do we have the urgency that we really need thisno we dont so with this in mindhoyo need to balance powercreephp inflation and possible global buffgood luck hoyoand for the casuals defending thismake sure you guys dont rage quit for the difficulty spike because the spike will happen and not just end game contentexpect the same for story tooand good luck on teambuilding toothis buff alone kinda breaks the team composition and value of sustainswho need sustain when you have this passiveand for the accounts that dont have castoricewell sucks to be you
its like myrtle from arknights the game changes so much because of her but the main difference is shes a star if hoyo in the future release a global passive star with broken effect that changed the game then thats a problem unless its a free star
looking forward to phainons accountwide free crit rate and everyone with castorice on their accounts getting hypocritically mad about it after telling hoyo that global passives are ok if they do that you can only blame yourself and you better not complain
the thing that worries me is that hsrs gameplay is very simple as they release more global passives it will be hard to avoid either actual buff that improve a teams performance by a decent amount they could always thread the needle but its fucking hoyo soo synergy between seemingly innocuous global passives that then makes them much more powerful when you own a certain combination of characters say hyacines passive gives a party wide heal whenever someone dies which allows a character revived by cas passive to not die again even if you dont have a sustain either way its introducing more potential problems when devs should be focusing on fixing existing problems if hoyo had accrued a good reputation when it comes to managing things that can introduce fomo and treated players fairly overall i would not be overly worried about this but again its hoyo mark my words well soon see a boss that can oneshot a party member without fail unless you interact with a very annoying mechanic of said boss and youll watch every cas owner just shrug it off regardless of the team they play while the others will scramble to deal with it or have to use fucking bailu
broo having castorice on the account will always save you from losing one star due to fallen character in moc it affects late game performance associated rewards thereby solidifying her as a must pull you pull or you lose has never been more true the crazy part is that it works even when shes not on any of your moc teams
civil discussion lesgoo
its a global buff because shes the wife just kidding i agree that shed be perfect with just the onfield version of the same skill
blown over proportion its just a horse armor its just skin its just loot boxes its just battlepasses its just for a character its just for a skin you dont understand other issues are character flaws that makes eidolon more desirable this is making characters must have because sometimes getting extra turn alive means victory for weaker players and stronger players can abuse this more easily castorice will suffer because of this because if she didnt have a global effect she would get a lot more this is hoyoverse they have no self control
i mean its really not out of our hands technically that makes it just sound like you have little faith in the hsr community which is kinda valid considering how hoyolab is rn but atill pessemistic also can someone save this video and send it back to him when he gets proven wrong this video will age like milk i am certain
theres nothing thematic in a character based around the concept to death to revive it is literally the complete opposite
i would pull only because of passive she ugly and want same team as herta so point like devs could ruin game any time doesnt work them trying to ruin it right now
while i agree with of what you said everybody here is missing one crucial detail the western community makes up the vast minority of the playerbase with the vast majority of the complaints if you look at the things that did get addressed and changed it were all things that cn players complained about portrayel of story enhanced through animations hard moc nikador mechanics are so abusable im sorry tackled by reducing total hp in the next one buffs to older characters to balance out powercreep etc we are not the target audience as stupid of an arguement as it may sound the cn players love their exclusive stuff and if you go look at their comments about our reactions they are mostly making fun of us xd their reaction to the global was also rather positive of course with some concerned for the future but nothing close to the wide spread hopeless doomposting we are experiencing here there is obviously the big evil what if hanging in the air and i totally understand that but who here is actually stupid enough to think they would do that when madam hertas and acherons techniques have more total value to your account than this global passive and some entire character kits combined and i saw no complaints about those if they wanted to add this into the game or market future characters more efficiently they got a ton of other way less controversial methods of doing that the passive is so ridiculously useless due to needing a heal otherwise you automatically die on the next turn its only there for flaire the reason i am commenting so negatively over something so seemingly reasonable is because its becoming really exhausting to see all this doomposting and negativity achieve literally nothing but ruin the enjoyment of others trust the devs a little more hoyo is not a multi billion dollar corporation for nothing and if you cant trust them because there is nothing to trust them for then dont interact with their products and quit the game its that easy
i think whats important to notice at is the way they are testing the waters by masking the passive under tons of layers as youre saying its just a tiny thing in her kit that is already so hyped she is a highly anticipated waifu and with some of the best animations in the game and i think this is hoyos strategy testing the waters by attaching a passive under many many layers of possible playerbases defenses its a very insignificant effect no big deal its because of lore how dare you criticize my waifu if they tested the waters by giving global passive to a character thats not desirable people would raise pitchforks on top of that its anniversary and they are giving lots of other things like giving freebies free stars everything to shift the focus away from the passive and its clearly working of course this is a pessimistic look but i dont know if we can trust that hoyo wont follow through on this to open the floodgates with castorice where people will even defend it and then start selling less hyped characters just on their passives another reason why im pessimistic is that this reminds me a ton about another situation that already happened in star rail that we are suffering from right now ruan mei was stupidly busted even on release raising the damage floor of pretty much all teams in the game if you complained about her power back then youd be shunned its no big deal its only the first limited harmony unit so she has to be strong it makes sense lorewise how dare you criticize a woman that virtually touched me shut up were getting free ratio and then suddenly hp creep happens making not using rm feel like shit and then acheron happens and then robin firefly feixiao herta waves of hp inflation oh and now were complaining about powercreep powercreep wasnt a big deal either when ruan mei released according to some people of course does the global passive situation have to follow the same course not necessarily but it can go downhill easily if they decide to and they are clearly pushing the boundaries with this one
lets play a game complete the phrase when dan heng was released a lot of people had concerns for powercreep what was the cope right oh they wont make it worse its a oneoff thing or will be very rare when triple banners became a thing when it had like a bis team what was the cope right oh they wont make it worse its a oneoff thing or will be very rare when global passives became a thing a lot of people had concerns what was the cope i stopped paying them money long ago but i guess instead of trying to win me over they decided to go the very opposite way of trying to squeeze these dollars outta me unfortunately for them i have self respect fuck this game and anything hoyo does i have no idea how can anyone be willing to be a legit paying pig with how abhorrent this monetisation is little to no reinvestment into this game they even stall the fucking multiplier buff to old characters for more months as if its so hard probably right when fate collab drops and hp meta goes out of scope so that buffed blade would be ass nice one hoyo fuck you
you might not be a shill but youd be a moron to think this isnt a problem better make a video saying you were wrong when they start adding more of these global passives her revive is still a literal problem it could potentially change the way you play example you find yourself in a situation where the character your controlling could die and the safe bet would be to use sp and kill the remaining mob but you see the potential in doing a basic to bank more sp thus you basic and get the sp and die the person with castorice on their account has the option to snag that sp and let the character die even if it cost sp later to get them alive its still banking it for a time that better suits them the person without castorice doesnt has a bigger gamble on their hands
the problem isnt that the account wide passive res isnt that powerful in the current meta yes if you have a fully leveled and built team then if they die in endgame content youre doing something wrong or got unlucky the problem is if and when endgame changes to reflect the global passives we already see this happening with the aoe meta hamstringing hunt characters now you have to have the passive revive buff because theres a mechanic where the boss oneshots you or the boss dmg numbers are so high your sustain cant keep up with it and i mean premium sustains like aventurine and lingsha i was and am much more worried about the global passive than something like mydeis autobattle because his autobattle didnt actually affect his viability as a dps in the content hes intended for at e the worst part is i dont even think this will change how much money they get the vast majority of people will still pull for the same amount of characters but now theyre forced to choose between pulling for a meta character they dont like because if they dont they wont clear endgame or pulling for a character they loved and falling behind
this is what i keep telling people who are doomposting over it they wont add offensive or flat stat global passives they are a profit company and they should know that adding those would be too greedy theyre trying to limit test to see how much they can get away with and with recent backlash they know that global passives are not it people are blowing it out of proportion
im a simple gacha gamer i see unit i like i get i see unit i dont like i dont get but on serious note if theyre gonna increase the hp at least increase the cycles or make universal gameplay mechanics
i agree if global passives start to explode the powercrep even more then its a sign that the game is over and to turn in the towel
yes but isnt other guy getting one as well
yeah not the end of the world meanwhile new datamined characters have global passives oh boy oh boy sure cant wait for a global passive in between hoyo games
her passive is the beginning of the end
i think makes a lot of sense they dont even have a way to verify if worked or not in castorice case her banner sales would only reflect coolness of her kit and her waifu value since a lot of people already think of her as the main waifu of the patch like they did with firefly you cant test waters if this characters has an impossible rate of failure because shes the greatest waifu from amphoreus this is until elsya came out had they put this in someone like anaxa i would believe more that is a test of waters
thank you i think this hot take is way more reasonable than everyone fearmongering over a mustpull meta that hasnt even happened yet heres my hot take those claiming that this will kill hsr are killing the game faster than global buffs ever will
its not the end of the world yet
no this is exactly the beginning of the end dont you dare to sugar coat it by saying its not they in their enourmous greed really said how can we make more money oh i know lets do a genshin will this decission piss off players we dont care we want money they had chances to say maybe its not a great idea to implement this type of mechanic into a game already filled with powercreep that makes any mmo tremble but no they dove head first into this decision toghether with every castorice simp and people who dont understand that this change is beyond bad this game already has a huge issue with the powercreep units that do everything like its a normal tuesday bosses with almost million hp by now and no viable star options besides march and gallagher its so bad that they are forced yet again to bait these brainless and spinless players with a free star now and another in the future are all of you who are defending this thing by saying oh its just pve get over it really that idiotic if yes i hate to break it to you you are idiots i just hope the eu enforces those laws against predatory monetization and knocks these types of companies down a few meters into the mud to stop i will really want to see who is gonna spend in these games anymore when you see the prices of the pulls
for me well ive already taken a long break from the game on account of the lack of english voice acting that said the issue with powercreep and this global passive is incredibly worrying ive invested so much time and money into this game and its a shame to see it go down a route that seems incredibly predatory im hoping youre right and this ends up not being that big of a deal its just that it seems like yet another step in the wrong direction
just make her free ez
i strongly agree i think its dumb but its whatever it certainly wont kill the game much less when theyve announced a lot of very good positive changes as well that people dont focus on as much as this they just love drama the amount of times ive heard something was gonna kill this or that game and i was able to keep playing with no difference complaints are fine i submit feedback too and devs proved they do listen theyre gonna try hard to sell you the new units sure just like always this is a business people but the game is far from dead thats just clickbait
stop the cap
basically youre saying youre ok with them if they dont give you damage i guess youre just naive thinking this is not coming the whole time youre treating it as a theoretical its not a theoretical its innevitable i can already see your future surprised pikachu face when its coming you can keep walking the tight rope that has a big tear in the middle of it eventually it will snap and you will fall along with all the other shills better wear a big smile on your way down
yeah no im out of here
idk if anyone will read my comment or not but im going to say it anyway where hsr may go is probably the same track with hird where powercreep is at its worst and old s ranks star equivalent characters are not only unusable but literally forgotten to the point hoyo gives them for free it has already started with ruan mei and luocha and they will probably continue for me global buffs are definitely broken and maybe should not be in the game and i will agree if it is the case for a game with pvp feature the thing is hsr is a single player game and theres literally no need for competitiveness to enjoy it so global buffs meant nothing but having an easier time clearing endgame contents if youre worried about not getting every jades from moc apoc and pf then get what you can and strategize your pull no ones forcing you to pull every characters no ones forcing you to top up and no ones forcing you to clear every endgame content so just do your own thing in it ans if you dont enjoy it anymore just leave it if you ask me what if in the future hoyo releass a global buff to increase critspdatketc will i pull for all of them then my answer is no i will not pull all of them i will still pull only the characters i want and like like i said no ones forcing you to have meta characters and you dont have to clear every endgame content i will keep enjoy it in my own way i literally dont understand this drama cause why are you all worrying when you dont even need to be competitive in this game and castorice will probably get powercreep again in the future this is a gacha game with honkai in its title if you dont play hi then just know that the powercreep is gonna get worse so be prepared and do your math for your pulls because i do i am mostly fp except for getting monthly once every a few couple of months so i have to calculate my pulls and truly think which character i want to prioritize theres no such thing as a must pull character only a collectively agreed overpowered character that meta slave player use to compare their accounts with other to make themselves feel better for having the character once again you dont need to clear endgame content theres no rule or prerequisites that mention such thing if youre worried about not getting enough jades strategize your pull its as simple as that
its the beginning of the end
people who are stupid mostly are people who get easily manipulated by blatant practices and have zero foresight ability
idk this video seems kinda naive to me
i generally agree with this sentiment it was an inevitability that theyd try this at some point if that was their intention castorice just happened to be the one they tried it on and its not like they need to see how players will respond considering the company were talking about but i cant help but think if its true they did this because it thematically fits the character couldnt they have given this global passive as a reward for clearing the story like a castorices blessing key item that or give the character for free for those who are playing the patch to allow a more equal playing field tying it to if you gamble and either get lucky or invest enough to guarantee a pull sets a pretty sketchy precedent i hope in the event they include more global passives like this one theyre very minor things that dont provide too strong an advantage but i doubt it
finally ive found someone who just dont hate hate like it aint a big deal nor game breaking
i think there shouldnt be global effects you either have them on the team or not i however am not going to rage over it have more important things to do in life
be careful into making videos on topics like these i dont want the usual suspects trying to harass you over a gacha game
if you guys think this global passive is going o break the game what about acheron technique or getting the herta that can make ur sudu experience much easier or ruan mei that can make you recive broken rewards from her occurences those are not global buffs or fei xiao that makes adventure domains free rewards without any effort
i perused through the comments and it feels like of the people are commenting based on the title alone so many bring up points that were already addressed in the video we all understand the precedent this sets theres no need to make a comment separately pointing it out the point of this is that at this very moment the global passive is inconsequential as this video points out hoyo could ruin the game even more than they already have at any point in time these gacha devs are not benevolent saints they do not care about player satisfaction beyond the bare minimum required to keep them hooked if the game is no longer enjoyable for whatever reason i urge people to quit at the end of the day this is a luxury entertainment product this game is not a contractual obligation anyone can uninstall the game within seconds and never touch it again and thats why i agree with this video that endlessly worrying about what could be is just needlessly exhausting in the video states but if a new character comes out with a damage buff global passive id draw the line there and i am in agreement even the most minuscule damage or stat buff whether it be atk crit res pen or even break effect or effect res and that is where id firmly draw the line of it being unacceptable no matter how small a direct stat buff would be completely unacceptable and i would forever quit the game i love minmaxing with relics and stats in this game so the idea of a direct global stat buff from a character disgusts me and yes i know about the rumors of several upcoming characters having said stat buffs as their global passives i will be keeping an eye on leaks to see if that ends up being the case
to cry babies cry some more about the global passives it makes me feel good
its nothing special yeah about that i thought about this for a while and ive come to the conclusion that hoyo can use this g passive to justify implementing more enemies that can shot you that might not sound bad at first but remember not everyone has enough money to guarantee a star thats a possible pulls after all so not having castorice means you wont be able to complete moc from here out not until you get a character that can bypass bs shot kill mechanics which theyre already implementing with the new dead dragon boss i might add and this is going to be the new route hoyo can take going forward need to make the game harder without increasing hp just create more global passives and reasons why you need them drop the copium
these are the kind of videos i subbed for even if i didnt click on the video agreeing with it initially glad ur still making vids
""
yea man i need to get phainon because he gives the whole team a atk buff while not in the team or the future break support that lets you deal additional super break dmg or when a new march appears her passive makes enemys freeze every turns
global passives will not be good for new players who want to play in the future their account will be at a huge disadvantage compared to accounts that have global passives stack on their account
thank you finally someone understands the situation clearly thank you for explaining this matter as simply as possible
saw this in hi seeing this in hsr co incidence i think not
i dont think anybody was complaining about the revive itself its just that the games meta will become solely dependent on global passives i am of the belief that if something happens once it will happen again so i dont think hoyo is never going to this again even if the entire player base are severely against it
no this is about revenue and not at all about lore the devs are definitely thinking if hi can get away with it then why not hsr unfortunately cn doesnt seem to mind the way that global does and therefore i see them pushing this further in the future the game has honestly been on a nose dive trajectory for a while now and if they dont make an effort to turn it around soon i might just quit ive already decided im going fp because of the castorice situation not that theyll miss my per month but hopefully there are enough quitters and sudden fps to make them notice
see gacha smack already talked about this brother its not a matter of oh its just a revive and itll leave you on hp so its not that strong its a matter of if you accept and allow them to push this bull through next time it can be something actually more game breaking for example we could be getting implant sametype weakness on all enemies when one enemy has a weakness implanted followup attacks deal x more damage when allies consume hp with their skills consume xx flat amount of hp once more when skill points are consumed increase damage dealt by x or something like increase crit rate by as global passives power creep will get even worse than it already is which is saying a lot
im with you on this one ill wait for the real reason to quit this game i mean people complained during acherons banner that it could have a bad precedent but even at x shes still the only one with a mob killing skill if they ever introduce a gamebreaking global passive that would ruin the game for me then yeah ill easily drop this game but for now im still enjoying the game
my main reason for not liking global passive is the fact that it feels like an insult to previous emanators like there is no lore reason why those shouldnt get a global passive if castorice is getting one it feels super especially since the lack of lore reason allows hoyo to spam global passive if they so wish which sucks for emanators it is very likely that well get them based on paths without emanators currently since they heavily really on same path characters right so thats one level of safety combine this with the fact that they are the most gifted people in the entire universe second only to aeon like theyll be rare for sure and no one would question why an emanator is so game breaking cus they always are anyways tbh there isnt even that big of a reason to release herta on apart from the fact that she needs to be there before tribbie and anaxa idk couldnt they have changed thigs up ill be more accepting if it makes sense why a character is op and not just oh we like this waifu and we want to push her to be the center of attention i like castorices design but the way they did her kit makes it feel like they want to desperately shove her into peoples face without any based reason like blade also has a part of an abundance emanator you definitely gonna give him castorices global passive when buffing him right dev anyways nice vid sorry for being a hoyo hater
yep people are just exposing themselves for not paying attention to the video and getting rewarded because this community wants to fearmonger people for choosing to look at this situation with nuance and not complete negativity
e r e c t
it should just be unusable in end game mods
it would be great if they implemented an option to use or not use the global passives so you can decide which ones do you prefer or if you dont want to play with those passives
all i can say is hoyo likes cas ass
people are just freaking out its nothing surprising hsr players are hypocrites for not wanting powercreep but then doomposts when one is too weak
i bet bladillion dollars that this video wont age well
this community is always blowing things out of proportion im just gonna play the game and keep it moving
dont underestimate star rail players theyll somehow see one slippery slope fallacy and dismiss the amazing things were getting for as cover ups because they cant enjoy anything regardless though great take enjoy the good deal with the bad when its actually here
glad i quit when fugue came out so i dont have to be a part of this circus called hoyoverse
that not the problem its the door for more of those global passives later that could be worse
this idiot thinks hes above the rest
it should be a one time thing for castorice and it was added for lore reason even if this was true which i highly doubt it they didnt need it to make it a global passive or they didnt need it to make it active in the end game content also about future characters not having global passive sorry but yeah this is just wishful thinking spoiler leaks saber for the collab and phainon where leak to have a global passive
never understood why yall are hating on this oh but its predatory the game still has to make money youre still gonna play it and if youre not why not stfu its just an arguably dumb debate if you really hate it just quit go to a more generous game like limbus company
this is not just about her passive never was
bro summed up my whole opinions on this in mins for u to be that mad abt a passive being in the game u either are doing this as ur job or u rlly dont have much going on in ur life
next global passive will be and worthless until you get used to the idea of global passives and then incrementally end up at or and by then the argument will be if youve been playing hsr for this long you should already have enough of a cumulative global passive that surpasses so its really not that big a deal plus its only so yeah its a big deal theyll just keep incrementally cranking the heat like they always do agreed with the message of the video just quit if you want sunk cost fallacy is not worth it
honestly a welcomed passive cuz when fighting the weekly feixiao boss with aventurine or gallagar on auto somehow a character will die every runs
but its the start of the doom
its weird that any people who are not responding to it as badly are praised and being said as reasonable always a big logical fallacy in the gacha community people are responding to it badly because of hoyo themselves treating the players as bad which wouldnt happen if they treat us better and its not about castorices passive but its about how rulebreaking it is while not being necessary at all what else are trying to do with it squeeze peoples money theyre not even trying to improve gameplay or create another strategy this mechanic is pure braindead if you dont trust me just play the game and see it for yourself in the long run
i felt better after this
the reason why global passive is so problematic is that it requires no skill in this supposed strategy game and hsr is already very limited in strategy it will become a collect and buy game removes all sense of strategy and make the game unbalanced in the long run the game will just become strictly a character check game global passives are also flexible enough so the devs can break any rules they want to fit their predatory marketing
i find it hilarious that whenever the devs of mihoyo do something that is clearly will cause problems in an objective viewpoint the community will bend over backwards trying to defend it weve seen time and time again in genshin and some of the players ran to hsr because of it and now the very same players are ok with this because genshin could never effect hsr is on its way to become possibly worse than genshin now because of the potential pitfalls of global passives and soon zz will be on the next chopping block
the thing is that power creep is getting very very bad in hsr and while this may not be an issue the future characters are gonna make it even worsesince this has just become a contest between chars on who can do the most outrageous and stupidly op thing
i feel like this is one of the few responses to this whole debacle thats been measured and reasonable while everyone is panicking for no reason
nah dude its bad no matter what you say
you have very narrow minded thinking if youre only thinking about castorices global passive instead of looking at the big picture
its not the fact that castorices global passive is not the end of the world its the fact that global passive now exist in the game and in future there will more global passive characters now imagine in the future buffs are getting stacked over each other from multiple characters
i wish these doom poster can just quit the game and shut up genshin constantly get backlash but after year still top revenue every month their opinion is useless they start to sound like those dumb sjw on x maybe they are the same ppl lol
i would accept global passive if every character including released ones get one and they dont have significant impact on gaming but i dont think this is the direction we are going toward
buddy they made a unique icon and everything for it they are going to add more in the future best to just call it out now instead of later when its too late it may be too late already tbo
honestly id argue global passives are less predatory than existing gacha mechanics because they let you boost your account without pulling for powercreep characters
im not mad about the revive its honestly a nice touch to tie into her divine authority as the chrysos heir of thanstos butwhy tf is it global why
i do agree that her global passive isnt really a big gameplay issue but why did they give one to her in the first place since it doesnt even match her thematically to have it imo i havent finished the story yet so i may be wrong
but why was it global thats what bugs me whats the ooint of it working when shes not on the team
this is weird why do you hate castorice global passive if castorice wasnt in the party when bailou do the exact same thing revive one downed character automatically once per battle and that passive isnt working if bailou is not in the line up
if theres a global passives that increase base stats and talent lv increase then that will be the serious problem
i immediately right click on your video and click the dont recommend the channel
not the end of the world yet
is this the end of hsr no my guess is that the next patch will make sales skyrocket also i dont think that people are exagerating hsr is a game that have devs killing their own game systems the game have an elemental system that with the release of sw they tried to kill that system and since acheron the system became dead acheron started the saga of self suficient dps units that could ignore the elementalbreak bar system and after her a lot more units like that followed with castorices will be the same the precedent is there and we players of hsr or even mihoyos game know really well the company or at leasts should the fact that there are leaks of a global passive new ui already says what they intend to do also with castorice they are going to kill the base of team building in hsr because now the teams are not units anymore the teams will be units all global passives avaliable also they are taking away from the player the choice of choosing what units to pull
it is what it is
they deliberately chose to give castorice the global passive because they they know shes a desirable unit that way they can justify putting more global passives by saying well castorice was profitable knowing but ignoring the fact that she sold well because people love her not the passive imo star rails gameplay was doomed from the start its too simplistic compared to other turnbased games so they have to think of more new mechanics to set characters apart breaking the rules too much and causing powercreep
i think its a bad sign just as acheron was that sets precedence for worse powercreep i dont blame people for quitting
global passives are unacceptable
this is a micro step to a disaster many new char will have global passive and ofc they will first not have a broken passive as they want us to get used to it
disagree its not dumb at all
lets all work hard giving bad reviews and telling hoyo to remove the existence of global passives in the game
lets say that youre completely right on this why should anyone be ok with global passives what do we gain from not being hostile towards the devs for adding this if anything overreacting helps us more than anything else
not the end of the world because this is just them testing the water in the future what can we get as guarantee that they wont add cyrene auto delete enemies hp when you start the battle affect all endgame or march action advance the whole team for when you start the battle affect all endgame endgame will be balanced around the newest characters hoyo have made it clear on that in the past year if this passive go through and players just went meh not the end of the world then the next year we can try to balance our account around global passive that add up a bunch of qol in endgame content which is the primary source of income in this game including sudu which is only once a week and every patches yes but even sudu is replacing events now you will feel how miserable it is to clear those if you dont have the shilled characters because you have to pull for others for their global passive of course we can hope that this is just a one time thing a castorice unique and special effect but even acheron their mei got all the special parts of her kit distributed around later characters nothing is unique in this game you either go with their meta or you play for the storycollect characters for your dollhouse i dont think castorice passive is the end of the world its the pandora box that it will open frankly every characters need their lc and maybe e support now if i have to pull for characters that previously i might get to skip just because of the passive later on then id rather quit and enjoy my time elsewhere this is greed and they are showing you just how much greedier they can get believe them before the sunk cost fallacy get to you
she doesnt need it they just wanted to break another record
im just glad this is finally here i am so sick of this conversation no matter how it played out until the day comes where hsr releases something completely bonkers then and only then but for now its tiring its just a freakn revive but hoyo isnt dumb i highly doubt they will release a bonkers global passive
in noway this isnt a test yes people are pulling cas regardless but it also signifies that its ok to add more global passives in the future because unlike beta testers or people who read leaks the ones that dont which are most of the playerbase dont really care about the games balance most of them dont even play endgame oh you clearly dont how hoyo works just like genshin their games are always at its best in the first years while slowly pushing the boundary along the way and the moment they realize that players are hooked and wont stop playing no matter what god forbid whatever scummy moves theyll throw at us to push the revenue id say the critisism is justified its not that theyre worried of something that hasnt happended yet that something has already happended a mediocre global passive is still a global passive regardless i played this game since and already spent a bit saw how seriously they were willing to take feedback and thought this time itll be different thisll be better than how they treat their genshin players guess in the end its still a hoyos game afterall and i dont think zz will be any different in a year
maybe the reall issue is that no one wants to quit everyone is too far deep so they want the game to get better but when things like this happen they cant just leave and return they take it out on community members my two cents is to remember you wont waste your money if you decide to stop and as a fp you havent wasted your time gacha games are just games leave and come back when you want too or never you arent going to die if you miss out
nah id quit
sure this specific passive is not the end of the world but its opening doors to worse things
future timeline global passives giving damage boosts etc will massively increase powercreep eventual hp inflation hoyo finally sees the issue and caps global passive to x amount selectable to be active its a quick fix that still leaves players disgruntled but at least the game would still be playable for endgame
end game content like simulated universe or memories chaos please add in your team
it will trigger something even worse in the future i know not many people using bailu unless they have no healer other than her but with this global passive her existense is irrelevant might as well just delete her from the game at this point and yes more in the future the powercreep already bad as it is and yet they add one more checkboxes for it
i appreciate that you are a rational and reasonable thinker
when itll be too late all we will see is surprised pikachu face
look adding a global passive makes the concept and system behind them a feature in the game if the charackter goes live like this there will be more and you can definetly be sure its not just gonna be a bunch of revival passives at first a revive next more energy regen then a little bit of attack and soon enough all your charackters might be stronger simply because you posess all the right units on your account this is not pandoras box the box is opened as soon as it goes live i
guarantee that they wont add no you wont never had and wont even if this would be removed even wont from any other company either this is the biggest reason why worrying about this is less than pointless the reality is that it is always a possibility and anything is possible if you play a game of ifs
its the beginning of the end
who actually here is stupid enough to think theyd do that xd if they wanted to sell you a character they could do a lot more effective things than that
like
if i die even once during castorice update because of bosses being op for us to force to get castorice hoyo is getting sued
if you know you know is all ill say its not good
as they said the door has always been open we just never entered it they couldve made tribbie e global but they didnt thankfully they could make gp exist even from version nothing was stopping them
liyern if you play the game you know those leaks are fake af a speed global passive would brick your account for example so theres no way theyd release a unit with one unless they want to lose a ton of money
ganon leaks say otherwise thats why i said if you know you know
liyern as i said those leaks are fake which is obvious if you actually play the game theyd never release a unit with a spd passive that unit would brick your account if you pulled them your intentionally slow units would be bricked and youd have to redo the speed tuning for all your teams
ganon ok
ganon this is hoyo that we are talking about they are not to be trusted with this power because they are proven to not listen to their community and push things to get more money look what happens to genshin with their own version of powercept it is going to be worse because i dont believe hoyo would not take that step forward
soullessky why would hoyo intentionally want to make players skip their unit and lose out on millions of dollars this would cause them to lose a ton of money due to people skipping an account bricking unit
ganon because this is a gacha game they going to start off slow and try to get people used to this before striking to get as much money as possible this is how the powercept will start trust me they are going to brick people accounts in the future even if you dont see it right away
soullessky i dont think you get what im saying im saying the leaks make no sense because one of the passives would brick your account its an incentive to not pull the unit and not spend money since again a spd buff would brick your intentionally slow units and spd tuning if you pulled the unit on accident your account would be bricked so you cant even build pity if you otherwise wanted to pull the unit due to designmeta etc you cant anymore since again the spd passive would brick your account all im saying is that these leaks are obvious fake because hoyo wants to make money not lose it hoyo is known to be greedy why would they brick your account if you decided to spend money to pull
ganon it doesnt matter what leak say or dont say hoyo did powercept genshin so why wouldnt they do the same here there will be a powercept so painful that many will stop playing look at how they treat their other games they dont care at all about us so they will try this because they are that greedy and dumb to think it will work
it shouldnt be global its totally stupid only when shes on the team saying its a slippery slope is valid criticism i dont think this is getting overblown
ok here me out if they had to make a character with a global passive that buffs damage and crit they should do a star and put them in a permanent event where everyone can get them for free that way people wont need to pull for a limited star they might not want just for a global passive they need and with everyone having a global damage buff this could potentially allow people to use older characters whos damage is lacking compared to newer characters
hoyoshill
the buff to blade is that he gets a global passive that allows everyone to deal a bladillion damage
your devils advocate line doesnt work with the fact that this is a global passive and it doesnt relate to how just getting this character does this to your account this isnt something cool or thematic if so itd be something easily added as a normal passive instead if this isnt them testing the waters i dont know what is i feel that this is a bad test though given people will pull this character regardless
its not about castorice global passive alot of people already said its was not that op the problem is its open a pandora box that can and will slippery slop did you really think hoyo who cant manage powercreep and hp inflation can manage global passive oh look there a new char that will not sell well what we have to do lets add global passive so that people will be pressured to pull it always start wit small thing like this
they def do be thinking that the death ability of castorice will be killing it especially the games life expectancy
hoyoshills gotta shill eh cant wait to see excuses from john hoyos bootlickers like you when even worse passives are gonna be introduced
the issue about presedent isnt really that they can do it obivously they can do anything its that it shows how they are now willing to do it really the only way this could have possibly went down well is if they assured that global passives would only be small gimmicky things like this and saved for special occasions does seem like my choice to competlely skip hsr has been repeatedly vindicated over the years though i do hope they dont remain the only hoyo game to buff old units and move old limiteds to standard
i largely agree with your points in the vid definitely not a fan of the whole global passive concept unless its something benign like how in genshin some characters mark items on the minimap or reduce currency costs when leveling weapons in the grand scheme though i dont think her revive will have a significant impact on combatfocused content so i hope nobody feels pressuredforced to pull her but hopefully this is just a oneoff since castorice is the big anniversary character thats been hyped up since her debut and so the devs just wanted to give her the extra special treatment
okey so i think it depends mainly whether endgame is going to be balanced around it or not if it becomes hard to the point its a necessity to have these passives then yeah trash addition but if its balanced as usual then i think it could be okay because of reasons like giving a nudge to teams using older characters to keep up as well as being a powercreep countermeasure imagine if in the future castorice becomes super powercreeped she would still have her usefulness because of this revive even if you dont use her these are the kind of things that could happen if they dont balance endgame around these passives the other extreme would be that if they release too many passives and still dont balance endgame around it players could snowball through endgame making it a breeze depending on how game changing they are all in all it would be better if they didnt add them but if they do they should be few and far in between
this precedent is unnacceptable to be set regardless of whether or not its gamebreaking on its own or not because since this is now a thing that they are willing to do there will be more
castorices revive doesnt bother me because the people who feel like they need to pull her because of it probably should just get or upgrade their current sustain options
i think its very easy to be dismissive of these until they end up stacking like a dozen different effects its just the revive its just speed its just cd its just some attack until not whaling all of them means youre essentially playing with relics
castorices global passive isnt dumb it will only be dumb if most characters have it making them very mandatory if you want to win endgame
if a free character that everyone gets for free has a global passive that majorly affects the battle its fine if the character is locked behind a banner and has the same global passive we have a problem
it wont be a bit issue because youll almost never encounter it bar mhy making more oneshot bosses or you running sustainless but the issue comes in the form of the future and what this opens up for mhy but theres an easy fix make it not work wo cast iron rice on the team make it not work in mocpfas its that simple you just made a bullshit passive w ambiguous implementation going forward into something perfectly fine and unique to a character a la acherons overworld instakill but this is hsr mhy were talking about theyre not exactly known for being consumer friendly or not taking a mile when given an inch lmao
im fine with the global passive but only because i hope they listen to us and take it out and give us compensation jades
good opinion
hoyoshills are out of their mind the cope is insane dude pls seek help
global nerf passive
so k
cant wait for my feixiao to do k dmg on ult
the global passive makes that healing kills all destruction character
he just wants to justify pulling castorice lol
what of course it will be balanced around all the new units with more and more overpowered passives hsrs whole endgame exists to force player to pull new characters yet you still coping that these wont be important at all lmao no wonders game is in the worst possible state toxic positivity and delusional fans destroyed it
marcuskane dude im not even pulling for castorice if end game gets too hard then i say fuck it and just play the story which is what im here for i genuinely dont think anyone started playing honkai because they of their thirst for moc or pf and if you cant beat it then so be it just be a casual you will appreciate it in the long run and hoyoverse will have a smaller consistent playerbase and less people willing to spend because it wont matter in the long run if characters are going to be powercrept its on them not on me the delusional player who actually thinks of all the possibilities rather than assume the outcome
maybe play limbus company then
the are already planning to make must pull globals i think saber is going to have damage buffing capabilities based on the current leaks if it was simply them doing this to one character and thats it the backlash wouldnt have been as thunderous however we know they are planning others and they are all stat buffs they are small rn but they will absolutely increase them judging how different anaxa is to silver wolf its not that people see one thing and freaked out its that they saw what they are doing now what they are planning and knew there was a pretty good chance that they would continue on the path they already started so it was a last ditch effort to stop them from starting down this path and signaling to other companies that they can do with their games as well considering hoyoverse is considered the most successful gacha company currently
honkai star rail named arlans skill shackle breaker and swift harvest so im honestly not surprised theyre ignoring criticism
now that its confirmed im now expecting to see characters w global passives thatll give your account bonus stats critratedmg atk def hp res pen ignore def etc on future updates and i also have a feeling that theyre going to inflate the enemies hp even more in order to adjust to these permanent buffs
i think something should be said about blowing it out of proportion not to disagree with that notion as it is easily the hottest topic out of the upcoming patch with many opinions but there are a lot of reasons as to why its exploded to this degree a considerable part of the community or at least a very vocal part of it is unhappy with the games current direction in various places namely toward feelings of powercreep lack of events or content etc the passive was the icing on the cake and i guarantee it wouldnt have garnered this level of disdain if the other aspects of the game were meeting player satisfaction expectations concerning the video i do agree with the notion that its very much being exploded about people are quitting and stuff over it but the passive is better considered to be a death knell for the commitment of those players assisted with a buildup of the aforementioned unsatisfactory game factors the thing is this passive never had to be globally applicable neither did it need a persistent ui to let you know its active i would argue that yes the passive was thematically and artistically inspired but corporately tampered with the negative press generated by this passive and its severity i would say is just to press an extreme reaction so that hoyoverse would never go as far as to consider more drastic applications to that end if people are genuinely and severely outraging over it then yeah its not worth all of that just leave the game behind however in my eyes theres nothing wrong with an extreme reaction towards a company that makes games with some of the most severe monetary strategies as a core mechanic i mean you can see it in the events itself theres an entire whaling event with that i think its much easier to assume that the passive was more corporately tampered with to this degree rather than the passive just being something cool finally while its true they couldve broken the games balance instantly with an insane passive thats just something they wouldnt do for now theres a reason why the footinthedoor argument is thrown around a lot concerning the passive many would rather have the door shut right now with as much heated discourse as it takes to prevent its potential future prominence in gameplay
you dont get it the problem isnt cast iron rices revive itself which is absolutely not a small thing at all since it procs for each party member its the fact that if she sells well which she definitely will because most hoyo players are brain dead gambling addicts who only care about seeing numbers go up then it means that we will get more global passives and you know for a fact that they will add some really broken ones
nah if this shit was in genshin you guys would be flipping out and saying its the worst thing in the world hsr players are hypocrites
hoyoverse is what every company looks towards for a successful gacha game if people let this slide expect global passives in a bunch of other games in the coming years
i just hope that when they testing the water they will give you a survey so that i can still pull for her and against the global passive
the problem is that people defending this are showing a complete lack of ability to conceptualize second or third order effects it doesnt end with castorices passive theyll be rewarded for this because shell make money because they can get away with it they will do it again and worse
hmm i wanna if there will be vid after the dragon boss moc fight dmg reduction puts u at hp bypasses shield only way to pop bubble is to drain ur hp
honestly this is exactly how i felt about mydeis auto battle lmao
minor misspelling mistake dragon ball z text
hoyo greediness strikes again
i think it is still a test just because its the first of its kind thats why it looks like an overreaction to you cause everyone is worried that if we dont protest theyll use this to justify it being alright
i think the character that gets the most consitent out of her global passive is fu xuan the only thing she cant tank is a nikador without breaking his pillars the global revive allows her to do that now provided you save your ult because halving your hp consumes all charges
instead of focusing on a nothing burger of a passive that barely does anything because of some perceived hypothetical future character with a global passive that provides buffsstats how about we focus on real issues that actually exist in the game right now endgame modes are and have been a literal ad for the new banner unit every rotation for the past year lightcone banner is still not rateup even though most lcs are extremely niche and only work on their respective unit moze was the last they released he came out patches ago wtf sudu expansions have been the same pick the right cards and beat the big boss formula since swarm disaster i havent felt like grinding that shit since gng which came out almost years ago and im sure most people agree i dont mean to shit on sudu enjoyers keep doing your thing theres still no relic loadouts wuwa got echo loadouts when of characters in that game slap on one build and never have to take it off again hsr has specific speed thresholds and tuning and supports have to change builds as they change teams where the fuck are the skins its been years hoyo and no that m skin doesnt count the housing system sucks it gets updates and the longer this goes on the more that hour event feels like a waste of time each patch is gameplay daily login to spend stamina and logout because of this every patch since imo which had gng felt like a filler patch with nothing to do except attempt infinite cycles or whatever people do when they run out of content the only good flagship event since release was the jarilo pokemon event everything since has felt like mindless chores to complete for jadesresinfree lcs
i agree i dont like castorices global buff but honestly i dont see it as much different from any other strategy hoyo and developers of gacha in general use to nudge for pulling one character or another endgame contents and buffs tailormade for new units new support that is better than the previous ones new shiny dps that outperforms the others hoyo is constantly telling you what to pull this is just another strategy players shall keep in mind that they will always be able to skip units with global buffs for the very same reasons they can skip any other new character it wont be the end of the world
i love how literally every x dps has had controversy
also the revived character will die without taking any dmg from enemies if you dont healshield them before their next turn castorice will basically kill them again om her passive is rlly meh yeah lets just see if the next onestheyll definitely make more will also be just quality of life and not straight up dmg increasecope
its generally a good rule of thumb to expect this its also a good rule of thumb to remember a company doesnt care about its customers only profit but i guess most that play this game havent been through enough school or are generally naive
are you actually stupid enough to believe that xd
wedo i agree that companies dont care about their players however if a company actively screws over their players enough they wont have any customers anymore thats why im surprised i feel like theyre creeping closer to losing their playerbase
person in the yt and insta comments the genshin could never resurfaced agains just cuz they treated them with one free star that will be outclassed soon anyway also sure get more seele cons but shell still be subpar even at e not to mention the lack of stars
dying in genshin is much easier though most teams dont use a healer
i havent seen anyone say dont pull castorice if anything the kit leaks made more people want to get her but they were still mad about this i hope you have great pulls and castorice stays relevant for long enough
what was the hertas controversy
shes the cieling breaking dps that introduced more powercreep same as acheron before her
xman ahh k
xman people have issues with every single character that release because this character does this with castorices global passive being the only legitimate complaint the issue isnt that these characters do high damage the issue is that hoyo keeps buffing enemy hp so older and older characters feel weaker and weaker people will complain that robin is better than ruan mei on fua and tribbie is better than ruan mei in aoe teams while ignoring that neither of them compare to ruan mei on break teams because break isnt meta anymore when it is still going strong lol not saying the complaints to castorice arent valid just that there is controversy over every character for existing lol
chadachi true heck while castorice was the first global battle passive she wasnt the first gameplay passive put acheron on the team and she kills small mobs in every area and you wont exactly run of tp snacks anytime soon is the global passive a greedy precedent yes but i also see the old character buffs coming in a few months as non greedy heck the last post launch hoyo buff was zhongli from genshin and that was ages ago now they are doing four all at once the easiest message to send for those that want to send a message is to just not roll andor not use money during her banner it will be on repeat eventually and that lack of income during this period will speak im not going to uninstall the game at a few greedy misteps but if people are okay with uninstalling hey that helps spread the message further
yea it just kinda feels like theyre getting significantly more greedy aglaea and many other units seeing a pretty big performance drop without sunday their sig lcs having an unusually large gap between their best accessible option compared to previous ones and now a global revive passive probably will only get worse from here
chadachi thats literally what i fear these enemies gonna have hinger ho and also insane damage within only a few patches
sweetillusions honestly thats kinda a skill issue because sunday is great but not required sparkle exist bronya exist and about the energy er orb exist
ilikeajaw tried comparing my sparkle vs my sunday for my mydei and using her takes double the amount of cycles to clear while her gear was also significantly more difficult to farm for due to speed requirements and then theres jing yuan who is just borderline unplayable without sunday in modern content and aglaea is decent at a baseline but a completely different unit with him in the team that isnt normal the gap between lcs is also becoming a problem lately with how mydei is very signature or bust as having a near damage difference between your best fp option is an obscene gap and the worst one to date as most past signature lcs are like half that or less
tbf sparkle is just a bad character she is the closest harmony to being a in terms of power because her main gimmick only really does anything for a single character she doesnt even excel at anything in most cases she is a worse bronya because at esunday lc bronya is sp neutral while needing to roll for a lc and bronya herself is free at e if you get her on starter banner e bronya is just that much better because its aa spd boost lol sparkle is just bad shes made for mono quantum which is not viable lol and dhil the latter sunday with s is actually better for thanks to ult giving energy lol
wow a cc with an actual brain refreshing
the problem is not how powerful castorices global passive is the problem is that it sets a precedent for more global buffs which could eventually lead to ones that are incredibly powerful and downright mandatory for endgame
so many gacha tourists dont even realise that many gachas have global account buffs and this castorice passive is nothing compared to those time to filter
re no persistent threat of allies dying i argue it opens up room for more enemy damage powercreep and oneshots akin to highconundrum sudu since they can expect most people will have this free revive again speculation but it is a risk re thematiccoolness gameplay mydeis autoplay doesnt even make thematicstory sense jfc i hate this argument with mydei in particular his story is about agency and learning that he can make his own choices no matter what anyone says so long as hes willing to take the consequences of his own choices removing player agency takes away from this why are we able to play w other characters that have high agency or high political power but not him therta acheron and argenti answer to nobody the trailblaze is literally entirely about paving your own path like mydei boothill is notoriously rebellious mydeis autoplay makes no sense thematically at least feixiaos arguably does but it gives you a greater sense of control on top of being cool instead of taking it away even if its a false sense its not equivalent to we tf they did to mydei i argue that anyone who insists the autoplay was for lore reasons doesnt understand or didnt pay attention to mydeis story lastly they literally couldve just made it a normal passive instead of a global one its been established in story that her curse is proximitybased so why should it work when shes off the team this is our first revive passive on an e limited character which is already quite special even more so cause shes a dps it wont be the end cause casuals wont care and some will pull for other reasons bc this particular passive isnt that bad tbf in a vacuum it is fine i love castorices character and the amphoreus story enough to stay and pull a little but hoyo has lost a lot of my trust and probably a lot of others too the fact that they apparently ignored such negative feedback for both cas and mydei and kept these mechanics indicates that they will not be so receptive to playertester feedback in this department moving forward they can always do whatever they want youre right about that but if they want to keep good reviews and a strong playerbase they need to maintain goodwill with the players and this isnt how they do it keep it up and more will leave or make their dissatisfaction heard
ill agree with what youve present those are good points but i still have some issues with what these global passives might represent something they could do and probably wont is give these passives to more than one character if not all of them including the ones that already exist i saw global passives working on games where we get all character just by farming the game and they give a small amount of base and special stats good enough to have but still not game changer
my take is that as long as they keep to golbal passive active only its not that big a deal id much prefer them to do fp alternatives like some kind of gadget and just reuse the ui elements from the scepters things in su but if you can global passive buff stack im leaving
i am really ready to quit this game i cant stand the idea that castorice is the test subject for hoyo to add global passive to the game like we asked buffs for old characters we like to play not this thing the worst part is casual player who doesnt engage or not have enough knowledge about the implications of castorices future impact on the game is saddening for me i am really tired of this game i was originally going to quit after getting phainon but i dont know i just feel defeated for some reason i like this game but i dont think devs respect me as playercustomer
hoyo has technically played with global passives before in genshin but they were limited to just resources if you owned certain characters then forging certain weapons or enhancing certain weapons would cost less money but they didnt directly influence combat in any way a passive that influences combat when a character isnt in the team feel weird though if they make more passives like this i feel that they should add a selector on which one is active in order to prevent character stacking powercreep
heres the thing like this particular buff is nothing but its literally pandoras box people have been complaining abt it since beta and they refuse to do anything abt it if they dont get enough backlash then they will continue to make more characters with a global passive and they will very very likely stack and not be as useless as castorices they set a precedent people have been saying this for a reason goddamit this video is incredibly shortsighted
i find it very intriguing how hoyo finds new ways to monetize a new waifu what will be the next while x character is on the field all enemies cant target it only by target by aoe
i think this is just an anniversary character thing tbh just cool utility stuff not affecting the dmg of your characters acheron had one shot ability and castorice has a revive
the way i see it its about parity and equity global passive breaks a fundamental rule of the game only active characters can affect battle the more they break their own rules the more disenfranchised players will get baked in weakness implants like firefly and boothill was already a major rule breaking moment we didnt need another one already on just the nd anniversary
we already have leaks of the other passives of upcoming characters and they are actually very useful
shouldnt having her make our run easier why people hate a qol in genshin theres global passive such as double crafting sucrose ayaka double cooking diona jean reduce gold spent raiden wanderer easier local special farming klee tignari and etc etc
of course you shortsighted people might not see this as a major issue a global passive system is fine if its obtainable solely through ingame currency not by swiping your card people may not recognize the problem immediately because its a longterm concern knowing how hoyo operates they definitely wont stop here with castorice its your choice whether to continue supporting the game or not but choose wisely you might end up wasting your time and money on a game that could be dead in the near future
they make a new baseline to promote character in the way of totally powercreep other character in the past this new baseline is beyond comprehend and i think for turn based game its ridiculous
bro this has got to be some of the most brain dead cope take ive heardno the only reason they are doing it is to take away the power of deciding what characters to pull from the players to hoyos hands they dont care about the character only what can they do increase revenue from the player
just letting everyone know that if you quit genshin starrail or zz for days and then come back you will get a return event yes i know it but the daily grinding is exhausted
game quality went down a long time ago and people are still hoping story was badly presented and hp inflation has been happening a long time ago and dont forget at the rate the old units are being power creeped what more do you need to see that the game is going down hill
another thing is that cn servers get million visual artbooks for free while global servers doesnt get any thing
soo just pull the freaking character it aint that deep bro plus endgame is not something you have to do its not mandatory
i have read this comment about a times now and its getting frustrating because nothing like that is gonna happen
kaelr are you sure about that
kaelr nobody can predict the future so it is true that we can not for sure say that something bad will happen but by the same token you can not say that it wont happen and unfortunately the very nature of gacha games almost always means that players will should assume that the publisher is not on their side and expect the worse possible outcome
kaelr then read it a thousand times then remember to go back to that comment when it inevitably happens lol
like closest thing is divine key in honkai impact which is among several gacha i played and everyone agrees its a pw system
examples for mainstream gacha games like that
idk man fgo and gbf never had global buffs despite being grindier and having harder content
that sounds like a really decent idea but we are talking about hoyo here so definitely not happening stacking global passives is the only way that you can beat the new release million hp boss
acherons techninque has more value than this shit xd
yeah i also think like that imagine having or active passive at the same time
the worst the passives got was like nahida blocking off the thought dialogue if you didnt have her
dont look chinese reaction to the passive you will smile
the point is that the precedent was and is never needed to begin with legit at any point they could make something give a dmg increase but only if you pull this thing anything is possible if you start playing the game of ifs after all
dawg i think you just described yan qing the undisputed title holder for the worst star in the game
i think the way they designed break it pretty much had to be done for the break damage dealers to work these also dont reduce the enemies resistance to the element but even then you could argue thats just bad game design and id be inclined to agree the ones i do find problematic are silver wolf acheron and feixiao silver wolf isnt a big problem now because of her kits inherent issues but acheron has no business dealing colourless toughness damage while also having res pen and the same can be said about feixiaos toughness damage and also what the hell is the point of anaxa being able to implant every single weakness to all enemies at once they dont even lose the resistances and its not a gimmic to enable an archetype im completely baffled
crashsparrow yup pretty much agree acheron reducing toughness through toughness protection status is probably the worst offender i disagree that it was necessary for break though without fire implant firefly wouldve been great dps for only fire enemies which was part of the original balancing reason for elements to begin with but they wanted to make her universally good and i say this criticism as someone with an e firefly lol
xanavii i disagree if firefly is only good for fire enemies that will limit her too much you might as well just pull a crit unit or any damage type
xanavii i dont think that firefly would be ok without colourless toughness break problem with break carries is that they dont do any dmg if the enemy isnt broken crit carry will deal less dmg but not by that much unless you are trying to kill an enemy with res against your carrys element
blueknight i think this limitation would be better for the game but hoyo just enabled this perspective after and because of acheron the lack of respect to their own type system is what makes firefly more appealing by having fire implant while also making balance worse hoyo is saying instead of pulling for a specific damage types just pull those characters who can do anything which makes elemental system obsolete and im not even talking about damage powercreep its a powercreep of systems
rules are made to be broken
weakness implant is ok
i guarantee that if firefly or boothill couldnt do weakness implant people would have been screaming about how hoyo was being vewwy vewwy mean and punishing players who didnt pull silver wolf i mean they did the same screaming when aglaea dropped and it turned out that really letting her off the chain more or less required sunday im not here to defend global passives but comparing it to the super break team design is a bit spurious
they break their own rules really first of all point me pls where it was written this rule nd try honkai impact rd that has global passives for a long time they change almost nothing
its only been two years i cant imagine how they will break the rules even more on the next anniversary
the game is going to be dead in the future though every game ends most people arent here trying to play future rail though they just want to enjoy the game now and most likely wont even be playing by the time it ends anyway
a hoyo game ever reaching eos is highly unlikely seeing how fgo has existed for a decade now
solardxgamer what i love about fgo is the fact that all rarity are being loved by the community and have their own dedicated fans be it one star two star and so on plus newer units doesnt always end up better which are good thing to me since im fp in that game but seeing hsr its pain since they keep pumping out stars while our last star is moze which came out a year ago
not to be rude but i dont think you realise the full effect this could have if this is successful which it most likely will be they will definitely keep pushing it towards global dmg crit spd buffs etc and then other gacha games will see its success and copy it me personally im sticking until the fate collab and if the global passives are starting tohave become a real problem i will drop hsr
yeah i dont have the energy to get as angry as everyone else there are other things to do in life that saps my energy and other games that entertain me
id be happy to lose this because i dont really care for the meta and would rather tackle endgame without relying on the socalled powercreeping or this new global passive
its just horse armor its just skins its just loot boxes its just battlepasses its just for c furina
it would actually suck balls if sticking a global passive on a hero is hoyos idea of making them more meta viablestronger i dont think it even should be in a tryhard grindy game like this at all no matter how strong or weak it is like they got the idea that they can do this and that in itself is scary because there is no telling what future characters will do i think that fear of what can be done is one of the main forces nothing could happen but the thought of something happening is not a pleasant one
i am personally not too bothered by this situation and you sum up my feelings quite well i play a game because i enjoy it and if enough internal or external factors change that perspective i move on the relative power of characters or the difficulty of the end game content have never been issues for me even before i could moc it was only jade i lost out on i get the feeling some people just care way too much about their relative performance in the game you arent really competing against anyone that said if this is what debacle is what makes you quit i dont blame you and fully support that decision
so funnily i think the controversy is a symptom of something else frustration at the general direction hsr is heading yknow at least with genshin theres the aurgument that its a game that caters to a casual audience but even it is experiencing a similar debate as even the casual elements are falling into typical gacha trappings hoyo games are just becoming more gacha aspects that they usual bunk are becoming more present yknow the benifits there adding for whales is just the black card or exclusives from other gacha buffs arent new to gacha but even the most significant buffs dont matter when powercreep out paces it i think the anger is that people have found themselves liking gacha games have an upfront fee in terms of time and money where gacha are burst of times spread out with the option to pay full games ask to hour upfront and to dollars if your somebody who enjoyed hsr whats the alternative and i mean in terms of polish so people are frustrated
if you have bad account single revive wont help if you have mid account its easy to sustain if you have good account you still cycle without her
always appreciate the curious neutral outlook you have as opposed to the highly negative views or toxic positivity we find too often also adorable castorice thumbnail
not in response to the video but the situation the issue i see is the fact that hoyo sets the precedent meaning every game will eventually do this making the gacha genre even more predatory which only hurts the players
wish that passive didnt become global there was so much hate yet hoyo did nothing
this problem is being taken so out of proportion people is talking like this pasive is goint to one shoot the bose that was killing your whole team already not just one character or like they werent going to pull ever again for a new character you can wait of one that you like the powercreep in the game is out of control but the problem is not here but in the ridiculous hp inflation we dont know if we are ever going to get another universal pasive anaxa doesnt have one but we know that hp keeps going up and that old units are getting buffed i dont know how things are going to end but there are far more relevant things to talk about that this
i absolutly do not care about any global passives or powercreep in hsr because in my eyes it is a game about lore and story with some gameplay attached to it for appearances i will play it as long as the story is good in games like genshin or zz such things would be inexcusable but it is a game you leave on auto for most of the playtime why would i care
ok here is my hoyo shill take healing is just worse than shielding and with hp scaling characters they can no longer use max hp boosts in healers kits to make them more similar to shields they know everyone will get castorice because she is a popular character that they have been pushing they give her a global passive allowing you to revive if you have a way to heal in order to counterbalance shielding being stronger now how much you heal matters more because youre healing all the way from but they couldve done this differently still and id rather they didnt do this
these comments just do not understand that this very likely could be a one time unique thingif hoyo really wanted global passives on just any character they wouldve done it in genshin atp but it wouldnt make sense lore wise so they havent im like sure this is one time thing that we wont see again unless its on another anniversry character which again theyd have make it fit the lore of the character and not just slap it on even if it doesnt work with the story
to be honest i dont think the whole playerbase would be outraged by this the real majority of the playerbase the real casuals who do not engage with the online community of hsr or any gacha in general will not care about this were in the smallest minority so i doubt the outrage for the global passive will amount to anything in the grand scheme of things but well see
shouldve been a normal passive for her current team only smh
wkwkkwkwkw
hmm
i was at a con recently many hsr cosplayer to love for the game despite castorice to even claras va being there
its funny how theyre even doing a topup event to make more bucks to push this global passive even more in hsr
izzme all hoyo games have always gotten st time top up resets for their anniversaries to incentivize spending so i doubt theyre resetting the top up in hsr specifically to push the global passive concept
i am rather certain hoyo wouldnt push global stat buffs as a mechanic in future kits the simple reason being hsr devs arent stupid enough to kill the balance of a game over a very very marginal amount of extra money in the short term you might think well hsr devs dont care about balance at all to which i would say if they really didnt care about fundamental game balance why would they ever restrict sundays skill to only nonharmony units if they really didnt care about game balance they wouldve forgone all restrictions and let the game run wild with infinite energy exploits and infinite turn loops if the devs really want to push global passives how come neither anaxa hyacine nor cipher have been leaked with any in their kit that would surely make more money right the cold hard truth is the reason why reddit and twitter have been parroting this global stat buff paranoia is because none of them are businessmen actuaries or game developers who know how to maximise profit they think global stat buffs will make hoyo more money but if anything they will lose money in the long run how would they lose money global passives incentivise and create fomo its exactly because it creates fomo that they will lose money imagine five units come out with no global passives and then one comes out after with a passive would anyone really spend money on any of those five units if they know that another higher value unit with a global passive would be coming probably not if people collectively feel this fomo and stop pulling for a few patches most fp would have enough pulls to es the new unit anyway so hoyo wouldnt even be able to suck the low spenders dry
i think it only happen for special character like phainon ipc high member emanator
you get stuff for spending money wow big shocker obviously they want you to spend a lot but to get the good stuff its like a single pack and it lasts until obviously not everyone can afford that but if they cant then why are they bothered by it its a gacha game you spend you get more thats how the game works is it predatory of course it is but its up to you to choose whether youre able to spend and if you spend while not being able to afford due to fomo that doesnt exist youre just dumb lol
they wont xd
and in all these cases you can make an argument on why they can be good addition to the game except horse armor and dollar furina that is just a scam and lack of self controll
ibrahim horse armour is just skins for your horses
pfft only c nah add a couple more hundreds you atleast need c lol
ok theres literally no way you dont get c furina before getting anywhere near dollars unless you are blowing it on standard banner for star glitter for the limited banner also ironically enough genshin is the only game where not spending money is allowed people really dont know how spoiled they are because genshin is babies first gacha where they dont realize how unprecedented it is for launch units to still be used and actually be meta cs furina is more than fine when every other game copying the genshin gacha almost always requires a copy and signature weapon to function on any meaningful level
i remember the days where players used to say characters felt complete at es or that eidolons werent that important since theyre weak global passives will for sure not follow the same trend right
the problem is you dont need any of these stop being an idiot
hoyoshill coping mechanism in a nutshell
the issue with this is you dont need any of these
its just a faker skin
stormvanguardbzow its a reference to a real life case
if you understand what means then youre just like me chronically online
what does the horse armour reference
kaizenx elder scrolls stuff horse armor is apparently one of the first ever known instances of microtransaction
stormvanguardbzow you know its referring to the new drama again right
saavlewdfanpage you know its referring to the new drama right
zehoovy kuroshill hating mechanism is about to explode
cinema
gentlemouse not really any logical person would see that and think its cost for something
if youhave brain you will watch video and listen to points he makes
mesacomplains fair i typed first then i watched
and a worse thing that comes out of it is that hoyo didnt listen meaning that they also probably wont in the future
leaks response to video they already are planning more that do change stats of characters this is and will be the precedent probably and will be a very dark space especially when so many of the wanted characters will have these passives meaning its known well that people wont vote with their wallets as a community showing that change wont come we can already see what will and is happening
therealestsparkle as far as ive seen there has not been any more passives stated to come in the future im not sure where youre getting this info
tyran phanion is apparently supposed to have crit related passive
therealestsparkle you dont have proof of this
solomoncounts my link got deleted just search hsr phanion global passive leak if you wanna see it
not to be disrespectful but this is why hoyo games will never listen to criticism or just improve in a meaningful way because the majority just dont care
amirmahdi yes and no i dont deny that it is about players voting with their wallets but on the other hand we have zz zzz devs try to listen to what players want and have made a lot of significant changes like removing tvs so its not like they dont want to listen because people will pay anyway and more like trying out the waters on what is the most effective strategies for their future projects are can they get away with powercreep how stingygenerous can they get with the currency etc so while even in this case player opinion probably metters for thier future peojects i dont think it will have a big impact on hsr obviously its just a lot of speculatuion without proves but at least it is how i see the stuation
now consider this have you ever played honkai star rail in your life in what world did you get the fact shields healing they both have their downsides
kinshields are much better than healing because you can survive shots more reliably
phainon is currently in testing also has a global passive for crit stats and another thing the teams for all games are like very different in both managerial position as well as like actual devs
there are already leaks saying phainon will have a global passive
megameister how do you know stop looking at leaks lmao its all fake
sora bwe knew the global passives was coming because of leaks
those are closed beta footage not leaks leaks are the ones that some random unc said on telegram
the thing is apparently cn players repeatedly voices their concerns about this since the first beta but they ignored them so yeah as i said in another comment casuals are the reasons why hoyo games will never live up to their potential and allow them to do whatever they want because i dont care i play for the story or i dont do endgame
amirmahdi cuz they arent free all day to grind the game and has an actual life
amirmahdi were those players actually beta testers or just following leaks cause if it was leaks then no shit they ignored them as would any company even the ones you would think least likely to
minecraftliker no no im pretty sure they were beta testers because i heard people share their experiences and i mean when beta starts the kit info gets out so yeah
amirmahdi so they werent cause actual beta testers are under nda and no the kit info is not public when the beta starts either
minecraftliker oh i didnt know that because i follow leaks i forgot how that works
hoyo shill not the end sure but its a start for something bad not only for hsr but for the gatcha games in general hoyo just set a precedent and other companies are gonna react accordingly
honestly you sum up my feelings on the matter really well it sucks but at this point in time we cant really do anything just be tentative with the whole idea of global passives and hope this doesnt turn out as bad as many expected and wont actually affect the enjoyment from the game for many people im still really excited for the next patch cause of all the changes coming in and i am pulling for anaxa im hesitant on castorice cause i love dragon and she has a cool dragon but thats kinda all i like about her other than her animations so idk if itd be worth pulling just for those two things when her kit and gameplay themselves dont really call to me
it sets a dangerous precedent
it can bloom into something worse but i think the same thought process can be applied to just nothing could happen its not enough for me to quit personally and i personally think generic stat ups will be practically useless with how bloated unfortunately harmonies are i dont think extra crit or atk or dmg will really matter much in the long run
i hope its toggleable
youre not supposed to make sense in this community man only complain about the devs every turn how will the drama agenda get farmed otherwise smh my head
rthis wont work on sustainless teams btw bc the characcer needs to be healed or shielded
if they want it to be lore accurate mechanic they could just make it inside amphoreus and in nonendgame but they have to do this bitter taste to our mouth the next passive is where i decide for keeping in the game or not
honestly its likely that its really not gonna work on endgame driven content its prob gonna be a sunormal mode novelty while staying completely out of any higher difficulty content by just disabling it there
tldr global passives are longterm effects that will enhance powercreep even more shorter text for those that dont want to read more this is testing the waters this is either them ignoring feedback for a mundane detail or deliberately trying out global passives global passives are a long term issue and will affect everyone who doesnt have every character the timeline of beta testing cas and anaxa to them adding global passive to one and buffing them while nerfing the more hyped one is another issue in itself vote with wallet is not effective because the community is literally playing a game about gambling for digital characters that will be worthless sooner or later powercreep still getting ignored for the majority while releasing global passives that will influence the decisions for endgame content suck most people who are criticizing it arent doing it because of the revive its the criticism of hoyo painstakingly testing the waters on global passive approval the issues at hand with powercreep not getting adressed in any way for most older units but instead introducing another thing that will be taken into consideration for new endgame fights and the worst part of it all is what will come next if the community isnt loud and clear about this we dont need nor want global passives in general but even moreso the ones that have stat manipulations like adding literal crit dmg like what apparently phainon gets tested on right now or similiar mechanics that is the isuse because this game already doesnt struggle with making characters indocue fomo upon us all this will make that fomo worse some people are also not happy about the blatant favoritism for cas in the upcoming patch character test leaks come out people are more hyped for anaxa buff cas people still want anaxa nerf anaxa people still want anaxa test global passives and nerf anaxa even more into the ground while buffing cas that entire timeline feels very scummy and that paired with the feeling of them ignoring powercreep while making a new mechanic which will guaranteed speed up the process is making people rightfully upset personally i will stop playing this game alltogehter once the characters actually release and cas having a global passive i dont want to support this predatory marketing either monetary wise which i did do in the past i am a shark level spender consistently or even number wise on their playercounts i find the discussions especially in the hoyolab very distgusting in how people try to defend the practices done them taking microsteps each patch pushing more fomo onto each character and each time people say but this isnt actually that bad while ignoring every criticism point points i disagree on yes they can buff the shit out of damage on enemies that will make a difference and that will happen either be it when the next shielding sustain comes into play or the near fututure thats literally testing the waters they will see how many people are already fine with having global passives that is literally testing the waters in every way possible and that is an issue no doubt people are not good at actual boycotts especially when it comes to the gaming scene i mean hell have you considered that gacha is literally gambling with no monetary return and instead characters that will become worse and worse every patch that is the issue with global passives this will never happen you will always be on the brink between this is kinda a must pull because of the passive vs ah its just a small thing it doesnt matter thats why the entire global passive thing is such an issue the players dont realize how much it will stack overtime and especially in years if they were to continue that way of releasing characters with the new mechanic more than twice a year global passives arent immediate issues they are becoming ones that will wreck the place very hard and yes the devs could just ruin the game at any moment and honestly the fact they got so much feedback against global passives is in no way enough but it for sure is an indicator that they are willing to either put the smallest detail above critcism of not just any part of the community but the literal beta playtesters or they are willing to introduce the mechanic despite the negative feedback
castorice opened a new era with her existence bringing innovation to the game
i wish it was passive not global passive
i dont like how the passive works when castorice isnt on the team it doesnt make sense funny enough the lore would show that castorice needs to be nearby you for her power to be effective against you since she is not on the team and the passive still works this also doesnt make lore sense lol
ngl but the passive makes me wanna pull her even more but i see the issue with having it work without her in the team
i really hope its just a one time way to fit with castorices lore and not the next big idea their trying to push
hello
without getting into any of the discussion about if its good or bad this is absolutely not the first gacha game to have global passives it isnt even the first hoyo game to have global passives
thats exactly what so many dont get ya this global passive is whatever but its not the ability that is bad its the idea in one of the biggest gachas doing it and many defending it
jadetarem its the first time a mainstream very popular gacha game from hoyo does that which will influence others in the scene as well
megameister genshin already had global passives to though those talent material refunds you get for having a character on your account were already big buffs that can save you hundred of resin every month at the very least this dont even include stuff like discounts on prices of weapon ascension for pulling raiden
jadetarem yes this isnt the first time a gacha game introduces a global passives mechanic the difference being that other gacha games make the global passives part of the base system so both fps and pws have equal standing grounds they dont lock the global passive behind a gacha character hird does have global passives as well in the form of divine keys which is still terrible but the main difference is that most of them have craftable alternatives released some time after the divine keys release hsr as we know so far is only releasing these global passives on limited characters the most egregious one being the fate collab characters because theyre only gonna be run once and probably will never be rerun ever again just like the eva collab in hird
except when they release characters that are crit buffing and thus giving you either highroll crit rolls each so you can build your characters easier or enhance them more
megameister stat buff global passives are like pissing in an ocean most accounts will get better relic quality over time especially with the custom resins the passive buff would need to be a complete new modifier since all the traditional stats like dmg crit stats and atk are oversaturated with our current harmony units if we start getting passive vulnerability defense ignoreshred res penthats when the worry should set in
megidolaon we are fearing about vul def ignoreshred res pen like global passive in the future we cant guarantee that they wont do these and we do have concern that they will do it because hoyoverse is a gacha game company and when something becomes a precedent they never let it go and keep milking it over and over again
bloom when two elements love eachother very much
it sure as hell is enough to make me quit fuck this game
yea cuz guide makers who get castorice are gonna be slightly skewed even moreso if future global passives have more proper buffs
seaberrysvideodump i genuinely think only anniversary units will have weak global passives if anyone gets it after castorice since her passive is technically useless without a healershielder and even with one if you dont have an ult that healsshields you are screwed since after that units extra turn after revive they are downed again your sustain wouldnt immediately have a turn if they werent drowned as well which most likely wouldnt happen since sustains are the tankiest of any team also wouldnt want cas revive to trigger first before revive in du cuz it actually can revive the whole team if they were all knocked out simultaneously while the blessing only revives one character so it must trigger first
lets hope so
youre not supposed to complain when the devs make a new way to be even more predatory that allows them to balance the game where you need a character you dont even want just for their global passive you shouldnt complain when the devs release a character with a passive stronger than castorices smh my head
swuolf try to comment on it when you understand the subject please youre afraid of the unknown and flailing just make it known instead so you dont have anything to worry about the video talks about this wait and see
chdd applying that kind of brave the unknown logic when you know that the company is infamously greedy they have a powercreep issue and its a gacha game is so ignorant of the situation going again to the metaphor you gave youre not going to see a hole thats completely dark and jump into it when you know its going to harm you but you can try to cover the hole and put a sign on it to prevent yourself and others from falling into it criticising the devs to try to stop them from going overboard is that signbarrier
its not brave the unknown its learn what youre talking about youre fighting ghosts a passive that you dont know if it will ever return or how it will be implemented if it does or what it will do stop schizoposting and learn whats in the dark hole youre looking at a puddle for the record
uh hate to break it to ya but it works everywhere
its gonna work but its still irrelevant to of the community if someone is dying in they have worse problems or its a oneoff thing like the video mentions and sustainless teams only get to survive a little longer because you still have to heal or shield to come back from deaths door completely overblown nonissue and anything that has to do with what it will bring in the future is straight up baseless doomposting this early in time
chdd gacha really rotted your brain when you consider it baseless that its from an already infamously greedy gacha company
i think it rotted yours because you have extreme paranoia over it i am fortunate enough to know how this works so it doesnt bother me in the slightest im skipping castorice as i have no use for her and its not a global passive that will make me pull any unit ever because im not at fomos mercy im actually of sound mind
chdd paranoia when its a notoriously greedy gacha company with power creep issues at the very least as long as people are angry over it they dont go overboard with global passives in the future
all the people that are angry in the entire world dont amount to anything youre so out of depth its insane they could all quit at once and nothing would change because it doesnt matter its an impossibly small portion of the playerbase then when nothing happens and youre proven wrong things change to phew that was close guys good thing we got together and said something online or it would have been real bad we saved it totally havent seen this a billion times over the years totally not baseless doomposting
chdd to clarify the doompost isnt that the game isnt going to survive its genuine concern that the experience is just going to get worse i wouldnt call the concern that the game experience can get worse baseless when it is an infamously greedy gacha company i also am going to skip castorice since i built my acct p well already and dont need her passive what do you mean by nothing happens as well that they dont release even stronger powercreeping global passives or that they genuinely dont listen to playerbase anyway i genuinely want to know your thought process about this
chdd i think youre intentionally trying not to understand the point theyre making at this point
concerns are not what youre doing its plain doomposting youre not concerned about the future but afraid it will go bad and arguing in that direction by default i dont know how you dont realize it reading things yourself they listen to the playerbase but they dont have to do everything theyre told thats not how feedback works its the portion of the playerbase that cares about this being minuscule the amount of people who even open the endgame screen is minimal from those the people who know this is a nonissue and the ones who pay too much to care outweight the ones complaining even if they were all gone nothing would change and i hope they keep their word and leave because worrying over nothing every patch will only make them unhappy on top of getting farmed by creators stoking drama its the same thing every time something new gets released since a scandal about superbreak a scandal about full team advance a scandal about mydeis auto no one learns its exhauusting
chdd the only part i agree with you is the middle paragraph tbf though personally i was not part of the superbreak scandal or mydei scandal since i genuinely think those are non issues hell i didnt even realise there was a scandal i ignore pretty much most drama in this community because i genuinely dont care about it though this is one issue that i find to be worth caring about were afraid because of our concern that the game is going to accelerate to a more predatory experience global passives means that even if you dont like a character you might want to pull for the buff itself it may not be an issue when it is minor buffs and at the start but becomes an issue when they keep releasing more and more characters with global passives and it stacks but yeah the options are to keep playing and hope they dont go overboard or just leave first
at least we have some common ground to drive the point home all the things i mentioned were overblown just like this but not in the same scale and none of them matter its all drama this one youre not concerned about the buff just the feature but every single character has a risk of you disliking them but wanting something from their kit how many people skipped jiaoqiu despite having acheron skipped tribbie because shes a kid model people even skip characters for being men global passives are no different anaxa is coming out and his kit doesnt have a global passive in it from what ive seen from others they dont either its specific characters only in fact it would be beneficial for the people who cant clear the game currently to get some help from outside their team because theres nowhere else they can get help from when they enter a stage but people would rather freak out about it by default simply because they dont know how to respond to new information its no secret that people are resistant to change but with minimum scrutiny its easy to tell what is worth worrying about and what isnt
chdd while i agree most people easily freak out over anything and are resistant to change that happens both against improvement and degeneration if people are resistant and it turns out its a change that would be bad its a moment where it makes sense to support while also reminding people to be more analytical first before reacting if they are resistant to something that would be beneficial is when you can call it out in force i used to have the same mindset as you so i understand where youre coming from with it your character kit examples are literally the characters kit where it requires you to have that character in the team not a passive that is global so its quite redundant in the situation regarding worth worrying people dont want the experience to get worse which is an understandable worry though the extent a smaller handful of people go overboard dunking in people who just pull castorice is annoying if its a game they actually like and with a company they know does not gaf abt them though it feels horrible it is sensible to just accept the situation and choose options such as leaving the game and see if the game experiencd becomes far worse play but not spend any more money in case the game experiencebecomes far worse and you lessen sunk cost or just dont gaf abt the games health anymore and have fun while it lasts
youtube is doing the thing where messages dont show up on the notification tab i sent it twice and cba to go sort everything by new to see if it posted properly hope they showed up there
i still believe that if a global passive comes out as broken the cn community will have a word and since hoyo only listen to them it wont happen but whatever a revive isnt that op especially considering that you need to heal the chars assap or they stay downed
rikuhh her revive isnt broken yes youre right but the issue is quite literally just one character ahead of us in development look at phainons beta testing leaks
leave to anaxa mains to be upset about oh they nerfed him its bias for castorice and say dumb shit but when tribbie got nerfed everyone online was like oh haha shes worse than robin om om om characters are nerfed things happen anaxa isnt even a bad unit but leave it non tcers to be slow n dumb
woahitsfranco yeah except trib is like literally the best support on the game rn with mr tied with robin anaxa on release will be subpar and only good on cas bis not even with that much advantage over other characters in said slot
im still not sure why nerfing a character people actually like would make more money for them
seaberrysvideodump worse character means you have more of an incentive to pull for the meta in the near future focus more on the other banner during the patchtime
tldr then proceeds to write a whole paragraph
also doesnt she have a teamwide res pen buff as well in her base kit thats already op for a dps and then they overload it with this passive oh and hyacine is gonna maker her even stronger
yo thanks for this comment it explains alot for me
stepperino its a fucking thesis
megameister whats phainons global passive
remember castorice was the most first hyped character even before released of amphoreus she got the most many fans than all chrysos heir cast so she is give a special status from maker
woahitsfranco they was male simper
genuine question since you seem to have come to the conclusion yourself partly why not just get used to it we cant change anything so its better to change our frame of thinking moc top floors is for whales its better to enjoy events have fun by changing from character to character to character every few months essentially have the mindset of a casual its much easier this way and youll be much happier instead of fearmongering or complaining about something you cant change
tldr words used to mean something
because this game is something enjoyable and i think that the global passives that are coming will make not just the entire endgame content overtime worsen but its just a clear sign that hsr managers dont care about the community and forsaken how they get their money this also has a deeper meaning to me because in the last decades consumers stopped boycotting especially for electronic purchases and this will be another big step either for or against the direction its going cco
this is not a tldr
vonfafa it is when instead of paragraphs i formulate it into one shorter one that takes less than s to read
cco weird my other message didnt send my issue is with people who are either delusional in the sense that hoyo cares about user experience more than their money making or even anywhere near equal its not just an issue with hoyo but with every game that i played mostly shooters where the studios slowly turn the game into worse and worse experiences just for the sake of ripping of consumers im sure youre familiar with what happened to cod every new release gets worse than the other and everytime people still cannot boycott the game and instead keep buying skins for whatever reasons this issue of people not being able to boycott games is a tragedy in my eyes and needs to be clear to everyone in our society be it from any country on any continent that has ever existed
i completely agree with your opinion on boycotting games people really arent capable of letting go of a few pngs to get better treatment later and in gacha games getting better treatment usually also means more resources to get characters so you really only need to send the message once and then wait for reruns im one of the people that really liked castorice both story and designwise but im absolutely not pulling for her i think were very few people but well at least try to send some kind of message and i hope more people will join and lets not even get started on the repercussions that not being able to even boycott a game has on real world events rn because holy shit do i despise people for some things
thats a horrible tldr
megameister imma need a specific source for that one bc i literally cannot find it at all
megameister you are just lying here there is no leaks on phainon getting one at all him being a male makes this because hoyo just straight up doesnt like husbandos and prefers waifus since they sell more if you got just send the link here
a passive is something like ruan meis spd buff or hertas crit buffs a global passive is when the character just has to be on the account to activate
the hsr team were definitely high when they thought up the global passive for castorice why make it global and not just in her team
paulyvii nah they even doubles down and its definitely not getting changed yes this is either the start of the games downfall or the playeebase will basically be cut in half those who want global passives and those who absolutely despise it like me
paulyvii maybe bcs she will become demigod kinda like emanator
paulyvii favoritsm pretty much
manoharalisa weve gotten three other playable demigodsand they have nothing like this
paulyvii maybe theyre planning on releasing a character that has the ability to give massive buffs to resurrected characters and worse if its once more global lol
i think its because shes technically the new death god of amphorius she just omnipresent in that way ig depending on how the story goes anyways but even then i feel like the passive should only work when youre in amphorius or on an amphorius stage
i was at a con recently many hsr cosplayer to love for the game despite castorice to even claras va being there
so in game she is actually stronger than in lore quite a rare sight
flamelance_accendo if this was really about lore than it should be literally impossible to die as long as blade is on your team
dannympdq that was properly illustrated with people having solo videos of him tbh
if youre speaking for when she gets her other half then maybe so as for it being limited to amphoreus idk about that i think to be fair it should be just limited to her being in your team and not out of it
she is the godness of death who should guide the fallen to their forever resting realm but her passive delay death we all know that is not delay
dnel she will ascended as demigod her status got higher later
dannympdq in lore she win againts blade only acheron can defeat castorice nihility emanator vs death demigod
thanh and she actually embrance life in lore she not want to bring death
manoharalisa later before may be she just a dead goddes of a dead planet right now
shes gonna take the coreflame of death so
if you die in endgame and did revive via castorice passive it still counts as death so its borderline useless in moc pf and as lol before you yap at least research having hate fomo will not heal your skill issues
manoharalisa blud forgot the part where an actual emanator prevents blade from dying whereas the gods of amphoreus arent actual cosmic gods maybe emanators at best
its still use full for pf and as since to get full star you just need to get a high score not like moc where you need to keep everyone alive drunkvader
its should be that she need to be in the other side of the stage what i mean is for example is pf yout first half is a himeko team and the second half is a castorice team well both of those teams can get revived but only on one of them if your himeko dies no revive for castorice teammate
do people suddenly not die just because castorice isnt near them use your head before you talk about some shit lore take
the passive making people wanting to pull her more is exactly the problem with global passives it would be a different thing if she had to be on the team
um leaks already show phainon has a global passive he has a day and night cycle to all modes in the game i dont remember what the day cycle buff was but night is a free crit rate
only
ghosty if it stays like that where the buff stays small then the global buffs arent that bad
callmefried is a lot
callmefried yeah its nit game breaking
welp i have bad news for you because it seems from leaks that the devs are planning to add more global passives the ones that are basically confirmed it seems are a speed boost and a flat atk boost the devs are clearly willing to exploit this predatory mechanic as much as possible so complaints need to be made as soon as possible so this doesnt become a standard
ghosty wait there is more global passive can you hint me another one
codyhax source
she kills people in her lore she doesnt fucking revive them
codyhax no other global passives have been leaked youre believing fake leaks
callmefried crit rate is in no means small its literalyl highroll critrate rolls for free forever global buffs are over time when they release characters over the next years and even just half of them have this calibre of passive skills you will feel it in your account and thus you will feel it if you dont have them and that means the devs will have to take that into consideration for the future you will have harder fights because of this
ghosty this just isnt true
tyran it is tho
callmefried crit rate without even being on party for entire team is not really small when its almost of a cr piece or roll on a single piece like people still use fuxuan for cr so they can run cd piece instead of cr piece so it actively reduces amount of grind needed for better gear and allow some units to run cd piece and that is assuming it doesnt stack with future passive
callmefried crit rate is still a crit substat that rolled times it is game changing for everyone that doesnt farm relics like its a job
callmefried isnt small by any means its basically crit rate substats its enough to free up space for other stats like crit dmg atk hp and be if thats stuck to a global passive players who have phainon will have an obvious advantage on building their characters theyll be able to give their characters an extra crit dmg and a atk more or less thats not small
ghosty where a theses leaks cause i havent seen anything
ghosty proof i made it up seriously leakers dont have access to leaks above patches and phainon aint coming anytime soon
if the leak is not on hsr leaks reddit its not reliable
i wont believe leaks ive been burned by that before and if they do start adding more global passives then ill definitely leave hsr wont be worth the hassle at that point
chrisfosterit they dont exist lol its just ppl trying to fear monger and doompost if these were real leaks they wouldve been posted in the leak subreddit
ghosty phainon was the mc on amphoreus so he surely gets too
callmefried only seems small but for every single character is massive now characters can give up some of the crit rate stat and pushing more into crit dmg or atk
ghosty there was absolutely no leak that suggested phainon having a global passive thats just lying
ghosty source trust me bro
princekili i know they be pissing me off
ghosty where are your sources ive been scouring twitter and reddit for leak bc i really want to know phainons full kit but i couldnt find them yet
ghosty who leaked it is it a reliable leaker or just a phantylia
i dont get it cant you just play through the story and leave it at that whether you spend money or not is completely your choice even if the game tries to push you into it story will never require premium units or signature light cones
all gacha games are gona have something people dont like wait for wuthering waves to come out with something im gona laugh my ass off power creep is in every game ive ever played good luck all just play the game you like i mean we all want better for the games we play but that takes a movement in the community and it has to hit hard i mean you are only gonna get so many wins and these companies arent just gonna give away ther best stuff it isnt just hoyo its all games by the way ive played alot of games and i kno exactly where people are coming from its like when a game first come out its good cause thers no power creep and then as time goes by thers hp inflation and characters coming out that can handle that which leaves the old ones in the dust its in all games thers always a better character coming out
good i left this game the moment started cuz it felt mid for me p and powercreep was tiring as hell few patches ago player do perfectly endgame with some characters and then it seem my best units dont have dmg at all well there is a way to have units fresh longer like get e star event unit and its all work somehow my friend got kafka e on her first banner and when i still played in last patches of x she still did not that badly but well for fp getting e is just too hard work only if u skip few patches p and now i see global passives dont have a question if dialogue walls without skips werent bad enought p a little late comment cuz wasnt rly interested in game for quite a bit time but saw this material as it showed up on my recommended nice material bro
this video aged like old milk where is the flood of global passives in hsr hsr failed so hard it made k million dollars they made that on the castorice banner on mobile alone eos soon this video and many like it sound like a salty break up letter to their ex
castorice didnt break the game acheron did
banner and characters kit leaked after castorice released still no other characters with global passivewhere are the global passive that everyone was crying for
took you people long enough to open your eyes to see hoyos greed i realized this the moment genshin launches with that shtty rate and long ass intro unskippable story before you can pull the st gacha punishing the rerollers at that moment i decided not to invest any time in hoyo games and i guess i made a right decision
yall playing gacha games just play aa game and its better like rdr cyberpunk ghost tushima
i believe wuthering waves will kill honkai star rail or at least force them to listen and change to a more friendly approach all thanks to wuwa it already happened to genshin
the fall of honkai star rail meanwhile hsr just made over million from the castorice banner lol and now the fate collab is fully revealed and saberarchers drip got over k likes on jpn twitter
its really a shame this game was good people loved it now look at where it has come still not gonna drop it though
even tho i dont play star rail anymore its a real shame to see it dying the character designs the animations the story everything were top notch if only it wasnt a turn based game not to mention the powercreep tho
w this is player friendly
enjoy ur fking wuwas money xd nigsfacebluesmiling characters banners xdd
i just dont care about castorice at all im skipping her and pulling for anaxa instead
its far from death and the old character buffs look great
if in the future all new heros get a global it doesnt matter its just another passive
i mean just like implanting your own weakness its something that just completely fucks the weakness system silver wolf did it but it was what made her special then firefly who had a sad backstory fan favorite and cool mech animations basically hsrs new poster girl for a while and then weakness went downhill with characters like boothill and fugue castorice is just firefly all over again sad story cool animations fan favorite new poster girl and rule breaking mechanic
how do people believe this nonsense some of the players do this every hoyoverse game when ever their mad about something in the game
""
which is why i avoid these kind of ccs everytime their take about hoyo is false
acevortux but money suddenly good quality if wuwa switches place with hsr and earns more than m am i right
acevortux i feel like many people get dismissive of mihoyo games success tbh i think hoyo games are mid but they are popular for a reason and a lot of people enjoy them
acevortux you are missunderstangin something here people leave hoyoverse game for wuwa not because they dont listen to feedback but because of free stuffs wuwa have been giving tons of free stuffs for players than hoyoverse while that is a good idea to get players attention it also backfired in wuwa st anniversary on wuwa st anniversary players was upset about the free stuff they wanted more since they already received those as normal free stuffs the problem escalated so fast that cc who loved wuwa started to make drama videos about wuwa their discord was flooded of rages and even the game rating was going down in some stores thats what happens when you spoiled too much a kid now imagine what will happen if nd anniversary wont have more free stuff than st anniversary wuwa is not as good quality game as some people think because lots of free stuff game has good quality lots of free stuff how many people want to be spoiled pd im not saying wuwa combat and exploration is not better its good but kuro is spoiling too much their players with too many free stuffs
w mika pfp
acevortux lol i can also say those revenue in wuwa is also how much money that kuro has exploited from players or saying all the income that any games made exploits the money of players thats a dented take its simple ppl like castorice then ppl spend on her plus that with the amount of players in hsr has
ok im going to be one of those guys for the record i just started playing but its a gotcha so isnt this kinda thing expected and isnt this a single player game as long as you can keep beating end game content why is a global passive such a big deal also i pulled her and the passive has never been a make it or break it thing so far
i will wait for ethira restart in june cuz the pulls is way generous not like this hoyo greedy dev
bro i know that global passive is really bad but why are people ignoring other problems like the horrible dog shit yapfest storyshity boss designshit endgame the global passive alone didnt ruin the game the game was already bad
it went from genshin could never to genshin is better wild
tbh i have castorice and the only times her passive activated was in her team so that goes to show it should have just been exclusive to her team alone
castorice global passive breaks the entire community dead game me beating hoolay to death with a halfassed e lingsha say what
so for anyone that is looking for an alternative for hsr i would recommend looking into etheria restart its an hsr style turn based gacha it also has an equalized pvp mode just wanted to let anyone who wants to fight back but loves hsr gameplay know
i find it funny that hes talking about broken trust when the devs are known to not be trustworthly glad i never touched that game hoyo is a company selling casino create a problem sell the solution its the motto of that company genshin hsr zz everytime spineless coward ppl doing cowardly stuff no surprise here sadly the majority of streamers cant control themselves and need to spendpull for characters gambling at its worse because it normalize it
idk why u even played hsr in the first place lol it literally doesnt have a combat its a heartstone wannabe and all ccs for it are morons
frankly my love for this game dissipated after belobog anyways the game was never good after the initial release and im thankful i uninstalled halfway through v as i too enjoy spending my free time on games that are headed upwards not lorerich exposition dumps that suck my pockets for everything they possibly can
arknight mentioned yippie
dawg every gacha is like this lmao it all becomes stupid they can also just make the enemy unkillable too if they wanted
i dont care since i already have like top tiers when am i supposed to die at this point
shit its now on play store
i truly truly hope that kuro games will never go down the same route as hoyoverse to me theyre like the light at the end of the tunnel the final bastion of good will honor and respect if they ever veer off the dark end i will no longer trust or play any gacha games ever again never again would i be emotionally manipulated to pull for characters never again would i feel fomo never again would i fall for the same trap that ive already fallen for times already because of all the sweet sweet empty promises they make
try arknights its a shit game too but if you use reading skills and have strategical thinking in tactical map you good
wuwashills on their way to post their eigth video this month dissing on honkaigenshin
i was one of the last people that knew of her kit i planned on pulling for castorice because her design so i dont really care about the passive her damage is crazy and she has a pet dragon im having fun playing her
i got castorice with pull and quit it was my last one still i was like lmao naah
like what
they got backlash when pgr came to global and that made them understand that west people like the game to be fp
that aged not exactly the best at the end of the day no company corporation or game is your friend no company is a final bastion or light at the end of the tunnel they just want one thing and thats whatevers sat in your bank account
youre just an idiot hutao simp hoyo games will become whale only if people like you will keep defending this shit
personally these practices have made me view hoyo as hyperpredatory but i did attempt to consider a possible solution that could work specifically in hsr they could update older characters with worthwhile global passives they could give gepard either a plus hp or a damage reduction or the the first time a character on your team would take lethal they gain a onetime invulnerabilityshield so they dont need reviving but unless the game applies this or a towerpassive system as suggested by tectone i dont think ill be playing hsr anytime soon
i wont get my hopes up but it would be a nice thing to see if things can make a turnaround for hsr because it was really great and i remember when the community was unanimously enjoying everything about it its sad to see how divided the community is right now
i have been a hsr player since version i have been off and on a low spender but after all this shit in the anniversary patch foreword i will be going fp i pulled castorice with saved up pulls i did not spend money because i enjoy her character aside from the global passive i am still somewhat invested in the story so that is why i wont outright quit the game yet at least but i started wuwa weeks ago today for zani and i will be a low spender in wuwa instead i am enjoying wuwa despite being mediocre at action games
entire community more like western ones bro its called gacha for a fcking reason theres a limit in playing fp in gacha games bro
only kuro can save us i hope that theyll make turn based game like hsr
genshin im uninstalling it cuz mualani is white hsr
man
cant wait to see revenue result lets see how dead the game really is or is just some cry drama youtube gremlins who care about meta in pve rpg game with my free account i can still beat everything and i dont care shit of cycle or stuff like that
star rail turned me off the moment they brutally killed off the beautiful vixen tingyun right in our faces
this is the best passive we need more passives
thank god we are getting free ruan mei because even if she gets a rerun she is easy at top most pulled units so they dont even get much from her rerun anyway xd this passive beside concept is actaully not that big but if you have more than iq you know it will get worse soon hsr have so much problems that its insane anniversary has the same amount of pulls as previous patch gearing characters is disgusting we have events per version and nothing to do story telling is terrible white text on black screens dialogues are bloated af buffs to older character are coming in months nice job multibilion dollar company new characters kits are locked behind lc way more than before when people said that acheron needs her lc when she could use gnsw s was funny now look at mydei casto or hyacine that is coming next patch i actually think that passive is a cherry on top of the cake but the cake is made of sht xd
the entire community being few toxic lil shits from en ccs community ok bro funny joke kekw
guess why pgr and wuwa never fall cuz its never rise
so many
sure sure sure in a month itll be like nothing ever happened maybe even less its not like this hasnt happened multiple times already people will keep playing people will keep paying that wont change no matter what you say or think keep this comment in mind for the next hoyo drama maybe then youll think for yourself instead of just going with the flow
here is the deal you either get castorice global buff and you enjoy it or all enemies in the game get hp buff
a chinese player pulled copies of castorice to get reroll dice for gear so he has a good builtthis game cannot and will not be saved
the fact that they made her so broken in hopes of players just being like f it but still kept her global passive is disgusting theyre just like yeah you should pull this super powerful character and haha you just gave in to our decision p because they literally made it so you dont have to do a single thing to reap the benefits of her passive theyre literally saying yeah just spend money getting her we dont give a sht what you do with her tho its just awful
can you make the rise and fall of the game
doing my part gamewise im hoyoless starting from hsr best decision ever
m
more that devs listen and for pgr its peak right now many free units and dmc collab
sky pgr is ok its fun but guess what wuwa will become what genshin look like right now after or year
takuto it wont the first anv has like rewards like free limited star and limited weapon selector this is kuro and they know if there players are happy they will spend in the game kuro makes more money from skin in pgr then character as you can get every units plus that we got blue banner reset next patch with a banner that gose up to nanami that will stay for a long time also we are getting a free s ranks back to back
sky that only the first aniv i dont have any problem with pgr but do you remember the globle release of pgr its was a mess they are greedy as hell back then they learn form that bro if they get more money like hoyo did they will maybe change who knowshoyo used to be great the first any of genshin is great but what are they now everything change
takuto they are getting money that true but the devs learned that if the player base is happy the game will stay alive and people will play it just hoyo has not faced that same thing once they do they might also do that but it might be to late for them
changes community voice what do you mean hoyo never heard hoyo never cared so you cant push back you cant do anything
well i can totaly understand the people that fear that more global passivs come to the game i wouldnt be so happy about it either but if i look at how weak the revive from castorice is it could be that the upcoming global passivs first sound as big as the one from castorice but are just as weak in reality or hoyo just makes it a time thing and just wanted to make a unique gimmic to their new star waifu i dont say i find the letter likely i just think of what can happen
aged really well kurogame just silently censoring wuwa
i wouldve like for you to highlight how hoyoverse made every attempt at silencing the community when they tried to pick up this topic whenever players tried to voice their concern about global passives they got cenzored and their voices snuffed out posted on reddit moved to an unused megathreadbanned you for your toxicity sparked a topic on discord banned commented on any youtube video on hsr channel comment deleted they hired people to silence thoose who had concern they banned freedom of speech that is just too far gone but even then players still have their two most powerful weapons in their arsenal dont spend dont play cheers for reading i didnt spend a dime on that accursed patch
how to kill a game make it a pay win game
dragon unleashed jumpscare
a global passive that allows you to skip cutscenes would be insane
game is not gonna die castorice will revive it
man
ill be blunt i never really liked gacha smack he always came off as somewhat pretentious and rather uninformed about various topics regarding hsr but i digress it is really disappointing to see all of this drama unfold i am a day one player and pretty much viewed hsr as my true to form favorite gacha but it seems that you really cant trust a gacha company shouldnt be surprising but still this game gave a lot of great memories and amazing characters to love castorice is also a character i care for but its a shame that shes the face of all this turmoil either way while im not ready to just straight up quit hsr i at least want to see how bad the game will get in regards to these global passives until then itll be just passive log ins for stuff and not much engagement as i shift into fp almost all gacha fall into the trappings of power creep eventually but it seems that hoyo sort of missed the forest for the trees when it came to this recent chapter ironically for once it seems that hoyo somehow dropped the ball in hsr more than genshin i can only pray that zz doesnt suffer from this down the line but only time will tell
amazing
im not talking about the game anymore because i refuse to give momentum to this im playing girls frontline now and occasionally watch youtubers who didnt pull for that damned girl
pgr and wuwa could never
yea hsr wont fall because of a toxic players lol you all think you have so much power here when you have none at all
the moment the passive came the game was too far gone good day to any one still playing
why are they complaining they are playing hoyo gamesthey expect gonna be treated with respect dump faks
i had to disinstall for months and i had no idea about all this i came back because i was curious about amphoreous and rtb and i wanted castorice yes i was a bit shocked about her passive when i found out but as a day zero player of hsr i never spent a dollar and im still here because i enjoy the story and the general aesthetic of the game
its not that big of an issue tbh the powercreeps are available in most of the gacha games so i dont find it that bothering to me
lol boycott failed and goodbye to the garbage content creators
game started going to shit since and nothing changed nothing will change regardless how people complain
if everybody knows it is not silently
because it was good at one point in time this take is so stupid its just like saying you move to chicago you shouldnt be upset that you got mugged and shot last night it comes with the territory like yeah the association is there but that doesnt fucking make it right and when star rail does this bullshit it sets a precedent for other companies to be even more anticonsumer and predatory dont be a hoyo shill or a corporate dick sucker
you should at least try to explain the whole skill otherwise its just stupid clickbait
why even create drama over a frikin global passive yes it can potentially lead to future characters having global passive which may pressure players to swipe if they do not have enough pulls but isnt that what happens everytime characters powercreep other characters and its just a natural part of the cycle furthermore this global passive is unlocked at e you literally only have to pull copy its not like youre going for e hsr also gives enough funds for players to pull a character every patch not to mention this patch is an anniversary patch so this might even be a time thing who knows just a theory im putting out there but the point is how bad can single copy of a character hurt your wallet and lets be real here hsr is a fckn turn based game theres only so much mechanic you can introduce to a turn based game before it starts to become boring yall should be greatful that they do stuff like this to make things interesting because if not then yall would complain that the game is too boring or too repetitive
this is just some naive person talking the minute you you started paying genshin impact years ago you know you are on a pay to win ship its all about money same for every company you think they make game or product for free if you dont like it stop playing simple or make video that arouse poeple hate and get more stream and views before quiting end of story
i liked how the game once felt like you could built any team but as when a mmo became pay to win i leave
it sounds like a virus hacking your game data
hsr could never
i just roll castorice and is just very good character v dont understand why people hate it that much
the hoyocucks just never learns
i hope this wont aged like a fine wine but back in the day genshin rots while hsr thrives now hsr rots while zz thrives i hope this is not a domino effect because if this is a pattern zz is next while they release a new game
im the only one among my friends who seems to care about the global passive and how bad a precedent this will set for insane powercreep and hp inflationarmor stack enemy mechanics
its not even pvp skill issues keep crying lol
seriously if cipher didnt exist i would have deleted this game its so dead right jow
when i entered the game the first thing that i see is nothing but castorice and an invitation to pull no man i know this type of games are predatory in essence is their business model but let me go in to the game before you start to shove the cash grab down my throat not going to uninstall but i will not spend more money on it i want to finish the current story and then we will see where all is and what i will do then i will throw my pulls to anaxa because i like the guy but it would be so funny if i dont get it like being kicked while already on the floor
lol he already back to honkai star rail
bro pokke video when
more like viewers fall off
imagine looking toward box for consistency and principles might as well build a bridge out of wet toilet paper v
its unfortunate that gachasmac is the exception regarding showing selfcontrol and selfrespect when youre disrespected or blatantly ignored if that behavior of walking away from such a luxury as a game was standard companies wouldnt be faqing over their audiences nearly as frequently especially when they have time to course correct with feedback before implementing such a divisive thing
there is just a lack of things to do in game there are only about events each patch now
i quit playing this game ill just wait for kuro to make a turn based game like hsr
it is not about the e or the money it is the fomo that it would give players think if every character would get global passive like this from now on how many eo you would need to collect every single timepeople are not afraid of castorise people are afraid of the future of this game because literally they crossed a line which even hoyoshills cant defend now thank god i invested in genshin instead of hsr at least genshin does not have this problem if genshin does this i will quit the game then and there
one reason more to pull her got her and her lc today and i had very much much fun
ngl i havent played hsr since the end of belibog so i have no horse in this race and after watching so many hsr ccs cave or do a on castorice i now hope her banner breaks records simply because itll be a clear signal to hoyo to open the flood gates on global passives and i want to see just how insane the devs will get with them like in mos will there be half a dozen a dozen maybe even more global passives in the game and just how broken will future gps be imo in a vacuum castorices gp isnt that game breaking but what about one that gives every team cr or speed and if hoyo does go that far with powerful gps will content be balanced around those gps to the point where if you dont have most of the characters with gps will even midlevel content will be a struggle maybe if this was done by another company one that had a good track record when it comes to balancing monetization and fomo with being fp friendly and providing an overall good experience for all players id have more faith that gps wont get out of hand but this is hoyo who has pretty much the worst track record out of any of the bigger gacha companies my only fear is that if the gps are highly successful then other devs will borrow the idea but i tend to be way more picky about the gacha devs who games i play and the gachas i currently play all have devs who have proven they want to make video games first and keep the monetization reasonable so that theu make more than enough money but they also dont feel the need to squeeze their playerbases for every dime also i feel hoyo know that their core player base are mostly children with undeveloped fromtal lobes or lobotomized adults so they can do the most predatory things in their games and their players will still eat up all the slop hoyo tosses their way
i played hsr october of and the only reason i still play is im waiting for the game to keep me hooked like belobog did and im getting impatient devs got lazy
we hope that the square will realize sooner of what he did hoping he will move on
the fall of hsr the fall of genshin the fall of zz meanwhile each game consistently has over m players and revenue still top on the revenue reports next year why hoyo games are still alive and high revenue and playercounts mean nothing the cope is real among hoyo haters lol
gacha gamers are addicts gambling addicts to be precise and hoyo knows it would you have faith in a gambler when he says he will quit they cant even if they want to they need rehabilitation to be frank gacha gamers gambling addicts are pushover and true whales are bigger pushover and they are the main money source for gacha game slot machine to be frank gacha game slot machine has to be ban permanently i expect that this gacha gamer gambling addicts to resort to crime in the real world wait they already did and i also i expect the extremity of the crime level to increase gambling addicts so as gacha gamers the more they gamble the more they morale degrade so expect the worst i dont know why guys r surprised
no amount of look everyone we made another special waifu is going to save this game no amount of attention backstory and video promotion or animation they put into castorice would make the rating sympathize with her damn
hoyoverse is in a whole sht hole rn and i think we all saw this coming
but someone still plays hsr today
the banner also made top in pretty all the asia regions lol
the amounts of doomposting and pessimism i have seen across all hsr platforms in the past month has been ridiculously fing stupid and endless like its just one character like her roll dont like her skip i personally skipped her for jiaoqiu although i might try getting her but da passive werent you guys complaining about hp inflation earlier and ridiculous boss dps heres your current solution casotrica bbut da future implications lmao its not that serious you can still perfectly play and enjoy the game without castorice or future passive characters every game evolves throughout the years that units years ago looks barely recognizable its only a natural cycle were slowly evolving of course theyre gonna add stuff instead of the usual stuff anyhow stop being pessimistic crybabies and enjoy the game edit i wish i could stop seeing people saying they deleted the game or will quit or do vidsposts about wanting to quit like no one cares lil bro
entertaining drama i got bored of tectone lately
time to wait for kuro to make a hsr type game its only a matter of time
this is so sad man legit the gacha community to my knowledge is the only space that actively cant unite on a common goal helldivers and even league of legends were able to unite and protest against things they didnt like it sucks seeing people fighting over some moral high ground that doesnt really matter instead of uniting and fighting against blatant corporate greed
well hsr is a gacha game with a terrible company which is very much known now you just gotta let it go because they dont seem to be stopping at any point and why even play bad games when there are different genres with over millions of games that you might like all you have to do is try it like how you tried hsr and fell in love with it ill be sharing my favorite games with yall if youre interested and want to take a break from gacha genre god of war series ghost of sparta chains of olympus ascension and ragnarok ghost of tsushima assassins creed brotherhood revelations black flag origins the elder scrolls skyrim watch dogs legion sleeping dogs kingdom come deliverance kingdom hearts i fucking loved because of insane combat mechanics batman arkham knight and finally witcher happy gaming folks
sadly its not the fall of starrail the game is going to continue and people will still play it if castorice makes you unhappy just quit the game because complaining to mihoyo wont do anything they dont give a shit as long as there are shills they will continue forth
the fact that the game now starts with a full screen ad for the new unit and has a top up event tells you all you need to know about the global passive
glaive will you try black beacon
they didnt broke shit the so called castorice stupid name i dont want to be castrated is still getting pulled by tons of people hopefully its over for honkai so they work on zz
castorices passive effect isnt that god damn bad i wish people would stop complaining
people still buy ea games so whats your point lmao
the anti hoyo cc and people love to deny statistics and tell you to focus on their opinions instead
weakestbaenjoyer its a pathetic sight i dont play hsr anymore but some of these cc are so obnoxious and obsessive
and a white screen with black text just to piss you off
lmao what is this supposed to do at least theyre doing something to promote the character instead of just putting it there you bunch cant be grateful in any shape or form
prayherta dude didnt watch the castorice ads
prayherta doing something to promote the character oh you mean they are so desperate to sell the character they shove her right on your face when you open the game sure promote indeed
why put it in the game if its so insignificant think about it
rlstrength he said its not bad do you have the attention span and comprehension skills of a goldfish lmao
its like blud didnt even watch the video
sorry but what is cc mentioned in image
i deleted the game after the livestream
all i play now for gacha is limbus company and wuwa i dropped everything else especially mihoyo im playing my backlog of single player games i collected its time to play those and stop wasting my time on game basically will eventually die because company runs it is ruining it
still hate myself not dropping this turd in glad i bailed in dog shit writing terrible powercreep i had enough plus combat was getting stale they didnt bother adding extra button or mechanics to make combat more interesting
im scared with amounts of copium people consume with this game my friend told that power creep is not that bad because she still use follow up fox lady and she is still good but her banner was less than months ago and then i wisited prydwen and the herta already lost a whole tier thats pretty much insane
did pull castorice and lc hope will get untill end of banner e
one of the things i hate the most about this is that castorices global passive isnt even as crazy as i thought in gameplayif revivals were that good more people would use bailu but the fact that they even entertained the idea means that they will likely do it again in future probably not anytime soon but it will happen again
okay boys time to make black beacon famous so the next hoyo games have a pity banners
well you really cant tell people to not love the game you know what players could do is by playing a different game and make it popular beating hsr
im still having fun playing hsr
hoyo will keep this up even zz isnt safe
hahaha i saw today castorice is a top sales in cn so guess what hoyo doesnt give a fck about those people who whining about the global passive and they are going to do it again and again because people still spending money
i respect gacha smack for quitting its a great undertaking for a cc to drop one of the biggest gacha
wow fall of hsr but no on cn and jp ios too much drama farm
deserved for playing hsr tbh good luck letting the company decide what you pull on now
i got some free gems and golden tickets yesterday never really played this game so i just spent them right away on the cute elf lady got her so i looked up some builds apparently in the story she kills everything she touches ironic that this character is the one to kill her game
hmm i can imagine in the future that dodge parry mechanics will be global passive exclusive or atleast enablers o it was a good run
more interested in whats happening with march th than the world currently on
not that bad tbh
genshin could never genshin should never
content creators
no one cares really
genshin be like not affecting by power creep and doesnt have global passive who destroy the game the only problem with genshin right now is va drama but only for en
yeah no genshin also sucks lets not just forget these facts
genshin had fans begging for power creep complaining about how lord bennet and other launch stars still dominate the game
possessedbyphoenix lol no lmao they didnt begging for power creep they just ask for another support like bennet so they can have powerful support like him that they can use for both abyss stage like how people can use yelan and xingqiu who have similar gameplay
wekang we did get a second bennet
sky you mean iansan nah shes not good enough actually with how little she heal is and she required a character to moving a lot so i would not consider she a another bennet
wekang same but she dose give the scroll set buff
amirabdullahshafin genshin could never really just became better due to hsr powercreep anyway genshin only has years left so if makes sense that hoyo will not put that much love in that game anymore after which if there is no new game after zz then hoyo might make hsr more fp or zz so they could stay in the global market hell if the free limited selector and weapon selector in wuwa st anv is true then it over for hoyo as they will need to do that to keep the player base or get reviewed boom and even cn players might see this being good and start to leave
wekang genshin went downhill imo story ruined the game for me completely and why the hell do they release a random cow instead of capitano i will never understand
midnightblue lol capitano still alive why they release varesa because varesa already in planned they already leak it long time ago in live stream genshin is not went downhill actually because gacha game on decline this year thats one of the reason why you thought genshin went downhill because your favorite character is not playable but thats only your personal opinion and we talk about power creep right now genshin still can balance it after years thats impressive actually compare to hsr that only years but the power creep keep getting worse
mass quitting more like theyll be making m this patch
all these problems wont exist if the age rating of all gacha gamea is m so no one can blame anyone tbh playing gacha game is basically gambling like no one blame casinos for being predatory
unninstaled both genshin and hsr while ago im just sad that both of these games keep damaging zz too because its from same company
this age like a milk after her banner drop and making big ol revenue
hsr dead start after because you know how was gayshit impact same cycle dispointing players just shills who was happy with that one the first day of ik this is gonna happen and i was right here were i deleted game and sold my account before the anniversary best choice but hsr was my fav hoyo game
for me if the gacha game no longer fun despite after spending money into it first stop do any purchase whatsoever and go fp no more bp no more welkin or similar stuff nd try to use whatever character you have to do what can in the game see if it still doable on how far the end game content is rd if the game is no longer fun and feel chore to you in which you keep asking yourself i can play other game much better than this stop play and uninstall that game already and go play the game you been thinking about i do this on clash of clan clash royale raid shadow legend and few other gacha game which i already spent money in the game by completely leave it be enough is enough from all this game i play and learn after all this time each company will do this kind of move which is making player the need to purchase something in the game to go through game content easier and faster its just when and how while what happen to hsr is sad but for me its to be expected it was good while it last
wait till zz fall like hsr since its a hoyo game
this definitely aint the death of star rail lmao i wouldnt be shocked if this is the highest sales theyve had the store was even lagging last night lmao ccs severley overestimate hour much movement they have lol gachasmack is not a big voice in the hsr space no one cared he uninstalled cause he didnt play the game the mass uninstalls were again people who already barely played the reality of the situation is that nobody actually gives a shit lol these ccs never said i wont support this practice they just pointed out thst its bad which is telling their audience to be wary and dont do it if you dont want to but that doesnt mean they cant they didnt rally troops they just said yeah this sucks
those review bombed hsr still play and spend money there aint no point in this shit anymore
i dont really get it i just have one thing to say people who spend money on the game will continue to do so and those who dont will not i am an fp and as for the predatory practise then shouldnt all eidolons be considered that as well as they incentivise people to spend money on the game its just a game play it if you enjoy it or dont these are gacha games and this is nothing new gacha games are and have been like this from their inception
in my eyes gacha games should just disappear for good
i personally dont see the problem with castorice the revive isnt at full hp so its pretty easy to die lol
hsr has broken my heart i was hooked since launch and truly felt something special in the game i enjoyed it so much and for the record did not whale i was a light spender i stopped playing at the end of penacony because i grew bored and burned out i thought i would return when came around im so glad i didnt so i didnt have to see the slaughter of this game in person what i see and hear about this game now is genuinely depressing and it only get worse with time i thought it was already dead when hearing about the new dpssupports and then castorice happened what a waste of incredible potential im genuinely very sad
i still play but now only as a side game paying only battle pass and monthly pass was paying as a bigger dolphin wanna experience how it actually feels to not being able to clear moc eventually even as i play daily
i quit hsr but i know the game wont lose popularity players or money the devs could do anything like you can use a character unless you have them es and people still will play and love it
the fact that they added the value packs shit is so sad
the thing is hsr is a turn base game its not a hack and slash game where you can mald yourself until bald to clear the hard stage
at this point hoyoverse will become ea of gacha games
its hoyover
in ph
you dont see how a strategy rpg built around having a team gets worse when the team is affected by units not in the team
rlstrength no i dont its a gacha bro strategy also includes managaing resources and pulling worthwhile characters also its not like the game is unplayable without the revive
ramandeepsinghmlkg you dont see the problem what is stopping them from putting crit passive buffs in the future and the endgame will definitely be balanced around that and then it will be unplayable for the older units
ive played many gachas and have seen these concern multiple times but it has not stopped any gacha nor have any of such games become unplayable and let me reiterate planning your resourcesjades is part of the game also why has no one raised these concerns when half of the units kit are locked behind their eidolons this is just my thought process on this matter if you dont agree then thats fine i am not here to dispute but just here to share my perspective
ramandeepsinghmlkg i understand your perspective bro i think its fine but you need to accept that pay win is a gradient the game is unequivocally becoming more paywin by introducing this since there is now stricly more spectrum to invest in before you were limited to full es team with perfect relics now the ceiling will keep growing with passives agreed right now its only slightly higher because who cares about the revive but the way forward is there they broke the the team is what is in combat rule youre right eidolons were already paywin but there is even more paywin now some people dont want the game to become even more paywin its as simple as that i dont think we disagree its just a displacement on the gradient if hoyo doubles the price for top up by your logic it doesnt change anything because it was already paywin but it would change the investment equation ok maybe bad example because it would only affect spenders but i hope you get the point
ramandeepsinghmlkg eidolons only make that specific character stronger like any other gacha games out there its pretty much normal so nobody bats an eye meanwhile global passive make your whole account stronger just by having the character which means youd be a fool for not doing whatever you can to get that if youre planning to play this game for a long time now this is hoyo so surely they will implement new combat mechanics around said global passive which will make the gameplay experience worse for those who dont have castorice not to the point of unplayable but worse nonetheless thats the issue and they wont stop at one
even qiqi does this but if she is in the team is castorise in the team
if you are still paying for battle pass and monthly pass you are still supporting the game i would only consider you are against the game now if you become fp
ea is like another level of greed
and then you also get the but its still making more money than your game or you dont even play the game
honestly how i felt just yea seeing the shilling for casto and anaxa is just baggage and lack of events feels yea i want to cope for silvercunny buff but at this point no copium or hopium ill play the rest of the patch and if it just the same as and then yea just gotta accept and move on zz is my last hoyo game thats hanging on already quit jenshin years ago and now hsr
i quit because of the spend money event and whale shop while fp little spenders get almost no events one ruan mei dupe and more pulls for anniversary
you pull for castorpo greed i pull for zani we are not the same
yeah i couldnt even enjoy my foxian team of feixiao fugue tingyun and yukong for minutesfeels like i pulled them for nothing thankfully i still have my kitsunes in azur lane to pick me up
i believe until there is no true competitor for hsr like wuwa for genshin the current state of hsr never changes
what people have to understand that its not just hoyobad but all gacha companies are bad yes even the new golden child kuro too do not trust them they are not your friend or small team of devs these are corporations using predatory means to get as much money as possible all good will is just a calculated facade to make sheeps believe they are the good guys hoyo just became so big that they dont need to fake it anymore and any other company will do the same the moment they will get in big leagues
wasnt castorice really good i have seen her dragon has good animation and gameplay
getting waterboarded with several new ways to spend money when logging after months of subpar storytelling and powercreep left me feeling insulted
the only starrail to me is on pgr nanami im coming for you
its not really the fall of the game its just a bunch of cc glazers who are making a big broohaha over nothing castorices global passive doesnt make the game easier or harder its just an extra perk the drama is just content farm
this wouldnt be a problem if they approached the global passive mechanic differently instead of releasing it as a new character i dont hate the concept just the execution
then the hoyo knights will keep defending this by mentioning free ruan mei or loucha or you can choose character to lose to brother man year from now million will be the norms for damage healers now give dmg shred by existing and support will give res pen think
all i wanna say is well gonna give it to hoyo for being a piece of sht that stir community into shtshow and bringing out the shtiest part of human being onto the surface no one doing it like hoyo i give them that
hsr health and balancing of the game has been horrible since acheron and only getting worse since then doesnt matter if the global passive is broken and game breaking bc in a few patches they will power crept it and inflate enemy hp even more so it doesnt matter most noncasual player know this and if they didnt quit months ago this wont make them and casual players dont know it exists or dont know the implications only the loud minority on twitter and tiktok are saying theyre gonna quit bc of her passive and who knows how many are serious how many will eventually come back away hsr will be just fine
this is the first time i heard you calm and not crashing out like crazy
for me its just i definitely frowned upon them more tho i somewhat stopped playing because i could careless about amphoreus since i just dont really care about god this and god that was good tho i love more human story it gave me hope for amphoreus but rn i just dont vibe with it at all on top of hsrhoyo definitely knew that ricegirl is the perfect seedbed because theyre predominantly also firemoth fanbase and the waifu of amphoreus thus if theres backlash there are waves of people that will defend them blindly or willingly perhaps both side exaggerating but nobody knows until few months or another year of hsr the implication of future global passive just demotivated me more from playing from just gonna play on weekends do the all the jade grinds to not at all rn im kinda disappointed too since my best girl herta just got upgrade into herself which i love her simple yet effective design e her i didnt pull since and nuke almost every endgame content easily right now im not in a hurry to do the story or maybe i already departed i still support and happy for those that still play this game and may they enjoy it till then
when old gacha players were shting on and dups system in gi new guys called us entitled and this plague is in every new gacha now with each new wave other problem was sweep under rug how you thought that this time will be much different
no more clowns youtubers in game is beater for everyone
new enemy skill when a teammate is revived atk
gachas are just legalized gambling after all
and it supposed to be anniv patch and some of the event is pay able to enjoy
castorice being the god of death brought the death of the game is a funny irony lmao
mc says rules are meant to be broken so devs says our game our rules they gonna push this further and it will become norm and just a silent chirps from the past in the near distant future
i watch this guys videos then watch them again on saintontas
idfc i love castorice
castorice broke tectones balls
i feel the drama is too exaggerated because people are mad because of future global passives when we dont even know if there will be another global passive character you shouldnt be mad at something that has yet to happen there is zero confirmation of future global passives like speed or crit damage or anything castorice global passive is balanced because people wouldnt even need it normally if your team is dying then your team isnt working anyways castorice passive tend to be only active regularly in her own team in other teams characters with aventurine or lingsha you wouldnt die anyways the drama will die down in a few months if hoyo just never releases another global passive and even if they do they would do things like stats boost outside party because it would break the game and wouldnt fit the lore
were going to buff old characters but were also going to increase powercreep even more with global passives improve the story wait patches in fact its better to wait patches well definitely improve it
i never gonna play any hoyo games after what i pass through genshin sorry those devs deserve the worst
im even receiving threats saying costa rica could revive me if i dont stop playing
cant wait for the fall of zz video next year the inevitable hoyo cycle wont be beaten
i need more games that are skill and strat based not numbers and percentages gacha games are literally just glorified gambling i regret the twenty dollars i spent on hsr because i coulda bought something better with that money like food lmao
its a simple tell really pushback this sort of bs so that current and future gacha games dont get reeled into doing the same predatory idea as much as the dumb part of the community that thinks hoyo started everything yeah hoyo innovated the bs hoyo innovated global passives imagine them introducing a char so powerful that because of lore he could break the th wall and for shats and giggles hoyo decides to add a feature into their kit that they could give you a skip button but the char is paywalled imagine that also with all the lore crap they give castorice shes death right so lore accurate we shouldnt be needing a revive anyways right we can just slap her in and since lore and all she can just kill everything right why do we need a revive if she could just kill everything hell i think even a chance of instant kill on anything sounds better than a global revive if by chance an upcoming game implements this paywalled global passive the gacha gaming community will only look at game that started all this bs its just a matter of time before they dip their fingers on zz
only dumb people still religiously give hoyo their money
just like you said its about whats come next im glad that i quit hsr early just like when i did with genshin before everything turn to shit xd
the only thing you can do to punish a gacha company is quit the game if you cant quit its you who have a problem and you are the reason they can get away with bs like that
gacha itself is already a really bad ganre i dont really care i see what i like i pull i see what i dont like i dont pull i like cas i pull
zz player this is your game future its an inescapable fact that all hoyo games gonna be pw
if this makes people quit the game thats great
bgm name pls
it did quite the opposite
cultureaddct no it quite did kill the game since only whales could even get her many rolled failed and quit game only really has whales left like hoyo wanted
darksolaris and by many you mean the few hundred people you saw on reddit and twitter cause thats definitely an accurate representation of s of millions of people
jeez dude why so pessimistic if you wanna play just play why do peoples opinions even matter to you
darksolaris thats an awful lot of projection you got there youre a pessimistic downer trying to make a mountain out of a molehill
darksolaris wuwa has fractions of the playerbase hsr has wdy
darksolaris not true i spent no money and pulled her
i spend to occasionally for the pass or month summon currency subscription
and thats maybe every or months on the pass
or times a year
darksolaris and probably they will use that money to improve zz more and then player switch to zz and they will make new game and repeat the process just like in genshin
darksolaris i got her
kerryfoxxo thats the hoyo way
fallen_oasis and what did it you cost you
there is already leaks of characters with global passives tho
vani its not confirmed tho you cant just go off by leaks sometimes
fallensnowch yeah we all wanted global passives to not go live and here we are
your reasoning about how the passive isnt even useful on teams with sustains like aventurine is so out of place the point of the argument is that she revives teammates wether or not shes in the team and that is game breaking enough lorewise or not
tamaki_akira its not gamebreaking lol with proper sustain and healers you often wont even need to trigger the global passive the reason why people are mad isnt because castorices passive is broken but is instead mad because of the probability that there will be more future global passives that grants things like crit damage or speed stats
fallensnowch am kinda fine with only castorice only having that passive as long as shes the first and last to have global passive
doomposters
thats a good take i say as long as youre fp pull for what you like as even if they know you pulled they wont make it much of a factor since youre not spending money
richkero im fp
the start of the downfall of hsr
of course people would fall for it hoyo put that passive on a character thats fan favorite broken as hell with a tragic story with visuals and attack animations weve never seen before in this game it was the perfect plan to implement global passives
i seriously hope this game dies
if the theory about amphoreus is already destroyed and its just a simulation thing true then castorice is a walking corpse that can revive people
just got castorice ill get her lc next ill pull whos i like play however i want and stop playing when it stop being fun no one opinion matters
everyone complained about powercreep and then they got account buffs by way of global passives be careful what you wish for with hoyo
mr pooks stupid tantrum completely veered the train off course
to think hoyo used to be mihoyo with the line tech otakus save the world and its bloody ironic that its kuro games who got that mantle or in other word they already had it in them
next year the death of zz
meh still playing anyway
as someone who considered this to be my favourite game at some piont the moment i saw castorices kit leaks i uninstalled the game i am so done playing a game where the developers dont give a dime about its players and just wants money
crazy thing is i pulled her and now regret it i could have improved my top acheron if i got jq
open the game and get greet with a nd anniversary predatory cash grab i kid you not they are literally put the banner in your face and get you to the whale events
man im so sad i still remember when the game came out was so excited i also whaled a bit but now man idk i quit the game and went to wuwa they at least care about their players
i uninstalled after the maintenance went up for i dont which to be privy to watching the game degrade further i stuck around for way too long to see if the game would get better no more
is today the anniversary patch whys the community so dry
nah its the same they did with the universal stat sticks weapons in hi so ye itll keep going till people cant afford the content
i think the game is in a fine state though theyre heading in the right direction hoyo fans are getting exactly what they deserve pretty entertaining watching the community in shambles trying to defend their multi billion dollar company and their consumer friendly practices
it doesnt matter pokke probably
dumpster rail o
well do you suggest that ppl should not pull for her even if they dont care about gp and just want to have her for her fun gameplay
bruh when i opened the game after updating they made a special intro for her so you could directly go pull for her insane
and on top of all that they direct you straight to rolling on her banner like one of those scummy gachas which is distasteful imho
vergil no because personally i didnt like how she was attempted to be shoved down the throat i dont like when a character is marketed in that manner
more like corporate greed ruin the world as mihoyo
now theyre just hypocrites
only wuwa survive
only if zz devs should go independent from hoyo because hoyos greed are out of control
nah next year is gonna be the death of genshin and star rail and year after that and again etc ccs need to earn their money farming fake drama
please dont speak this into existence
and in reality none of them are dead
idk man zz still standing even after that yao incident also just a cool game imo might wanna reinstall it
content creators farm drama about death of genshinhsr but as of the most recent revenue statistics both games are making about x zzs revenue
hope not i really like the game
yeah i hate ita deliberate act of begging by hoyo
how do i say thisthe event is spending event and the new stuff they add is for whales only so pull ruan meiluocha i guess nothing big like funny stuff or something
hendracs yeah i saw the patch theres like anniversary events and thats it the only thing worth noting is castorice with her gp issue and spending event i even saw some players who show their disdain about the spending event and got bullied out by the community for being poor lmao
lets be real the braindead hoyoshill will not let castorice fail we live in this shitty timeline for a reason and that reason is because most people are too dumb to realize theyre doing against their own good both for long term and short term on so many things on life see you in a few years when ip cash grab gacha going to follow this shitty practice global passive locked by paywall and then after a few more years newer gacha players think that it is normal similar situation can be observed on older gacha player with their signature back in my time theres no pity in gacha yada yada coping
bro they cant even give free pulls in mail they are giving events to get that pulls even tho its there nd anniversary
i will come back to this video after hsr absolutely dominates the sales and makes million in
you told me that no need to make video about this lol beating the dead horse still glad you eventually make it anyway
the beast has been released and im here for it
tectone staff of homa all over again
honey glaivekiyo posted a new video time to wake up wokege
i need to stop watching ccs its just drama and telling you what to think
double down and give it to the next game
where are the d animations in the background from are they in game cut scenes
arise arice i think hoyo should create a necromancer s character
i already give up on hoyoverse stop spending to their game and uninstall when others game like anantaark knigt enfield release now i just support whatever tf hoyo paywin practice so they can milk their players more
most hoyo ccs deep inside fck this game its starting to become more predatroy trash hoyo ccs sees their monthly bills well i love trash trash pays my bills so theyll drag their community into loving trash along with them lmao
only reason some including myself and some of my friends are still playing hsr is bcz of the fate collab after we get emiya artoria or berserker we uninstalling the game shi got boring after like
it was not the global passives it was that the passive came before the old characters buff the passive came before the skip button the passive came before the story improvement the passive came before hp inflation fix the passive came with spending events they dont give a fk they simply want the money from the players they dont want to make the game good they want to milk money from the players
leave the game to the fools who are fine being taken advantaged of years or months later when their precious game becomes unplayable let it be known that when the signs were there they ignored it then remind them they have no right to complain rather than try to save their game they chose to sit back and watch it die
i was having so much fun in the siege alter event arknights and i was never expected for this to be the main talk of twt used to play hsr like a while and got bored and probably wont now
imo their down fall started with changing their company name from mihoyo to hoyoversethis name sucks fight me the first game from them that i played is honkai impact rd im a year player has just recently quit at the new year kiana patchseriously i should quit it when part hit the game has insane powercreep problem but fplight spendermonthly player can still manage endgame well abyss at agonyrl without much issuei sometime got to nirvana and manage to stay there for weeks everything changed when part hits tho the game become something that i and a lot of year player just cant recognize that this is honkai rd the story is extremely boring at the first patchyou know well how shit their writting is after that i dont know i dont trust the people who managed to make me fall asleep while trying to read the story they cooked up that the story will get good after whatever i read through at first the powercreep is what sealed the deal tho you need to pull for every new characters since every single one of them is meta they are both dps and support at the same time and they are stupidly strong too thus hp bloatedfor comparison an ss boss at ma in part is around millions hp a newestat least when i quit ss boss is like millions hp this jump is in just one year oh they lower the pity for character banner and the weapon banner are guarante how amazin as if now you have to pull for every character and their sig every patch becuz of team buildingdude this one is insane i wont explain it here since it stupidly long and somewhat complicated a fp player can get like k xtals per patch and you need k to guaranteed a patch so f you mihoyo genshin quit long ago the first time i quit it is before the st anniversary but has already played for months or so too boring and took to much time to do anything i returned to the game before raiden shogun came out played to the end of kokomi banner then i quit the game for good hsr yo this one is insane the hype i have for this game i nuts at the time where i still love honkai rd this came out i have always love strategy game you see and this is an extension of honkai rd lore sign me in after it came out and played it my disappointment cant be describe by word the game turnbased system is fine but like mihoyo games it has hp bloated problem and shit the story oh boii aside from welt that originally came from honkai rd there is no honkai what so ever in the story so why even put honkai in the name of the game anymore and the writting is shit like always so after months i quit the game i never even touched zz so dont have anything to say aside that this game will follow the path that lead to downfall just like every other games of their the lesson i learned is that to never touch their game again and im glad that i quit all of them
ill say it again you finished puzzles riddles easter egg and what you get yes rewards chest but rewards is ridiculous purple and blue tier relics wtf is that for no one use those anymore in endgame i still found it in amphoreus wtf
global passive in hsr are truly ruin the game like imagine you dont like spesific character cuz their kits are mostly trash or the design are not your cup of tea but kinda forced to pull them cuz they have really good global passive and losing that will brick your account damn
true if they improved their game no one would care
the buffs are coming they announced it just read lil bro no need for skip button story needs some improvement yes but its already going good and decent despite the flaws hp inflation needs huge revamp yes but just git gud for the time being of course they want money theyre a business company not a charity yes there are flaws theyll eventually fix them but theyre not that serious as you guys doompost just relax and enjoy the game lmao
prayherta they announced the buffs can u tell me what they are as u know they were announced in and its already patches and all yeah my fault for not being able to read a hours of dogshit story that the devs admitted was bad also my bad nikkador oneshots me should have used my crystal ball to foresee the future and pulled better also i have no issue paying for a good game but i have issue when devs are simply motivated by greed and not passion
manishrana they already said they are gonna release them just wait while im not saying the story is particularly top notch or flawless i dont remember when did they admit it was bad nikador one shots your team the passive got added so you can face him use it wisely
prayherta ok so i am finally be able to use my argenti and dhil also they said the story was bad in the radio when they talked about black screen white text also i quit the game gg continue to have fun without me friends my journey was till here only
prayherta just read lil bro no need for skip button warcraft ii a decade old rts game which arguably contributed to wows development subsequently any mmo for that matter to its absolute peak has a skip button it is a very heavy storycentric game same concept of key characters and npcs interacting yet still they provide that option hsr and genshin have no excuse other than the skip button covering up what abysmal content they have or keeping player retention rates up
prayherta just git gud current moc is way too hard for the wrong reasons all this to promote therta i had to cheese the f out of it to beat it with my acheron team
typowykubini dude pretty sures a guy on yt beat it with only stars all you gotta do is learn the boss mechanics
frogking okay so ppl just assume everyone is a tryhard these days then why bother pulling meta if you can be musashi and solo most of the content with trailblazer
prayherta dont try defending hsr its a losing battle and this is just my friendly advice its in a horrible place currently and thats facts pure and simple
the problem is if we dont do anything this will happen in every other game then it will be the norm and gacha games will become unplayable without spending over dollars on the next new character
i know thats the catch here isnt it the possibility of other gachas adopting that disgusting practice the sad reality is that you cant save people who dont want to be saved logic pattern recognition sheer common sense doesnt work all we can do is wash our hands of these games and let the fallout do its job hoyo doesnt understand that that global passive is going to make it impossible for new players to come to the game after castorices banner passes they will have effectively locked their game from receiving new blood this is a death sentence and its started the clock on the end of hsr with no new players hoyo is going to be left trying to cater to their current players sadly time takes everyone and more people will start dropping the game revenue will decrease and because of the global passives basically locking the game hsr will die a slow and painful death the fact these shills dont understand this goes to show how limited their capacity to think is
this will never happen all of this only affects poor people
zanzecus i think it will be the opposite actually i think they will make a massive amount off of the banner and upcoming banners but your right though their game wont be able to grow because of this and word spreads around faster than one might think overall its not just hsr anymore its hoyoverse as a whole that is going downhill
kyromaniac yeah i just dont think thats true at all lmao
cultureaddct what in particular
lil bro thinks hes in an edit
prayherta huh
kyromaniac i wasnt talking to you lil bro
solariusaureum ok
perhaps its for the best that all gachas become unplayable so we all collectively just stop playing gachas completely
jlawrencium that would suck tbh
jlawrencium messed up thing is i cant disagree gacha is just dlc youre gambling with i even understand the fear these fans of gacha are going through for all intents and purposes if the devs shut down the game then the game can no longer be played in gacha you dont own the game you are renting space to play it and if the devs suddenly want to end it you can forget playing it again now maybe someone will make the game playable but no more updates means what you get is the final product its bad and its essentially gamers not owning their games
""
im going to pull for her for free and if i dont get her im simply uninstalling it ill just play wuwa tfd and ngs
i truly dont care im having fun anyways
honestly the ccs are the ones that cant pick a side
it just hurts because now i know how the community will act if zz falls on its face with something extremely concerning the exact same way they did with hsr ill cut my losses and play other great games that have nothing to do with hoyoverse
ive stop playing hsr cuz i dont have the luxury of waiting mins talking dialog with no skip got me irritated so i quit the game the game is good the story idk they put to much nonsense yapping which we dont rlly needed its like you have to watch the whole story with no skip whatsoever
just let the game die stop caring and stop spending the only way for hoyo to listen is to stop spending money and not show lnterest its just that simple the sooner you expect that all the time you spent on the game was pointless and you play other games the sooner you will not care about hoyo games anymore
shit show i lost and theres only fucking pulls hsr is from where im at lets make it lower this game doesnt deserve us and i ahve to wait fucking days man this is is so ass who tf plays this game anymoreaa
no la verdad no
if the cn guys is okay with it then its all good
man what happened with hsr between and and people are saying that zz cant be ruined like this yeah sure
goal million hsr revenue by end of april
nah hoyo wont die look at genshin now just play the game thats is fun
i bet if wuwa did smt like this nothing would happen cus its not that bad youre just mad cause wuwa ended genshin meanwhile i left the genshin community a long time ago and honestly i learned from my mistake when i said acheron would be bad for the game the game hasnt changed that much at all and this global passives for other chars what if what if is all from unreliable sources and most importantly hyacine a character rumored to have a global passive has been leaked and doesnt have one maybe next anniversary something like this will happen again because meta slaves never learn
i bet castorice banner will be hsrs most successful banner or atleast top
box i admit i am hypocrite for pulling castorice even though i said i dislike the idea of global passive respect pokke hes taken it upon himself to hold back other ccs that want to talk shit and start drama with me causing him a lot of shit in the background and nothing of which im aware of while im thankful hes trying to divert these ccs from coming at me i dont see why it matters to any of us since we both know all these ccs are irrelevant their existence is meaningless to me let them chase their latest drama slop with my name none of them will come close to the influence that ive shared with tec since before i even quit my full time job if they want to farm some views because they need it im all for it heck they are already farming this as we speak because tec stopped holding them back yes this is referring to people like saintontas no i dont give a fuck about bro even if he made vids about me hope hes happy with the ad rev i will never engage there has been a lot of collateral damage on both parts and im glad that he acknowledged his actions have inadvertently caused me issues as do i the c arle is a poor example and i apologise i shouldve used c cantarella instead even though the point is exactly the same no one should be morally held for pulling a gacha unit you arent a hypocrite you are a player he believes in pro consumerism and the customer is always right but i dont he caters to anti hoyo i cater to people that happens to play hoyo games in this case hsr its just the way it is while i can see the differences in ideology doesnt make him my enemy most people on the internet wont see that especially people that have their own agendas to push viewers and ccs alike compared to being called a rapist or pedophile being called a hypocrite pales in comparison but it doesnt make it any less bad because those are his views of me and i would never have those views of him i still hold my ground against the people that have these moral compasses in a gacha game but its unfortunate that its against tec as well i mean this on my soul when i was rewatching the clips off stream during my time at austin and sdo with tec like meeting the first time going to gym hugging for the zz relic roll i got emotional not because we cant talk about each other anymore in order to appease both our communities and the ideological differences not because tec was one of my first and closest cc friend and i vibed w him hard but its because i know something like this will never happen again the next time if it ever happens his chat or my chat is probably gonna go kms ew dookie or kms ew dicktone as much as id love to hang out again we will never see the vibes being recreated unless our communities make a change there wont be a gacha war at least not between myself and tec its just a sad conclusion to a story one that no one couldve prevented as ourselves and our communities both stand for different things the best part instigators and drama ccs looking to farm this will spin the narrative into some even bigger bullshit to push their agendas and go ultra farm mode i know we wont interact on content anymore but this isnt content this is the end of an era from my pov tec you were never my enemy i never hated you as a person and never will and i wouldve moved to austin for a few months after i settled my house but this is the best ending for everyone in the space because most people online arent mature and cc farmers want to farm
while mihoyo has becoles far more confident in their predatory practices they still make some of the most beautiful handsome and cutest characters which is the only reason i play their for still
once a hoyo game always a hoyo game
saintontas should react to this then his comment section will once again ask for the oiled up changli cosplay
yeah this hurts taking a break of the game may quit fully because we hate all of this honestly this was our first gacha game and hate to see go down this path
thing is if they had introduced global passives much earlier and instead of character having a passive everybody would things would be okay for the most part i just woke up so the sentencing possibly looks weird
dont put every cc under the same box they are all individuals who main goals are vastly different from the others
if zz was pay to play game that will be no gacha system at all
how about trying a different genre of game i could recommendsleeping dogs or watch dogs i never played either of them but ive been hearing that they are great games that age like fine wine
i definitely need to play sleeping dogs and watch dogs i remember playing a bit of watch dogs some years ago i should finish it up
ilikebeans both are also aa games that you only need to pay once outside of possible dlcs so you can say they have better value than gachas or any other live service games for that matter
and put with a lot of negative reviews to increase hoyogreeds pressure
probably aint gonna happen considering amount of whales and hoyoshills this game has
goodstuff not just a whale poseidon i saw someone pulls for limited lc for no reason time
flariousnut whatever you say friend
i bet if wuwa yeah hypothetical youre so cooked trying to justify the blatant disregard hoyo has for its playerbase in a whole that youd come up with imaginary scenarios just to support your delusional beliefs wuwa ended genshin when lol wuwa is just doing better than before due to improvements thats it genshin or any other hoyoverse games wont die cause they have players like you to milk from
acheron didnt change the game much brother they gave her universal break on her ult and it immediately led to firefly boothill and now anaxa rendering the elemental system useless for dpses lol not even mentioning how it warped the power level of dpses going forward this is an insane level of delusion
lsmsm bro she was worse than jingliu by far for a couple patches until jiaoqiu came out
im fp they make no money off me so like
arivrsal i bet if wuwa yes they would actually whimpering waste have been criticised to death people complained about character kits and there are alot of criticism vids if you go searching for it
based kirby
its been a problem since their hird days lmao
well hexjuice is retiring i think so someone has to oil up
you know those predatory turnbased cheap cash grabs that boost power level for every character and copy you pull for yeah thats the kind of future players fear of due to her passive
is not only the powercreep it self is also taking you the freedom of choice why i would pull for a character that doesnt have a global passive
why do you sound femboyish n this one kiyo
its not the fall of anything except the herd mentality of hoyo haters in general the game is just fine you guys just dont like the game and thats fine but the game is nowhere near the worst thing in gacha all this dumb drama did is get all the weird gacha tourist to leave and cause trouble in another gacha inevitably when they remind you that gacha in general are all predatory and scummy i mean you guys are rly defending another anime casino and playing morality over another gacha is low on the self awareness scale just play the game you like and if you dont then move on its a vidya game not real world politics no need to be all liberal about this this whole thing is so dumb because you guys think you have any real power or for some reason think ccs and their audiences represent the entire playerbase when most ppl dont give any actual shit about the passive because the only ppl that care are those that are sweaty in the game who are either alrdy satisfied with endgame as they are still able to clear it just fine or find enjoyment in other subjective things in the game besides endgame like the devs themselves have the data and know way more than all of you most of you ccs arent even sweaty in the game yourselves let alone play it but somehow care this much about the of the playerbase the game is insanely casual so im extremely curious to why ppl are this butthurt but you can trust the en side to find reason to not only dislike something but create outrage over the most trivial of things like im shocked ppl have played games like fgo gbf or any gacha pre genshin times and think this is the worst thing ever im shocked ppl can look at previous hoyo games with global passives like hi that have been alive for over years with global passives and thing otherwise you guys are weird and playing right into this artificial outrage ccs unnecessarily create for content
dont forget there is an incoming spending event to turbosink this game into full pw just like its predecessor truly a genshin could never moment
hoyoverse drama arc genshin arc main characters tectone mtash sub boss envi final boss ratsu hsr arc main characters tectone saintontas sub and final boss mr pokke
you guys need to understand hoyo really needs this money
hoyo started to filter hsr players once they filtered everyone who disagree like in genshin they will have another loyal army they aim to trap those whales who spent thousand dollars lmao
i dont know the law and stuff but they cant removechange her global passive anymore because that would be a nerf since shes already released so if they want to appease the players they should stop releasing characters with global passive
lets wait until next gacha revenue i think a lot of people are gonna be pissed idk if they are gonna be hsr fans or haters but theyre gonna be pissed
guys where is the push back against hovo this is not good its the time to show them global passives as a game design is bad but now month later everyone just joking about it help save the game
lets be honestthe hoyoshills are gonna eat this up either way like its a star disha dish with undercooked part
people think hsr will die but nah it wont
hsr is deadd hhahaahhahaha
mihoyo listening to global player pff hahaha xd wait you serious hahahahaha ok let me tell one thing about mihoyo they look at us the global player as second class citizen they say we listen but dont give crap about you global player and those hsr content creator they say big words like i quit mihoyo game or i uninstall because this thing next day the make another video play the game they quit uninstall hsr content creator are a joke they word that come out from there mouth mean jack shit
i used to love hoyoverse games cuz of the quality they bring and their generousity when i was still playing hird but after some point hi has started to ramp up their predatory and so i switch to main genshin and genshin kept being such a petty game that time hsr got released so i jumped to hsr at first they were generous and people were praising this one ceoi forgot his name for being the generous dev that handle hsr but now i dont even feel like playing hoyoverse games anymore its like falling into the same loop all over again with no end
day one player the first warning signs were after blade and how anti climactic the story was and dhil i quit at that very moment
oh noif you think castorice passive is bad wait there is coming down the line
how did hsr die faster than genshin
hsr releases a makes genshin looks like a subpar product zz season releases and makes hsr look like a subpar product releases and makes zz looks like a subpar product
biggest truth in this comment section by far
as a genshin and hsr player for me genshin is mostly stagnant they dont change same style same releases they bring new mechanics for new region but they are temporary like fontain mechanics which are already useless now while in hsr there is elements team type of attack and many more each was getting powercrept after months as a day player by i realise something fishy with hsr and uninstalled it if genshin follows same formula like global passives paid events etc yep ill quit that too the most predatory practice they did till now was muavika and citlali banner at same time and the free pulls in nd half i didnt like it
mtn genshin is basically stagnant garbage that never changes itself in a meaningful way
dude legit their are hsr players that already spreading the word filter the player base thanks to the global passive and i shit you not they even wanted more global passives in the future coz they believe it will surely filter more players and the only people who are going to remain are the ones that truly likes hsr these people literally screaming da wei milk me more like holy shit
mtn i agree w the citlali banner thing that was awful
mtn but we do have a global passive if you remember but thats for mora
mtn one of the most predatory garbage that genshin had released a double banner with mavuika and citlali with free pulls being after their banners genshjn has no hope
good expmle that honkaird bunny event for en look how they fvck up en player
genshin didnt have this level of powercreep
jaredjosephsongheng fair enough
at this point we can probably assume hoyo wants the community to keep fighting on purpose they want the drama to keep going and help them stay relevant to the market
the downfall of hsrs player reception has got to be studied
waiting for a comprehensive takedown of the new atsu o
older units become unusable in hsr they really forced me to pulls character that i dont like to clear end game content glad i quit that game
did it fall to stars last time its stars when i checked today
ive been a huge fan of hsr since the very first beta testsaccepted as one of the galaxy testers and was there for every single beta test i was a day player since the game came out logging in just hours after the launch i have many many battle passes and monthlies paid for logged in every single day for almost years straight didnt miss a single day i have almost every limited character sig lc in the game and i seriously loved the game ever since the castorice beta was being leaked i have not pressed the launch button in weeks they crossed a line that i refuse to follow really sucks since i really liked her design personality too
cant wait for zz season powercreep level remember this my prediction is inevitable
player you suppose be chosen one to destroy hoyoverse not join them cc that not my problem
was about to download hsr before this vid
nah to me its the stupid story bloat black screens and stupid same character model after years its damn boring
glaivekiyo hoyo aswhole is in big trouble on multiple raining of problems for them first million dollars fine second they fire mass of their own employees the ccs are all quitting their games including sevyplays besides gachasmack third en vas are rampaging on hoyo and cn players are combining with en players to rampage on hoyo devs fourth netease is about to sue them plagrisim becuz of copying their music from other game and use it on natlan
whales spend in a game thats popular
coz hoyo could neverthat there goal this and going forward
man it used to be such a nice and comfy game ps i still cant forgive them for not letting me hug firefly though
does all wuwa cc have nothing to do at all
         pay to win                                 poe   
yea global passive is like having a arcanine on your pokemon storage which constantly intimidates every opponent you encounter or gyarados with its pressure it doesnt seem unfair now imagine you got all those debuff pokemon on your storage and suddenly every opponent is weakened by a whole lot hsr might not be pvp but it tells a lot on how the end game enemies will be adjusted to make you pull for characters with their global passive
btw where r u from if u r from us this is just another rasic video
make castorice shirtless problem solved bodyblueraisedarmsbodyblueraisedarms
i think dawei may cry is gonna release sooner than i though
it depends on the region in indonesia its already on its way to
in my region its rated on app store and on playstore
in philippines its right now
you must not forget that many positive reviews in the playstore are botted and mhy has a history to use bots
hehe come to wuwa we have pineapple pizza and walking bath tub
dazbib wuwa have been more mystical in the recent patches when will we be back to black shores i have no clue
wow thats cool are you aware that nobody gives a s
richkero thats the charm of kuro games they drop the most goated story when u didnt know they will i talk from experience with pgr
its just a matter of time before this prediction becomes true
zephyrabysstrinity at least they are addressing the issues of old characters getting buffed but yeah
syahburei they should have made global passive being available for fp in any game powercreep is inevitable but they could atleast made it fp friendly
it might be a trick after the update
lmao your wrong they are already addressing powercreep and saying they will rework old characters to make them work well with new content
jithu_chilukuri finally my gallaghar will be relevant
zephyrabysstrinity ah i am talking about zz idk about hsr
zz dev team dropped yesterday dev talk video about buffing old characters and ensuring they become more future proof and they wont be just simply changing numbers
jithu_chilukuri well if theyre buffing zz characters its still a win for me since itll give me reason to again play it my hands were already full by playing genshin hsr and wuwa really hoping they dont follow their predecessors
and theyre right it isnt
you think the players care a few thousand people is nothing compared to the tens of millions of active lovers of the game
satireenjoyer like what tect say when time come and not favorable dont complain there alot players been trap after playing for so long and cant stop playing there are ppl love game just dont want support it due some reason you cant category those stop playing as they dont have love for the game
satireenjoyer the sales are already threw the roof the ccs grandstanding did nothing lmao
theyre a former hsr genshin impact player ofc theyre gonna talk about it yall always say this just to be dismissive to ignore those criticisms or feedbacks that are actually reasonable people like you always defend a multi billionaire acting like that company is a damn child
yes making videos dumbass
cheetogirboyver well i play for fun until all the fun gone when i try to defend my favourite game people just calling me hoyodg or hoyoclown
zervi probably because youre defending a multi billionaire company that is ignoring their players feedbacks and criticism you cant expect that everyone will agree with you and when the devs are being manipulative this game committed colorism and mocking cultures as much i love to play genshin impact this game cannot will never escape criticism its really not hard to accept it this game itself asks for players feedback and when the players did a feedback yall get pissed off people like you expect everything to be positive about this company and the game itself has no flaws people call you a hoyodog or a hoyoclown because youre defending their wrong actions and thats valid for people to complain
cheetogirboyver i didnt mad until i look at the comments they said star rail is a sht game that when i cant hold my anger they literally call every hoyoverse game is a sht game without even playing it go blame hoyoverse not my favourite game go ask da wei why he never listen to community no matter what they said i never say anything bad about wuthering waves because i also playing it and it good i said it good not because of the community i said the game bad
zervi da wei never listen because he doesnt have to whatever happen people keep funding the game
zervi i understand that youre angryz but you could literally just block and ignore them if you play the game for fun people who say that hoyoverse games are shit are probably used to be one of their games player also you said ask dawei why he never listens to the community ofc he never listens ever since they got popular you dont even realize that comment is being dismissive itself players have been asking artifact load outs what did they do nothing free star that is actually good nothing in this current update all they do is add some basic and bare minimum things to add in a game it took many updates for hoyoverse to finally add another slot for the expeditions a type of person like you has that if we continue being positive we might get what we want although this is a good idea but all you got is scraps that are bare minimum to add all i gotta say is that wake the fuck up hoyoverse is not a small company anymore theyre multibillionaire youre not in anymore wake the fuck up this game doesnt respect players time a simple skip button cant be even added when this game almost half a decade old you do realize why wuwa players talk shit about genshin impact because they used to be a former player of genshin impact most the things they said about genshin is true the devs never listen after many years of begging and asking bloated dialogues that you cant skip because the devs are really forcing you to listen to the story even myself a genshin player asks directly dawei he will not care because all he wants is money he can cry all he wants that players are critizing him ill never bow down to a fucking manipulative billionaire those players are human beings if the devs never listen to them for almost half a decade theyll feel unheard and lose hope for them thats just how it works a player like you has toxic positivity you guys are scared of criticism and acting in this game cant have flaws once its called out you guys go crazy
da wei wont listen because players like you will gracefully and positively eat whatever slop they feed you and fyi ive played both games you mentioned just in case you try to use that argument zervi
zervi they aint wrong when they say that hoyo games suck they are only good until you start comparing them with other games
saivupu really all hoyo game suck give a reason
the plot and lore one and the minigame part is so real because you can stop playing endgame content and still enjoy the game kind of if the lore is good and the events are fun but the story is so bad that it got me thinking if they fired all of their writers and are creating plots with ai because neither is genshin nor even hid doing good story wise either and the events are so meh
yep i think its really possible
essentially it would be like how guardian tales or even cookie run kingdom ended up being due to all the account wide bonuses that newer players would have to struggle to get thru to hope to catch up with the end game since most of them even with plenty of changes would require months or even an entire year of playing just to barely catch up at all this is why i absolutely abhorred gacha games that either replace units too fast or makes it extremely a pain in the arse to acquire units by either preparing them can take over an entire patch to just work on a single unit or they give effectively no breathing room if you have to play the rerun chasing game or something aka moral of the story pgr having gacha pity rates far lower then the competition and let you even acquire alot of additional goods thru alternative nongacha means makes even newer players able to catch up with alot more ease then something like honkai impact rds crap
wth is a rasic are you talking about an organization
cheetogirboyver i think he was saying basic video because well this is literally of gacha game ccs content nowadays
isnt it
kenkaneki o yeah i forget i always imagine him crying in every hoyo disaster news
danzfranz i think he does but not on camera anymore otherwise shareholders will treat him like lose
gtx bahahaha
hoyo went ahead with the global passive because they know their ccs and community would fold like paper and are just spineless people if kuro would did this they would get mass review bombed their ccs would riot the change would then be reverted and then they would give out astrites as compensation with an accompanying apology tweet kuro knows that power is on its players hoyo knows its players are slaves trapped in sunk cost fallacy
people really thought hsr is a good game especially when its made by hoyo after a month or two i knew its a shit game
i dont think it will be the fall of hsr yet but it starting to go therei bet when the banner come people will drop big bucks for it none of these drama will matter unfortunately
we were tricked into belebog and afterwards it was hoping that the story and game would improve beyond that moment of wildfire
being a koro games enjoyer is like the rich laughing at the homeless hoyoverse games in situations like these
i never played hsr but all this drama is entertaining to me
whats more of ittb is like a weakling mc
what a soundtrack my friend i started to play star rail for the story in because of robin but i didnt like what hoyoverse was doing with the game so i got robin and stopped playing maybe i would come back to the game after they release all x story i hope that i dont have to spend more than hours seeing black screens
welp this is why i play for fun i guess i never had a side to choose to begin with regardless of any dramaits all just been me and wellfrom a black teenage kid that has exaggerated swagger once said nah imma do my own thing so i will
they fell of the day they decided to fumble my glorious queen jingliu
castorice global passive cant revive this patch even worse the game itself
live stream when
imagine if hsr release a character that has global passive of disabling all global passive of all character that has one and it was given for free
fall of a game and the rise of another ratsu their words not mine idrc
i saw hsr review bomb its at stars at playstore
il say it again i will never understand how people believed in this game after genshin impacts blatant mistreatment honkai star rail players really thought they were better than genshin players and now they are at a worse low then them lmao
i wouldnt say the death of honkai yet it really depends on the next future unit and future unit when amphoreus is done
wowgiving normies gacha really ruined their brains
dead coffin game lets go
akivili is very disappointed now
well said
theres a good reason why the hoyoverse fans are hated everywhere
adriantepes well id rather them not get hated then who cares if theyre spineless theyre the ones losing money in the first place why do you care when someone else loses their money
in a nutshell hoyoverse has a fkton of marketing in place so they can make fantastic use of losing alot of money presence in the gacha landscape to force ccs to not immediately just drop out but they just kept pushing it without a care in the world even when popular ccs started to leave which since they got a massive pile of games now they could probably give less then a entire fk if one of them collapses if they can just use that drama to promote another game and just continue the cycle to corpse circulate it and likely make far more money in one game to keep the other ones afloat with ease that even if all thar games are garbage as long as one of them is wildly successful they can keep the others running to just musicial chair which one to make the most popular and the others to just be fodder to promote ones other then themselves by being bad to make other ones look good kurogames actually understands regardless of what the stockholders demand if they dont appease the playerbase then they cant really make the money the stockholders would get back if they constantly flip off the playerbase much less keep the business running overall though stockholders is just a supplement to help with the games development not the mandatory driving factor on the game itself also why when i finally had to replace my honda accord finally after having it for nearly ish years i decided to pay in full for my next car immediately to not have to deal with any taxes or liabilities known as interest because thats what stockholders and catering to the market instead of the consumers always does the one who actually consume the media are the ones that should be your priority not the ones just using said media as some money laundering get rich with ease scheme by just humping a popular product and get more money outta it as it gets popular and the stockholder gets more greedier in the process
jaredjosephsongheng nonono u dont understand hoyoshills get hated because how obnoxious they are any arguments made for their fav game will never be accepted
man u have mental problem about prejudice and illusion
bladeserph mental illness man get a job
you could say hoyo players are getting screwed by the fallacy of no return
kharismanando ok and so what about that if they want to be stupid and just keep spending then just let them do so eventually theyll realize their stupidity but nope you guys keep attacking them giving them an incentive to keep playing to get more unified
jaredjosephsongheng cause it sets a precident one company pulls it off others will follow kuro may not but others do and soon its the entire industry look at microtransactions they were a way for fp games to earn money for future content and server upkeep now its in every fullprice game on the planet why cause people reacted like you just did who cares its their money thats lost not mine soon it will be yours if every game ever has global passives and microtransactions and whatever other crap these greedy ass companies can come up with that nobody speaks up about cause its not my problem its someone elses haha oh shit nothing to play anymore cause every game is star rail now
fr they cant take any form of criticism adriantepes
jaredjosephsongheng once enjoyed gi but because of brainless community game never improved so it is necessary to keep roasting these shills and making sure they dont spill into other games
frankenstein_ just like how mtx started with the infamous horse armor in skyrim now mtx has become the norm in video games
jaredjosephsongheng no no theyre not hated because of that theyre hated because how ignorant and poisonous they are most of them never ever played any other game in their life before so their fandom is full of casuals dont know anything about games so they whine about fanservice even on games that isnt made by hoyo plaguing its content without even playing the game just check any character in any gacha game and youll see bunch of clown hoyoshills that says umm thats x from insert hoyo game character copy why do you think wuwa players hate them so much you cant find a single character in wuwa where this clowns wont call a copy they dont know how to be treated by their company so hoyo does the most scummy addition with minimal complaints normalizes it and it poisons other gacha games moving forward thats why every single gaming fandom hates them tldr its the biggest most ignorant mosty whiny and most poisonous fandom
jaredjosephsongheng because it encourage the developers to ruin their own game for that same money which ruins our fun
hoyo only listens to their chinese community if the chinese community doesnt care devs wouldnt care also as for now the global passive has no significant impact and castorice overall design has far more popularity than the reception of her global passive revive is negligible for old players to newbies its a quality of life
frankenstein_ the industry is being fed by the players if everyone stops paying then the industry literally stops its not like other live service games in which if they screw up they can just refuse to fix their game and just take your money no they need the players more than the players need them just because it happened in the past doesnt mean its happening now gacha games are not full price they are free with zero ads as well
dilucsf the chinese community does care actually theres already tons of videos outside of mrpokke about the reception of the global passive also calling a characters kit that you need to pull a quality of life is exacly what hoyo wants if it were a qol they wouldve given it out for free and no its not the gp that castorice has thats the issue its the groundwork that has been laid for more powercreep especially with the company history of doing that
richkero as long as the global passive remains to be this one we have i dont think its enough to ensure enough outrage seeing the leaks for i have yet to still see the next global passive one only rumors ive already seen cipher and hyacine and theres none im still waiting for the rumored emanators in amphoreus like phainon and cyrene and more there are global passive with them too according to rumors but its not confirmed i just wish the global passives will only affect overworld difficulty if hsr develops a more complicated overworld
jaredjosephsongheng because it encourages this behavior in all upcoming gachas making any other possible game unplayable
zamatesenpai if its unplayable then dont play it soon enough theyll be in the red
jaredjosephsongheng maybe we can stop being complacent and try to prevent it from happening in the first place this just dont playjust ignore mentality is stpid we cant let the hoyo community off the hook because they fold like paper
jaredjosephsongheng maybe we can stop being complacent and try to prevent it from happening in the first place lol
_thestormthatisapproaching what if we let this happen wont this also lead to more of these greedy gacha companies to be exposed and having them be more exposed means we can end up dealing damage to them ubisoft ea activision and many others tried prioritizing profit over actually making good games and see what has happened to them now
jaredjosephsongheng blud thats not through complacency that we expose anything youve got it completely confused nice try though
_thestormthatisapproaching complacency is a risk but its a risk we should be willing to make im saying we should leave the hoyo community to themselves and we attack anyone else who does this except hoyo like that shouldnt be too hard we have many communities here now and with games such as ananta nte and all of those other games coming out that probably have gacha systems similar to wuwa then hoyo will eventually fade into obscurity wont it by attacking them we are merely making them ignore whats in front of them because someone is attacking a game they really like
there is a reason we call hoyotards they slurp anything their master throws at them
people are not folding they just arent pathetic like you clowns even fp player are literally getting free pulls why are you crying in a false reality that your echo chamber creates
jaredjosephsongheng that isnt the reason its because they are toxic players hate on everything that isnt mihoyo even though kuro proven they doing it better
jaredjosephsongheng wasting your breath you have no clue what you talking about when toxic community props up ccs it gives green light to mihoyo to do shitty practices if people will still spend on a shit product of course they will go steam ahead
just let be hoyotards keep being idiot and playing their game at least we left for good
ironically the only comparison i can make now is the following kuro has terrible launch and other stuff but after a while enters great redemption arc both pgr and wuwa hoyo nice launch and stuff hsr zz but lives long enough to be become a villain
lmao its not that serious its just a character you guys are a joke
littleangryowl to be fair genshin had awfully shit launch if it aint for tje pandemic its just an another gacha game
prayherta your life is a joke
ryiune yeah ive heard about it and thats why i mentioned only those two
_thestormthatisapproaching my comment got removed so thats great
kyotheman thats like a mere small percentage of the community idk why you guys are so mad about a small percentage of the entire whole
kyotheman no shit sherlock i said to stop attacking the players not the ccs
adriantepes their behavior on twitter really doesnt help also honestly
no they wouldnt kuro is a game made for whales they will do exactly what they want like they have been your opinion doesnt matter and you know nothing of what they would do
arsmariastarlight i see what you did there
belobog era was the best time i spent on a game in while thinking back about it brings me to tears
citoyenneteavanttout it just easy to read not so deep extra part of belobog about sell the land to company more depth but hsr player cant read idk why they never talk about wardance and hoolay when he is most great vilian we eveer have
it was improved penacony amphoreus is already better
typemoonfansashi nah penacony was a mess of a story where the direction felt like it shifted from patch to patch and amphoreus loses several points because the presentation is god awful
xbladevanitas presentation was already improved since and i agree to disagree
xbladevanitas panacony had better ideas belobog was like any mid shonen storie
clip better ideas dont mean anything if the execution is terrible penacony was schizophrenic from update to update with cliffhangers that just get hand waved off without any real payoff and other major events just happening off screen
yeah the space china arc was a sheer disappointment given that one of the astral express members and one of the stellaron hunters shared a deep history with that placeonly for it to be skimmed over because muh gacha what a waste of what could have possibly been the best arc only for it to be the absolute worst
xbladevanitas for real penacony arc was mid and much of the new characters were boring in my opinion
typemoonfansashi keep slorbgorbin hoyoverse lol
tubadude sorry that i really enjoy the stories and not repeat everything a cc said
typemoonfansashi presentation improved but its still considered baby steps compared to genshin which already looks cheap compared to wuwa
bunnysenpai well thats the wuwa community in a nutshell getting down to genshin tier in terms of toxic behavior
the loufu was ok to but after thst zip
typemoonfansashi hoyoturd detected lol
typemoonfansashi people just love to complain lol
xbladevanitas no not really i like penacony actually yes there are countless flaws eg moralism and forced moral high ground unnecessary dialogues in the main quest that makes it unnecessarily overstretched but the general diversity of characters the worldbuilding and its visual aesthetics philosophy and vibes were unmatched personally aventurine sunday and a part of acherons stories were my top favorites aventurine at top though some of smaller issues was acherons involvement in the whole plot and her unnecessary appearance most of the time same applies to the trailblazers since sunday had solid philosophical and metaphysical backing to validate him i wrote a k letter essay about that and sunday but ill keep it to later masked fools were nice especially sampo but the hanu adventures and sparkle side shenanigans were a bit unnecessary
solariusaureum nah penacony was a mess if you actually follow everything thats happening in the plot firefly and robin get killed setting up a mystery gets side tracked by aventurines entire story till the end where oh gallagher is revealed as the one behind the deaths in penacony immediately throws all that away because death is the only way in the dream to reach the place gallagher wanted to show everyone because reasons that arent clear does this mean later on death stabbed boothill to get there for the really stupid monkey crap thats the absolute worst thing i have ever seen story wise sunday and the order just being the surprise villain at the end felt really rushed the pacing was all over the place and felt like hoyo couldnt focus on just one thing along with the fact that no one in penacony can just speak normally they all have to speak in the most drawn out cryptic nonsense not even gonna say anything about sparkle because she really didnt matter in the slightest
xbladevanitas some of you said is true but the rest is just pure babble sunday order being the actual antagonists wasnt really a surprise if you actually followed up the buildup from earlier and the philosophy dialogue they were presenting but yeah to me acherons part vs aventurine and the ones in that range is what felt rushed and horrible to me though
typemoonfansashi well some wuwa players are old genshin players so
if you think this is laughing matter wait brother there more charectors are coming with ridiculous global passive like critspeed buff its pure comedy with hoyo and its cc playerbase
isnt that just admitting you have a superiority complex
jaredjosephsongheng honestly the right terminology would be the commoner who has simple enjoyments and consistently has good fortune shaking thar head at the sight of rich folks who brag about being so successful but they are actually in crippling debt and those rich folks keep denying the fact they are literally strapped to a machine pumping blood out of them to pay off said debts and really its better to have a positive healthy outlook that simply sees and gets things in life that are just good in general then having to ignore with toxic positivity even when they have nearly or more of the cast they pulled for even years in a game being replaced by a bunch of units that are even more expensive then nearly half of the cast you pulled in those years just like how plenty of people got overly pissed at the insanely expensive skins in league of legends including the whole faker skin for ahri which even faker would not use itsince i recall he was the type of person to not use skins in lol as far as i remember and it apparently would cost something like high hundreds to acquire said skins and it even resulted in players straight up dodging games soon as anyone used said skin to never wanting to see that whale skin ever in that game point n case though too many companies got overly greedy and need to enjoy some restraints being slapped on to reel them back into more reasonable practices since some straight up made mobile gaming businesses too lucrative of a cash cow due to unrestraint practices
requiem never a speed buff man it conflict to antifact
jaredjosephsongheng i mean why not even those upcoming games such as ananta arknights enfield etc will also laugh at hoyoverse for their donkey brain tactics and the ccs of hoyo and playerbase hoyoshills of hoyo are also bunch of donkeys grouped in a single community at this point i have long since lost trust in hoyo games and even have hoyo trauma towards other gacha games
keous and this kinda thing and attacking hoyo community always is what really steps back progress for change in hoyo games ngl the more people attack the more the community will unite the more the community unites the less of a chance we will have any form of change occuring
keous my only trauma are pvp gacha games because they are pw
and this is why i hate the kuro community they think they are better just because they play a different game
jithu_chilukuri of course better because kuro know how to treat player not like hoyo who love drain player money with making problem and sell solution into new character dont forget powercreep makes old characters useless even they give them away for free
reymwrk thats why zz and hsr will have character buffs and no nobody is better for enjoying a different game this elitist mindset of you is the reason why people start to hate the genshin community in the first place its kinda ironic that many wuwa players adapt this toxic behavior
same been playing pgr for years now the moment i saw kuro was making an open world game i quit genshin right after that i just knew they were gonna deliver and they did
typemoonfansashi done yapping first buffed characters doesnt mean make character overpower just make it have average dmg like patch newest support and i dont think that buffed character will last long second this elitist doesnt make community get hated because i speak to actual fact that hoyo is greedy and always give mid content or storytelling make the game is deserve to get alot criticism but they only listen to cn community lmao for genshit getting alot hate is because their first anniversary is shit and start bombing star review to any other gameapp that action make genshit is become public enemy then always compare to any new openworld game to their game and start genshin killer statement ig they stop comparing because already lose to wuwa so cant compare to new openworld like nte ananta wangyue ak enfield etc after that playing victim when their loved game is lose cuz shit quality because their dev is lazy to improve start saying why wuwa always compare to us comparing waves well only zz is last chance if they do same like gi and hsr its over for hoyo
you think enjoying kuro games makes you some elite rich gamer nah its just a preference not a status symbol both have their merits but this rich vs homeless analogy thats not a hot take its just delusional
jithu_chilukuri its an analogy dummy
jithu_chilukuri rich and homeless change that analogy to player and cashcow if u dont get what i mean
yeah right you guys just hate the game because its not giving freebies thats it fp players are so entitled
yeah another hoyo bad guy
you can call hoyoverse hoyoshill hoyoshit hoyogreed hoyotrash hoyoturd etc
reymwrk yall love to talk abt powercreep genshin has been here since yet you can beat the whole game with characters up to
__dinho yea thx to element reaction but can hsr do the same with old character each game has their problem like gi qol locked behind limited character and hsr is powercreep
jithu_chilukuri whatever u said but i regret spending my money for bp in this game
reymwrk hsr is buffing old characters on the next patch most of genshin qol works on any character
its even better being a pgr player we just keep winning
realfrenchgaming i love pgr
im glad i quit honkai star rail the moment acheron joined the game i noticed how unfair it waswhy cant seele deal this kind of damage the game feels completely unbalanced now because new characters deal way more damage than the older ones making early units feel totally outclassed the reason i even started playing hsr was because of a friend but when i pointed out how broken acheron was he just said maybe its because of the lore i told him we should quit and check out other gacha games instead when wuthering waves was about to drop i told him we should play thatbut he refused saying he couldnt handle another gacha game honestly i think the real reason he cant quit hsr is because hes stuck in the loop of predatory metacreep characters and hes too deep in to see how bad its gotten
same here i never played hsr genshit was a lot for me but glad to see another hoyoboobs game fall down not because i hate hoyboobs but because i want them to feel threatened i want them to stop playing the deaf blind and start listening i want them to stop releasing childish silly updates designed for unders i want them to go back to the roots to the true story gods wars dark plots evil organizations dragons lurking in the shadows i want more of dainsleif the fatui the sinners the hexenzirkel the abyss order the prmordial dragons niblung the shining shades khaenriah celestia and the big taboos who the f cares about cowgirl cena ben sharkgirl or a fangus we are talking about calamities that wiped out entire nations gods wars and hoyoboobs want me to hear the cute story of sandslash pokmon
i left it after the first area it got boring really fast to me
same i play wuthering and im like really is this the shit you play and defend
december uninstall even if they offer k stellar jade im good
same
i sell my account forgot it was firefly rerun sundayfugue banner include gi and havent regret anything just enjoy some drama because the community that defend this shlt is looks like a clown which makes it funnier
i left a little bit after getting silver wolf and her light cone which was good because she got completely shafted by hoyo in later updates
i wish i never played mihoyo is awful company got lazy devs hi was there only decent game
gameonline hoyboobs wtf is that most call them mihoshills or hoyoshills
emptiness we are too one less clown to see on the community oh no i forgot you pretenders are always around dispite your numerous claim on quitting
im glad i quit this game after i finishing penacony main quest
more interesting than the game sometimes bro like its good but there js almost nothing to do this is like our pvp content
i was started playing hsr because i want some turn based strategy game at first it was like that it was fun you need to build team comp with same weaknesses enemies has but now its just bigger dmg no strategy or brain needed to play this game you just boom theyre dead unbalanced power level that keeps on power creep every patch and every thing go way too fast to the point you need to pull most of the new unit to clear end game witch is of the game without it this just a dry ass game that you wait an entire month for new story and so i quit
exactly tb is just a meme generator at this point not the main character
some people believe that tb is a good mc
look i understand calling him a meme generator or irrelevant but weak mc right now is pretty strong being a demigod and all that stuff
ilikegames i guess so but tb is not enough to solo dan heng by his dragon form welt casually using a black hole or even fighting a bug that almost killed him i just hope he will have some training arc shit as such and he doesnt need to rely on others to be honest as the new story of the option of saying acheron is here and such which is stupid and it means he wanted help like i know its a joke option but no man youre not sampo
in hsr you can pull for the characters that you like if and only if you are a tourist
adriantepes thats true im not a newbie in the gacha space though just in my own personal place pace
wait thats so real
i dont think itll just be the patch but it summarizes it neatly
i have a feeling this wont impact hoyo much the community will be different but ppls will still eat this up
saberdud facts you dont know what is the issue gentard now is more handful than castorice issue alone gets fine for million dollars they randomly fire alot of their employees en vas are all rampaging all ccs are quiting their games including gentard then now their mascot va en rampaging and they will face plagirism in the court soon lol from a certain game company becuz of plagrisim of music lol now its hoyos fall down as whole not just hsr devs alone
castorice killed the game
kblazeww million is like nothing to them they fired their localizers because they suck en vas got called out for trying to make a monopoly and are crashing out over it idk about all ccs since ive seen a couple start to get back into the fold paimon va started crashing out because shes a bitch weird its been so many months now and what happened to that lawsuit oh right yeah the same company that filed the lawsuit for onmyoji plagiarism also decided to steal music from genshin
exoskel castorice is death after all so yeah
wuwa is the best game
exoskel castorice will be one of their biggest banners ever so quite the opposite
hold up this writing is fire
awaken ratking lvl
keep cooking whoever wrote this
right same cycle ratsu defending genshin from bald guy now jokke defending hsr from a bald guy its like a new arc saga
another ratsumr pokke facebluewideeyes
oh yes trolling a guy because he gave a different opinion from me
jithu_chilukuri opinions can be divided to correct and wrong ones pokke said one thing then another and now he and his community defending hoyo going against wellbeing of playerbase this is example of wrong opinion tectone said one thing then repeated then repeated then rep and his community warns others about game getting worse and tries to take action to prevent the fall using objective facts this is example of correct opinion
trolling a dude cuz he is the one to throw an aoe taunt every evening jithu_chilukuri
jithu_chilukuri exactly these cant be real people
leathermage no thats not how opinions work also what is this made up bullshit yall have crafted lmao and tectone is a moron hes not a saint for taking a stand in a game he doesnt play lmao
ronron_gaming soon zz version
hes friends with the rat lord what yall expect
yes let that trash game rot in hell
same will happen with zz players think their dev is god send but miyabis release is already a grim foreshadowing of whats next
pikaachoo well see at the very least if the dev note hold through till nd aniv
zacknothere i already know they will give us hollow zero skill in end game content omg i feel like my value of pull not get powercreep it just increse every patch if they really do that somebody will pull old character because a lot of skill set they get from hollow zero genius move
but whats even worse is they cant even leave to greener pastures given how theyre already barred from wuwa theyll have to settle for wvd which i heard has much shittier gacha than the big cn games so yeah theyre cooked
already seen this coming because i played hi once powercreep in hsr skyrocketed i knew instantly its heading down the same path as its predecessor
mleong let me guess hi has just as bad powercreep as hsr
let me break it down for you its cause theyre different games
pikaachoo moronic comment
cultureaddct let me break it down for you its the same company same company policies
couldnt care less actually some people are just over concern about meta they cannot stand if they cannot have the best characters the best clears whereas they are others who may not necessarily clear moc or anything but still enjoy the game for its story unique take on turn based gameplay upon the issue of meta this can cause problems yes but to a carefree chap that enjoys story aesthetic they couldnt care less still people should quit if they want to thats best for them
whydoyouask first of all people who care a lot about the meta just pull for the most meta units thats just another strategy for gachas to make money what youre complaining about is most likely the people who complain about powercreep which is valid cause itll start to affect people like us most people who dont whale on characters or endlessly chase the meta
rickynguyen it was very bad but not anymore
vergil i doubt that considering that this is mihoyo were talking about hi still has terrible powercreep
rickynguyen not as much as before they somewhat fixed it trust me its better than hsr and i have been playing hi for more than years now
pikaachoo i only played zz briefly and managed to get both miyabi and her engine other characters just dont hit the same it every sense of the term forgive me ben its not you okay actually it kinda is
relax lil bro its not that serious its just one character holy sh you guys are a joke
so far w genshin im doing okay and have decent characters but i dont have enough resin to properly build them so theyre kinda bad atm
prayherta i know right they will whine but the precedent it sets when they have nothing but giant leaps in assumptions and guessing to justify their outrage they complain that not every update has a massive climactic finale a bunch of them want a skip button cause they never cared about story at all is the game perfect no has it given me incredible moments and characters absolutely
and i will never understand the need of people to one up each other over playing video games or insult those people as side watchers are we really that dumb as a species now that we have to compete about what entertain us idiots every single one of you
i was hopeful as i enjoyed the game but i saw signs coming of this
rickynguyen id honestly say its worse since the weapons and stigmatas basically like relicsartifacts are gotten from gachas and only some really weak alternatives can be crafted
cosmixhuo what really so theres nothing fp that is nearly as good as the gacha weapons and stigmata since only very weak alternatives could be made i know hi was terrible with its powercreep but to not this extent yeah hi has no hope left in itself like every game that mihoyo has made the sooner it dies the better for everyones sanity
rickynguyen yeah im taking a break from playing it because of that despite it having my absolute favorite characters like elysia and kiana the mc but the lack of fp options for my characters pmo so bad i just stopped i never really deleted my account or anything i just stopped playing it this plus the story is ss after the mc kinda disappeared its a long story too literally xd im really sad that hsr is rather quickly descending down the path of its predecessor since at the beginning it had lots of hope and even during penacony i had a strong feeling that it could be a great game due to the hype it evoked in the community me included it was truly peak and then amphoreus happened and everything went downhill its sad and even more so seeing wuwa doing much better though the community there isnt my favorite to be entirely honest but this is just my take lol
its genshin players who think that they are better ofcourse you guys were praying on the downfall of star rail i personally cant stand genshin players so whiny and elitist yall always bashed every nee game out in hopes of recruiting others into genshin
cosmixhuo i like kiana as a main character too elysia was written well whether she comes back as good as ever remains to be seen especially with the current story being complete garbage compared to part the current story leaves a lot to be desired
rickynguyen yeah from what ive seen in the hird official page on insta its gotten so random im genuinely confused and then the random mentions of kiana like wasnt she on the moon and the way the designs feel solackluster lately the same color scheme over and over again i miss the senti era ngl
cosmixhuo agreed mihoyo are nothing more than pathetic lazy losers now hi is basically a weak shell of its former self designs are bland generic and boring the sheer randomness in the current story is just pure trash
in the next six months or more there will be no characters with global passives i wonder what peoples reaction will be if nothing happens after that amount of time
 there will be more to come
phainon is confirmed to have a global passive this game is a goner
notsamaxd no
adriantepes its clear but i have big doubts that it will happen in the next year and that it will be gamebreaking
people said the same thing during pennacony its just delaying the realization
exactly they are so entitled
never going back hoyoverse is dead to me theyve proven time and time again that they are anti consumer
honkai fumbled so hard
""
i guess castorice is not bringing you back
dont play gatcha games and your soul is free
id rather play arknight or blue archive because its one of those decent gacha games compare to those hoyogreed games
costumers are those who pay not fp
snyro arknights and ba pity lmao
certifiedprecog i would ratha play arknighas and blue archive mayne dey got za best gaytcha gaem system brah same stuff as hsr but indie
only you dead the sales of castorice is crazy good better than firefly wuwuwawa can only kiss hsr feet not even one percent of hsr sales
its your fault playing gacha games
snyro bro what
i can understand and get behind the idea that you want the game to be better but at the same time i think youre looking at it wrong if your requirements for it to be better is essentially to be more complex and have all those mechanics you speak of other turnbased rpgs generally have it is not the design intent they are striving for to make the game as complex as those rpgs that should be quite clear does that mean the game cant improve no they can improve and do their interpretation of the genre better but i dont think the solution to that is by making it more complex
you really think its impractical for most players not to engage with endgame endgame is mostly what you see content made around online but i really do think its true that most are just there for the story and some surface level engagement with the combat between the teenagers enamored with the world and characters more than the gameplay and older working adults that dont have the time or energy to sink into hardcore gameplay there are large demographics of people who are totally casual with the game heck my mother plays the game and she cannot stand combat focused content simulated universe is her worst nightmare theyre out there and in great number to them the little side quests collectables and hidden jokes are the content to go alongside the main story the minigame events are there for a reason good video by the way just thought that particular take was a bit silly
global passive shows they are more interested in selling stuff for your account and not make interesting team balance
pretty reasonable take especially like the item analogy it was on spot same thoughts about passive it aint something to worry about by itself it just can have a real bad consequences if the right things fall into wrong hands and yeah i am also feeling a bit down about state of the game too ive used to spend on the battle pass and monthly sub but now it is just sub and i am thinking about stopping that too weird feel because i like the characters and am still invested into some of em like i am currently hoarding all the currencies i manage to get into castorice fund no whaling though only daily drops and what you can get by playing buut i am just not feeling to spend time inside the game aside of daily activities feels bad man
i appreciate your opinion bro one of the clearest statement video out there about this global passive nice video i watched it until the end
personally i felt cringe with feixiao being super saiyan in her ult but im not saying she is bad or horrible or whatever its my irrelevant opinion and also i came here to see what exactly is going on that makes everyone hate the game so much with castorice or global passive as im not sure what the problem is and to be fair i think im part of the minority that is completely fine with the game i have no issues with the story the only issue i have is the current protests which is somewhat understandable ai is trash but this is kind of being taken over the top a bit i dont really know much and it must be ignorant of me to not be as educated but currently people have gotten too comfortable in complaining about every small detail every patch people are complaining about it or are complaining about the same small thing like a list of who knows what for what knows who to be able to whatever the everwhat much easier im also just ranting my brain is scattered too so i may be more incoherent in what i typed and i apologize for that also sorry about the opinions i have but theyre my opinions nonetheless thank you for reading this
oror hear me out you are tolerating bad and ungrateful devs and you are mostly part of the bigger problem and is why the game is not yet dead but guaranteed heading in that way in its earliest date
i dont chase meta i play endgame and get what i can and if i cant get all stars i dont care but thats me
i personally dont care about anout the global passive i just play hsr and enjoy the game people who made can be mad about it but they act like children at this point all these adult are just kids pretending to be adult now no player should play a game they dont enjoy but dont attack those who still enjoy it and those who enjoy it dont attack those who hates it people who say leave yeah just leave i dont care if it drops views etc this will teach hoyo to change their game if you are unhappy uninstall the game and stopped talking about it this goes for cc as well
cant wait to drop at least next week
lmao dislyte now dogshit maximum predatory game
bro i advise you stop using big words if you dont know how to pronounce them
the people saying most hsr players dont play or care about end game are in fact mihoyo fake social media accounts spreading propaganda so people dont complain about the companies predatory practice
im far to invested into the game to quit playing now i actually look at leaks so i knew this global pass was coming and i properly saved for it
huh im like with your opinion on people quitting about castorice global passive as someone who has quit before the passive and once i heard the leaks about the passive it solitifed my ideals to quit i dont think everyone quit to bandwagon but i see your point i think more people should have maid a stink about arheron and her talent being quality of life locked behind her first so i understand as i am watching the video i totally agree
has anyone checked how china feels about the current hsr cause by now the devs already know that americans love to complain and in recent years have become insufferable ruining gaming companys and what not but also their core audience is china not america
classic iyo take lol
just want to say the idea that fp dont matter something ive seen a lot including in comments is actually false they just matter in a different way for example during the genshin boycott though i was also upset by the situation and felt the disrespect i knew the majority of players were still going to spend andor play in fact it was encouraged to play but not spend because of server costsit was never worth getting into this with anyone but i saw legit one person ever mention it fp matter from a numbers perspective literally hey investors hey advertisers hey sponsors look at how many active players we have so technically fully quitting hurts a bit but not in the way most people think it does it doesnt hit their bottom line because at the end of the day any company offering free games technically has to be able to sustain the game as if no players are spending
the problem with hsr is its only premeditated ive said this for a long ass time and the pushback i got was all jrpgs are premeditated this is incorrect and if you think that youve not played enough good jrpgs hsr is about what team you have and what relics they have equipped after that you can just do a rotation and win vast majority of other jrpgs are about the tactics you use within the fight itself this is not to say some parts of jrpgs arent premeditated there is prep that you can do to make the fights easier but there is a healthy balance between strategy during the combat and premeditation before it hsr has very little strategy within the moment it attempts to offload that lack of depth in its boss designs but its already losing compared to a jrpg that breath and depth in character actions alongside bossenemy design ironically a huge problem with genshin impact is the premeditated nature of it beating abyss is about the team you build after that you just bash out your rotations
i dont mind the approach to the battle design and having auto fun button but im missing the ability to use items in battle
mihoyo account
i do think there are number of people that dont care about endgame maybe they play it maybe they dont but they def just care about enjoying the story i remember i was watching i creator and they were near the place were you do apoc and they said this mode is for tryhards and that blew my mind someone who has dedicated a relevant portion of their life to this game thinks that one of the few things to actually do and use your characters for us only for the highest percent of players not for ur average player so yes a there is meaningful amount of people that dont care about endgame who spend money on the game so why would hoyo care
i was a day player and i loved the game at the beginning hell the only reason i even gave it a try was because i sucked at turn based games and i thought hsr would help me learn how to play them better but by the time came out i didnt like direction it was going so i dropped it luckily i stopped playing it without spending too much money on it like i did when i was playing genshin
the only time genshin folded somehow was with the zhongli drama as for star rail i cant recall anything
this game is a shit show
the only way to win the battle its move on you cant talk to someone who is ignoring you thaan i did it i was waiting for the collab but this live make it clear this company dont care even for the low spender so if you dont care about me is natural that you lose me
honestly im at a point where i might be done with honkai star railnot because of the game itself the global passive or the socalled lack of content ive played all the content as an fp since day one and its fun most of the time and ive actually been more invested in zenless zone zero lately but whats really been pushing me away is the community its become so toxic and entitled at times i get itpeople want content that excites them and they take the game more seriously than others thats fair but some folks forget this game is going to be what the devs want it to be and its not going to be for everybody which is okay most players are just here for the story the characters and a chill experience i think theres a huge divide between casual and hardcore players and the hardcore side often comes off as loud and arrogantacting like their way to play is the only right way and everyone else is wrong that attitude is what kills the vibe if someones unhappy with the game quitting is totally valid but the constant negativity and aggression towards the game and community thats what makes it unbearable if i stop playing star rail its not because of the devsits because of the community
off topic your room is looking so tidy that my ocd is at peace
im gonna take a break from this game for awhile jusg dont have the drive to want to play anymore
um what seriously characters already do this but you need them in the team to work is the game impossible if you use a firefly team that doesnt have an e fu this is a gatcha game they add character mechanics that make the game easier in new characters as long as the existing characters can still beat the game even if a bit more difficult there really isnt a problem
i know i cant quit the game since i enjoy it on occasions along with the story for me im just not gonna summon for castorice anaxa just seems a bit better for my account
i quit because the game doesnt offer anything competitive no guilds no leader boards no pvp its just a anime that you can play with the characters turn base game players are competitive
castorice is just another nail in the coffin that is hsrs death knell at this point so much missed opportunity lack of innovation lack of meaningful mechanics fan favorite characters are no longer viable or relevant in the story its fallen to an unfortunate cycle of catering almost exclusively to the repeat spenders a patch because the monthly stuff isnt nearly enough with the character throughput theyre going for and thats fine ultimately its the devs choice to make it so aggressive to replace old units i just dont vibe with the current trajectory or really any of the characters anymore
regarding the argument around fp players actually matter one of the main reasons whales whale even if it isnt a conscious thing is for the bragging rights i have a better account than most people if there arent any fp players a big incentive for whales to spend money is gone this increases with online competitive games i believe there are some pvp gachas out there or gachas with leaderboards hird if there arent fp players those whales arent better than anyone why would they whale for a leaderboard where everybody whales to some degree this applies to single player gachas lets be honest at some point everyone of us bragged about how well build a character is or look i got lucky and got the character and the weapon or i got dupes of this character hope i made my argument clear tldr whales subconsciously or consciously whale to be better than the average fp player not having fp players in the ecosystem means whaling is even more pointless than it already is because they aint better than anyone this increases with multiplayer gachas or gachas with leaderboards
the way i spend around these gacha games has been maybe i get the daily pass the battlepasses and then the first time top ups to guarantee a character or two and thats based on how i felt playing the game for the previous year i pull waifu over meta most of the time it just so happens the waifus i pull plus aventurine are meta or will be much like the cases of jade and topaz there are some sacrifices that need to be made like i cant pull every waifu so my account lacks characters like robin and lingsha hard choices have to be made and some endgame cycles are more painful than others so yes im pulling castorice
ive been annoyed with the game for a while now i never pulled for acheron aventurine was a far more important grab for me i didnt pull yunli as i hate her character and her entire introduction made her seem like a disrespectful brat and then i didnt pull feixiao lingsha or fugue because i wanted other characters and i was punished for it with how powerful mobs were growing i have no powerful wind dps for instance apart from black swan they dont encourage variety anymore like they did before i usually am annoyed doing su or du they can be fun but theyre tedious to go through just to have save files to begin farming for planars a whole other hunk of nonsense to do before you can farm necessary things looking back there were moments in penacony where the story felt painful which is how felt i was so burnout from it that i didnt explore once after the story then the one character i wanted from amphoreus is just an autobattler and the global passive was the final straw if youre reading this please know there are three more at least coming i dont care what your cope argument is this should not be defended whatsoever they will be building this game around assumptions of everyone having these gp characters the others buff attack and skill levels you cannot defend this if you have a working brain for any form of forethought i uninstalled after grabbing mydei and will never look back
tbf using cas as an exit point is both a pr stunt and a good time to exit the game the two are not in the opposite in the slightest is the proverbial last drop i mean the one time where they admitted the fuck up was with zhongli but to this day there are units that do not work as intended
sighanother hoyo game i stop playing please dont do this to zz
leave the damn game go play a real turn base game
genshin has too zhongli buffs and neuvilette bug revert both had zero reliance on the global playerbase to occur
ive started playing since jinglius debut my account has gone through many losses but also many lucky pulls some of them very lucky most importantly ive spent a hefty bunch on the game the decisions i made on my pulling choices have led my account to be in quite a good state so i dont need castorice and ill probably go for the fox guy for my acheron instead either way i think the global passive is fine only if it also gets applied to stars but then again the last star added was moze and it was like patches ago cant remember whatever the situation may be im never spending money on hsr again the game i loved is quite literally going downhill extremely fast and i dont see it in a good state in years time with powercreep hp inflation and now global passives ill keep playing because i still love the story enjoy the gameplay and like the game but i wont hesitate to move on if im not having fun anymore lol
yeah peoples too emotional about this game
i just rearranged everything too
iyoverse great work i know is not easy to keep it that way though daily activities can get messy
i feel the need to add this on i dont hate castorice she has a beautiful design awesome animations stupid damage and a freaking dragon she was going to sell but thats exactly why theyre putting this on her they know what theyre doing theyll use her guaranteed sales from people that just like her to push the other planned gp units and its sickening
and fp that were planning to pull her anyway dont care
this is where you move on to final fantasy
i stopped spending my money on hsr for about a month now and at this point im just hanging on until the fate collab and if i see no changes in characters or modes im gonna leave and enjoy the storie through youtube videos
and the rating of honkai star rail on google playstore keeps nose diving now down to which is the lowest of all hoyoverse games today wuwa zz genshin hsr they now technically became the second genshin impact the reviews rained down lots of star rating due to powercreep pw shop and global passive
i never understood this comment about most players not doing endgame as if they didnt need to do it to get currency to pull characters these people think they give enough pulls on events and exploration most exploration gives pulls at best each individual map with annoying puzzles and su gives tons of pulls but it takes so long to do it that unless youre willing to spend hours farming that youll never have enough pulls to get any character this patch literally had events big events and one of these you can finish in hours and the other is just another su revamp
for me as long as the game has zero pvp the global passive does not bother me
the only time i think genshin ever folded was the outcry about zhongli being weak he got emergency buffed with the quickness oh right and the recent neuvillette thing where he got nerfed then they took it back and gave us a free pull because of it everyone was hoping theyd do that for dehya but nah lol
take i quit several months ago after playing a couple of hours of the story honestly started falling off after belabogthe fact that we dont have a skip button with summary is crazy i like story and dialogue but not when its bad ive got better things to do than spam x hsr was my main and i spent thousands on it but as soon as my multi eidalon characters started struggling im out for me to come back ill need skippable dialogue with summary better story and dialogue make older characters relevant dont waist my time by putting a mini game on overworld chests
im only playing because i wanted to save enough pulls to get the fate characters and thats it after that im not sure what ill do next if the mechanics of the game dont change for the better
what you said about people not only quit quitting the game over global passives might be true but were not gonna pretend like the passives arent a massive melon sized cherry on top right
bro forgot gepard
my guy youre talking about virtual currency that is infinite in quantity that hoyo controls the value of fym people who complain about a item are stupid its literally fake currency and the people are not complaining about us getting one for free i literally didnt see a single person say that people are rightfully complaining about how they added another feature that only helps whales whom majority of dont even need it when they could have helped reduce the effect of powercreep on light spenders and fps by making one gold ball cost e stars or a number like that that is big enough to not be too friendly and make it limited to one gold ball per monthpatch
what do you mean by playing endgame usually just login once a patch complete story try and beat endgame and then just log off idk if thats counting playing endgame like the number of attempts is in single digits
i agree with iyo point of view on the global passive its not castorices passive the problem the problem is in the future and a thing that nakes me mad is how they explained the global passive in the live they said since castorice is close to death she wants to delay its arrival what the fuck kind of logic is that if youre close to something you dont want to delay and i also agree that there are a lot of other problems with the game that i would like to see resolved for example the powercreep is there and we know so i would like to see either more rewards or the hp inflation needs to slow down this is a turnbased game you cant use skills like in another games to supply to the powercreep zz also as hp inflation and its worse than hsrs on the timeline but you dont feel it that much because you can use your skills to compensate
i think a better analogy for the golden ball is instead of crack and mcdonalds i would actually say you gave me to pay rent for but now its and i need another a free ruan mei is nice if you dont need it you can just save the ball and use it on another character when they eventually become available in the rotation but if they dont give us a reliable way to get this item free x character isnt going to cut it especially ruan mei that is universal true but much more geared towards break teams and guess what archetype hasnt gotten much attention other than dot since x began other than that yes the value of the item might be youre essencially getting a limited character but the characters that are going to be in the shop rotation arent going to be worth the same as new characters i think this is their way to still be able to sell older characters that most people will not waste pulls on a rerun again ruan mei and other harmony characters are the exception but right now x characters are starting to go on rotation we probably wont see x characters on rotation until the end of x or the beginning of x so those characters will most likely given how things have been developong depriciate a lot in value other than the harmony characters robin sunday etc i dont see many x characters being worth pulling for when you have the x hunt dps doing twice as much damage as feixiao and mind you feixiao is still pretty good its just that since she released no other single target character has and characters that are aoe such as therta reach damage numbers equal if not higher than the single target dps so what will happen when another single target releases yup feixiao will be eclipsed the golden ball is a good start if they give us every patch you can either slowly build teams or you could save them and go all in on a character you like when they go on rotation and e them although i doubt that will be possible they will probably put a limit of characters or something that you can get through this shop if they give us silver ball per patch its less good but its the same deal you can slowly build a team of you can play the long game its just that this time itll take twice as long in a game that is constantly shifting with every single patch for the golden ball to be worth anything it needs to be a resource like variable dice rare but you can get one per patch if you buy the nameless honor or one every other patch if you dont buy nameless honor do i like that model no i think it should be per patch regardless if you spend or not but this is hoyo out of all greedy options this is the one that benefits most players especially since nameless honor has been getting more and more value with the introduction of the dice and the new resin
this video makes sense to me how tf is someone leaving the game because of a shitty change bull shit everyone has a limit to the amount of schlop they will eat and the passive is a last straw seeing how accepting everyone is of this too nah were out its not a excuse speaking with you money or time
there is no harsh reality the game has had aggressive power creep for a long time now to the point you need new characters to some extent usually supports to clear the content but no one is truly a must pull not having some characters make your account worse but does not make the game unclearable unless you skip all supports the global passive idea could lead to the first true must pull characters that is a reason to quit compared to before this company gets no benefit of the doubt we have every reason to believe they will double down hard on this i agree with the title tho this is the great filtering the only people that will continue to play are those willing to deal with the bullshit and burn their wallets and when they find out just how many people they have wrapped around their fingers this will likely leak into the other games
iyo i hope you plan on checking out expedition it looks like its gonna be one of the most interactive turn based in a while
the hsr team has forgotten the number rule people pull for characters if a players favorite character becomes useless even in story mode that is it
if you quit this game what will this channel be about wuwa
castorice damn the character that got all cc wuwa glazers and hoyotards freaking the f out and bithing whining i need her gonna bring my girl home i need her and her global passives asap
we have almost all patches for events whats new now
i disagree somewhat with iyos take on the end game i play it to get jades but i only play it until i cant clear on my first attempt its not worth my time to get sweaty over those last few stars i think that most people are probably the same they only play the endgame casually which means that for them moc as and pf are just like another form of event mini game not an important part of the game just a way to get a few more jades from that perspective the endgame being of the game is a wild exaggeration because you hardly need to spend any time on it to get most of the rewards that are on offer
a cherry on top to what the game already being bad or like the final straw personally the global passive isnt what would break my camels back its so insignificant in the grand scheme of the game itself that it doesnt matter if its there or not but this is why i expressed my issues with hsr are not the same as everyone elses people feel differently about this thing thats their prerogative
yeah a cherry on top of the already bad game design throughout hsr the global passives are that cherry either way it goes i quit hsr last september because the game wasnt fun for me never even finish luofu lol the global passives just solidified me not returning
you might not have seen it but ive seen plenty of comments convos from streams at the time of recording this vid discussing that very thing there was even confusion about it in my own discord i quite literally dont give a single fuck if the item cost real world dollars or not its valued at which is what i said in the video i even used a quote directly from cinna to help further explain what the sentiment is why people treat it the way they do fps shouldnt care about something made for whales if thats what the majority believe its for again explained in the vid if i work in the it department im not gonna care about what the maintenance crew receives when it doesnt effect me however i do absolutely agree with you that they couldve done that regarding the golden ball but they didnt i cant play off of what ifs when discussing why im currently bothered by xyz
youre just not playing the game at all youre worst than me at this point if you login once a patch lol
completely understood agreed with what youre saying here that analogy wouldve been better to use too wish i wouldve thought of it during my rant haha
this video makes no sense because im assuming since you didnt explain why you came into the video to argue not to listen i clearly explained what my own issue was then i explained that exact statement youre referring to in depth that the shitty change doesnt actually change the game its been in a bad state for patches now however i get that you mightve believed the game to be in a great state only you know that i called it bs because the urge to leave shouldve already been there enforced given the countless issues weve been expressing for over half a year now im not calling someone leaving bs cause they choose to i am calling it bs if this single thing is what made me people suddenly hate the gameleave when theres xyz issues already present worse than the infamous global passive
yeah gatcha games that overpowercreep are stupid everyone has their older favourite characters you alienate them all
a lot of players want their characters to have a long term longevity especially they spend money on ithsr should follow genshins path in term of powercreep so that everyones favourite characters can be used if they get it
i play other gacha games just havent put much focus on them for the channel ill still fulfill my sponsorships obligations with hsr cause that helps pay my but ive been exploring more how do i have fun with this game instead of xyz games genshin wuwa etheria restart black beacon etc nothing is set in stone yet since im also waiting to see what happens with this hsr stuff too i did geek out over canterella though lol shes such a good character
crack analogy was wild
agree i quitted a while ago too and the global passive wasnt the main reason although global passives suck the game mechanics suck the powercreep before global passive sucks the storytelling sucks the events are boring
around the mark about nobody playing the endgame mrdookie would like to have a chat with you dont get me wrong i agree with you about the endgame stuff he says only of the hsr players plays endgame absolute bs sure there some who only play for the story but to say of the players only does the endgame he also used the prydwen sampling size pool as his proof but i saw that sampling size that sampling size doesnt tell you whether or not the accounts they scanned were dead accounts if those accs were whales goldfish or fp the best part massive reading skill issue for him cuz the way i read prydwens sampling size its around of the sampling size who does the endgame
i will prob log on but not play going to get my jades from my daily logins first i think but im just losing interest penacony part was peak for me all else has been just above average at best i mean how the heck you mess up greek and roman imagery beset by a pantheon of godlike beingsonly hojo knows but wuthering waves that game cooks but the global passive isnt bullshit youre assuming its a final reason while completely refusing to address the concerns they have about it and how this is a precent that will be abused kind of a weak take
last week they still sit on rating on google play store but now it dropped to rating now and is the lowest of all hoyoverse games with lots of reviews concerning the new predatory systems powercreep and new global passive mechanic
i dont wanna say i feel vindicated because its not really all that deep but i do find it funny that people have been having the sentiment that hsr just isnt a very good rpg the entire reason i was hyped for the game is because a gacha tbrpg sounded great but it was just so mechanically uninteresting that i ended up quitting out of sheer boredom think i quit when jingliu came out whenever that was
speedowagon
wuwa sets a new bar for what gacha rpg can be should be playing hsr afterward felt like hoyo is scamming me mydei cutscene pisses me off its so short and rushed hes a limited character and hoyo spent less effort animating his laststand battles than what kuro did for the free mcs battle
i dont know with you content creators you treat it is like the end of the world how can we be sure that you are concerned for the fp players or are you all cloutchasing what is happening to the game for your own monetary gain via views shess stupidity hoyo dont give a fuck when you content creators quit the game will continue
im not quitting right now but once the greed gets out of control with the global passive thats when im out
jokes on you guys we na servers are a minority compared to the chinese servers so hoyo isnt gonna cry for us also the life culture of easterner is almost workaholic and they will gladly spend some cash to have account development rather than spend time they dont have because of that the gacha games have the green light to make those choices
your first point isnt true because the global pass proves the game will never improve before now people held out hope the game would improve with this going through its essentially the nail in the coffin and you know other games will follow their lead remember when they said they would buff units for back in now months later saying to wait more months with no info on the buffs and its only for characters the powercreep hasnt changed they just increased hp again in the leaks sometimes you just gotta cut your losses youre yelling at a wall didnt genshin apologize for zhongli before buffing him
dude what the global passive is terrible if it comes to other games including wuthering waves i will also quit those games if they come to all of them well is what it is and have fun everyone this mechanic will destroy any challenge in the game even after the disaster the meta was for star rail before this was announced and it will do so for every other game
genshin did it with zhongli
an item that you get for free that you have to pay for more of is literally crack
just because they put a price on an item doesnt make it its actual value doesnt matter if you get some for free its not worth
i just found you today and this is a really unique outlook from the typical one definitely worth listening and im looking forward to your future videos
i was a dolphin and didnt think twice to quit the moment i couldnt skip the penacony banana garbage story it drained all the fun i had for the game looking at the direction the game is going i made the right decision
looking for a reason to quit assumption
the value of the gold ball isnt its its a digital currency there is zero scarcity the only reason its worth is because hoyo says it is they could change their mind and give one out for free if they wanted to then it would be worth less but they wont do that because people will spend on a worthless digital currency
it was the first thing on my mind lol
the story telling improved in though are you still stuck in that sentiment just because
williamsl story was a snooze all the way for me
i did too the game started to feel aimless the story that grabbed me was getting ignored though i came back for firefly since at least stalleron hunters were getting traction but feels like a very poorly done spinoff lol
alexfrank acheron almost made me come back because of just how insanely cool her ult anim is but it took me all about seconds to remember that a i quit after using all my pulls so id have to do eventsgrind and b id just uninstall again the moment the novelty of the new character wore off
did you even watch the video
na isnt just a minority to cn its most likely a massive minority to the entire world i say most likely because the bar chart i saw was for genshin not honkai but i see no reason to think honkai is different usa didnt even make the chart which showed the top countries lol
hoyo fixing zhongli came from a time when hoyo were run by people who care about games hoyo today is a bloodsucking enterprise
alexfrank or it could be because cn was upset so change comes lol
buffing units isnt something that happens over night just because you want it too even less so when its likely they never planned to do so unit the players complained about it so these games are planned months in advance so theyre not going to move because people like you want them to jump when you order them too they said buffing older units was coming so its coming even if they pushed it down a ways cause they had other things to do i get it youre entitled to your buffs but theres a system to how these things work and they dont need to drop everything cause you want something right nao
michaelpowers thats literally how it works zz and gi proves that so youre just making up excuses
hoyo fixing zhong li was due to them not being multibillon dollar company as yet and still being dependent on the playerbase
shonenhikada what are you talking about they made a billion their first months lmao
alexfrank they literally only buffed zhongli because chinese players were upset by the fact that the god of the land representing china was not the strongest character in the game mind you hoyo makes most of their genshin billions from the chinese server so they had to bend the knee to stay alive
crowing this cn doesnt care much about the passive obviously some people do but not nearly as much over here other parts of asia will also get listened too but not as much and since they spend way more theyre going to follow their lead thats why nuev and zhongli both had their issues promptly fixed
johndoesieg yea i didnt know cn didnt actually care much for the passive all hope was lost of them removing it after i found that out
crowing your living in a fantasybut keep thinking life revolves around you lol
crowing they did not nicd try though mihoyo shill when zhong li was released mihoyo made millions but they hadnt reach billion dollar company as yet
sure
mind boggling that they have actually good idea like rappa fire song for rappa then they call rappa delusional and while the real world lore is dr banana and greekplanet
bruh i could not continue the story quest and deleted the game it was way too bad
yeah the story is over convoluted unnecessary long and it doesnt help the fact that every patch put my main char into the f tier every patch i am pressured to pull bc you know no amount of gamer instinct or reflexes i have would save me when the boss one shot me during his turn
you play a gacha and make this type of discourse
lol kirigayahayato
its the same thing with primogemsjades or what have you they dont exist hoyo just put a price on these nonexistent things and we go with it
everything is only worth what people agree its worth gold is worthless its just pretty metal but we all agree it is has value so it has value
gold is worthless its just pretty metal but we all agree it is has value so it has value says alot about education and the lack of it
uninstalled during i was putting less and less effort into the game i was using acherons technique as much as possible to onehit kill every enemy on the map i was using automod all the time even in the endgame what kept me going was the lore but towards the end of penacony with the fireworks then hoolay and feixiaos story not to mention fugue who comes and goes and thats it i was already disgusted with the game but i held on hoping for a good lore with i did it imo it was even worse both the storytelling and the lore i stopped and told myself id wait until the end of x to come back and the global passive arrived no im out im still playing zz because i love the game but im so scared for its future
now that castorices global passive is confirmed im commenting based on this current character i just failed to see how broken her global passive is it might be helpful towards the newer players who dont have much characters built but im thinking of the experience with bailu at best getting revived just to immediately get wiped next the next enemy action for players who are more than ready to take on the endgame this global passive makes no difference how often do you have characters dying in fights especially when you have competent sustains like aventurine and lingsha once in a very while maybe for me im skipping her even when i had prefarmed for her because im making my ongoing upgrade towards acherons e my priority even assuming i still have enough resources after achieving that fugue is next in line castorice gonna have to wait no way im changing my fp status for fomo the biggest problem in hsr isnt this global passive at the moment but the pathetic amount of content thats released in every patch even major patches now im getting new characters just to pass the rite of maturity thats the endgame then what return to being a farmer for majority of the time is that fun im still hanging on all these while because of acherons upgrade its like that annoying checkbox i cant wait to cross off in my bucket list to me lol this coming rerun is the final phase once done i think its gg for me time to leave hsr
regarding thumbnail yes its either quit or submit and yes idgaf ill just go with the flow coz i didnt spend on this game haha
i uninstalled when v came out and it was obvious it was here to stay the fact that theres supposedly more globals in the can for other units down the road i just cant thats as someone whos wasted upwards of digits on this game i know i cant trust a game like this youre not wrong outside of the fei xiao segmetn of the story which was sandwhiched between two turds i havent had fun with the game since and even in the story drug on in segments and felt like a slog to get through and i needed a reason to get out especially since ive dumped way to much money into the game and this is an easy thing to make me go youre whale and its only going to get worse from here so i dived out
crack and mcdonalds crazy
gacha players acting like this decision will rain meteors down on earth killing us all
heres my thought process sure yeah quit but at least leave feedback that hey im leaving your game because of the passive and xyz but if ppl leave but dont give feedback there wont be any fixes so the game will be as it is thats like complaining about the shit the government does on social media but not reaching out to the people that could make a difference so nothing changes
the moment the global pasive was official the game died to me there is no chance to go back and enjoy the way felt playing every character i dont want to win by paying for the latest character with time or money it was nice while it lasted
i dont play hsr but what gets me is people including zz into this when literally zz hasnt done anything besides being under the hoyo banner and just uninstalling assuming zz is automatically going to follow the same path if or when zz does follow this same path then by all means but just judging zz based on its older siblings without giving it a chance to prove itself is ridiculous and so far imo zz has been doing everything right its just crazy how various content creators that were praising zz immediately did a after this global passive situation
they just need to make the future global passive just like cassies convenient if you have it doesnt matter if you dont if they started making global passives which makes a team go from cycle the moc to fucking cycle yea man thats wrap up because it will only esclate from then only lets see where future of hsr goes im fp with not much problems clearing game and having fun so yea ill stay for a while great video btw
this is why i moved to nikke dont got to worry about any of this
yeah youre right ill keep playing but youre right i just want to play the game because i enjoy it regardless of the questionable choices
my prediction is that global passives are a way for them to make new char more enticing as hoyo is self aware that their story or marketing is not good enough for people to pull with just that and they are also buffing previous so to make a distinction between new and old i want to add that if you are playing hsr for endgame then just quit the game its better for you
you actually get castorice for free if you save stellar jades for months thats what fp have to do you can call this some kind of grind
i was a whale like i used to spend per patch but recently the story got way worse boring bloated dialog the hp inflation and powercreep i was already tired and exhausted trying to login and play this global passive was just too much with all the other issues that needed fixing i tried giving them time to improve and fix things but i had to stop lying to myself and living in a dream hoyo has no intention of improving hsr or making changes that i actually care about so anyway im cutting ties with hsr unsubbed from their youtube and twitter i have to move on
i think this is the first video i see with a real argument against the bad practices of hsr and not only only focusing in the global passive its refreshing to hear that after listening to so many creators only focusing in the stupid global passive anyways average iyo w
going to be real while i agree with just about everything in the vid i think people should realize that kuro games is the exception when it comes to just about of gacha companies because you have this set of people that are jaded and realize this isnt something that can really be changed because to change it would mean to change how pretty much all gacha operate as in a complete overhaul hoyo is actually not only the standard as far as incentives in gacha but the model is actually rather tame compared to most gacha before genshincovid days and so a majority of those people that have played gacha before genshin will not even see global passives as a real issue and are at least smart enough to wait till it becomes an actual issue and besides the game is still enjoyable to them before the update like you said ppl were just going into the livestream when they were alrdy set on quitting and wanted an excuse
its insane how many hoyo bootlickers exist in the comments or on discords and other groups people arent even willing to entertain the slippery slope this opens up not just for hoyo games but every other gatcha game out there run to wuwa but if hoyo doesnt get any push back kuro is gonna do the same shit ive never been quite as disappointed in a subgroup of gamers than the hsr community
fp are on life support because i am one of them there a famine in the game i hated so much but i just capped playing the still help
im ok with this because its probably something related to the story but the moment they announce another gp im out doesnt matter if it will be deactivated in the endgame or if its inoffensive global passives are eos this is the only time ill give them a pass
more global passive characters coming in just the x arc phainon and fate colab characters so if you hate fate or dont want a ludonarritve dissonance break wellinsert hoyo telling you to shove off will be hp basic atk skill spd crcd undefined reliable leaks from the ones showing of castorices
sombrerogato ok sure spd an entire spd boot as a passive lol did the free ayaka from genshin tell you that
maximumcarnage hey man im just repeating what the leak said that also had the accurate castorice info dont call me crazy call the leak sus if you want
also leave a negative review on the game and google classroom
you deadass
yeah i mean it is what it is genshin came out then after it gained traction started treating players like crap star rail gained traction and are now starting to treat players like crap zz is the youngest not even years old soi think people understand the pattern here it isnt fair to those specific devs for zz you right but at the same time it is what it is i cant fault them if they are tired of this cycle with this company
godofgoblins yeah i get that its just frustrates me if zz wasnt a hoyo title it would immediately be looked at differently im just really hoping zz becomes the exception to break this cycle
gomeljak same i dont even play zz but i hope for the best
godofgoblins its not like its hard to fix the game they could have done it years ago and then just focused on updates instead of having to pretend that the players dont play the game they spent more time lying and doing stupid shit than it would have taken to fix the game
gomeljak hi is also an exception in this case devs actually care about the state of their game like zz
an issue is they could absolutely make it matter which is what people are dreading if hoyo assumes a lot of players pull castorice they logically will want the players to see that value right ok time to jack up the damage of enemies and nuke you think they wont they jacked hp like crazy for a long time now that is what people are suspecting or dreading and there is no shot they release globals on stars that are meh or worthless but time will tell we gotta wait and see im just not holding my breathe because well its hoyo the star rail team has done some great things yes but unless these people are absolute generous saints i think many peoples suspicions will soon come to fruition
powercreep doesnt have to be limited to enemy hp it can also be enemy damage imagine a boss that can ignore shield and shot your dps unless the dps is hpscaling or you have cassie passive
endgame is still getting cleared easily by fps who know how to play the game and dont just auto and prayoh and actually farm relics and lvl traces to max lol
flare lol endgame in hsr is first a char check and then skill check and all the people u are talking about clearing content are those who have giga invested relics insane stats and had to reset times for that perfect rng all those e seele clears you see takes a fuck ton of retries and resetting the game times is not fun and i know i cannot convice you neither can you so lets stop now
i expected them to finally buff bailu with cleanse
they new bosses have shot mechanics and hp depleted
crowing you can just bring healer against the new boss like gallachad luocha and others
id check it out in like months to see if it got better personally i range from to dolphinwhale territory depending on my satisfaction with the story so there are characters in fgo which basically has no pity that i will hardcore whale for and max out but so far hsr hasnt really gotten to the same point personally i think they need to work a lot more on the story and other gameplay modes than endgame dont get me wrong that needs a fix too but my impression is that people wont care about that as much if everything else is good
story is bad for you when everyone is saying its good
oh shut up kuros just taking the path of least resistance theyre also out for your pockets just as much as the others
grayewicked kuro makes much less money but spends it on creating actual battle sequence look at patch quality kuro takes our money to create something amazing what has hsr been doing with our money for that reason id rather give my money to kuro
alexfrank less or more money is money regardless methods and intentions may differ but the objectives stay the same
theres a difference between bootlickers and people who just dont care im seeing a lot of i dont care and not a lot of bootlicking personally im gonna keep playing because this really doesnt affect me i play for fun not for the meta or any of that stuff just because someone may not see this as terrible as you see it doesnt mean its bootlicking
viktoryc very true in fact even gachasmack agreed with this on twitter saying to not impose ideals on anyone else if someone enjoys a video game respect it cool so that is to each there own however when someone makes valid and fair criticisms and someone replies they are having fun and dont care ok just be quiet bruh we out here trying to make the game you enjoy you so much objectively better you dont care neat enjoy and let others do there thing
viktoryc communism affected many people who did not care they were herded into the same cattle cars as the true believers
oh look its the same ole bootlicker comment eyeroll i always love the people who name call and denigrate others gachasmack comes to mind when they dont agree with you its also a great way to never get them to listen to you
michaelpowers funny enough gacha on twitter literally said to never push someones ideals on others in regards to this he acknowledged that if anyone enjoys a game respect that kinda odd you thought of him though
viktoryc the problem is that you will complain about how global passives that increase crit and ignore resistance or defence ruined the game in the future
thegamerfe thats why we as the players need to keep giving them feedbacks in order for them to not go into that route if you only complain but never actually giving the feedbacks to hoyoverse directly then what is the point
im not impressed by someone who says one thing in their video then another later on so backtracked big deal
have you considered the fact thats only a possibility i know it could very well be the case but ill be honest these global passives seem more like features that straight up stat buffs a good example someone used in another comment is when you think about riding a bike and how theres a possibility you might fall off and get hurt do you just choose not to ride at all thats what is happening in this case for me until they show they are choosing that route i have no problem with the global passive and if or when it comes to that point i honestly have no problem in pushing back against hoyo or just leaving imo global passives are fine as long as they are done right
williamsl what good is feedback if theyre not gonna listen whats the point just quit the game simple
sittingcrowd then quit by your own i love hsr and i wanted it to improve to be better
williamsl we all want the game to improve the problem is the devs are too complacent until we get cn to complain they really dont care what us westerners say
sittingcrowd didnt they improved the story in im sure its not only because of cn players feedbacks so i had hope with keep sending them feedbacks about potential backlashes that global passives will bring would made them also rethink their decision
truewell if players love a game who is on a downhill path then lets have there waylet them enjoy their final months or few year of the game
williamsl difference in opinions but what even improved in more still images and forcing characters stories into one story isnt really an improvement
sittingcrowd they only using black screens when its necessary more still images is actually fine than black screens they were using horrorlike storytelling during that tribbie nightmare scene the camera angles and characters expressions improved the comedy and chemistry between phainon and mydei is not forced and felt more natural than more action packed cutscenes less puzzles during story and characters stories into a story is actually fine as long as it still relevant to the lore like with understanding mydei we can see with succeeding nikadors coreflame means he must also succeeding his role as vanguard of amphoreus against the black tide for eternity for tribbie we know that even if she know that she would scattered into a thosand pieces and died eventually she is still doing so for the sake of amphoreus future it also noting that they only promised to do improvement of the story in but they really fixed the storytelling in advance
i guess its just a difference in opinions then because theres still a lack of things that the story telling desperately needs and we just didnt get any of that in we still have characters standing around and talking with no expressions on their faces spamming the same poses over and over the dialogue bloat is still one of the biggest issues as they like to make a simple plot unnecessary convoluted just to give the narrative a deeper meaning and the trailblazers still have done nothing in the story while we keep getting force shipped with the new main waifu in the region but maybe most of this will be solved in hopefully
sittingcrowd no they dont forced the ship between cas and trailblazer unlike firefly castorice is only happy to see trailblazer seemed fine when they touch her during flame reaver first encounter because anyone that touch her will surely die instead of romantic chemistry its more like friendship between them and it felt more natural might develop into something more but lets see
shes looking like a firefly especially if you see leaks both drain their hp both want to be a normal girl both are cursed in a sense that they cant always interact with people both created major controversy within the community both have a close relationship with trailblazer and use them in their bis team both have insectsbug motifs firefly and butterfly both have deadly abilities but come across as sweet and innocent both are used by people for their incredibly abilities etc i could go on but its hard not to see her as just another firefly they definitely are setting her up to be the new girlfriend that everyone simps for
sittingcrowd probably
leakers already confirmed more passives
hadougun oh yeah dont worry my free ayaka is uninstalling the hsr for me
the only way they can fix the global buff is not let it stack atleast buff should be max
it doesnt matter if its a disgrace to turn based no whats even more of a disgrace games like wuwa and zz are a disgrace to action combat ill play hsr over those games any day
yeah pretty much i come back do the story play a week or two to grind jades for character if i get em another week to get useful then just only log on for dusu endgame and wait until next patch thats why the passive doesnt really bother me i barely play to begin with
i feel like they added the passive on to her cz they just wanted to experiment with it test the waters if ya will simple as that as for my own opinion on it this is ganna be a hot take probably but i dont really care ive seen other gachas have similar buffs and its been fine there feh azur lane and nikke being examples i get that people are scared of the potential it can bring for other passives in the future but thats just it potential theres also potential that you go ride a bike you fall off and break your leg does that mean you should never ride a bike just because that can happen no you just keep on rolling stressing out of something thats only a possibility is not fun and not healthy so im not ganna and im just ganna continue enjoying the game like i have been for almost years now
ill be whaling for the animated in game card
its just a game
it could have been such an easy fix to just tell the player base we read your feedback and changed the global passive talent for casotrice instead she will revive characters maybe multiple since bailu already revives one character herself while on the same team as said characters or hell just get rid of it being a global thing and change the talents effect to something else then so its not copying bailu they have seen the huge divide from this and of course they dont give a fuck once this harmless passive is passed it opens the expectation of future passives being released that will only become worse with time
iyo ive previously oneguyed you before on some of your past hsr takes i stopped watching your content after you made the wuthering waves needs a me video i came back to this vid because i am gauging all the ccs stance on the passive today i have gained newfound respect for you you spoke nothing except facts here happy to hear that youve quit the game as well i am a hsr player who has spent kk on the game i have been incredibly dissatisfied with it for a while and have quit after the castorice announcement i can confidently say they are going to lose a lot of dolphin level players like me who are tired of constantly pulling new units just for a fun gameplay experience im afraid that wont be enough though
your take makes perfect sense but this is a live service game people were waiting for the live service game to get better global passives were the harsh truth that itll get worse instead
my respect for you went up ten foldi think you just admitted a truth that even haters dont even admit gachasmack pretended to like hsr and is now using this as an excuse to quit out of all of the rpgs ive played in my life hsr has always been on the lower end of the spectrum do i like hsr yes because it gives me something to do after work and its easy to play but as an rpg its just mid but its a good gacha game its opposite with genshin impact i think genshin is a great open world rpg but its a terrible gacha game
the perception of a games health is actually extremely important to the company if a game is perceived to be dying whether or not it actually is becomes a self fulfilling prophecy for casual and hardcore players alike whales require minnows to survive if theres no casual playerbase to flex against even whales will stop spending very quickly
ngl a guard option in hsr like fgo would be so good or a different type of defensive function for specific paths guard for preservation destruction erudition rememberance evasion would be nihility abundance hunt harmony those changes using consumables in endgame would do a lot for the game tldr i agree wh you lol
i still maintain that the global passive was originally a simple coding error and the massive amount of talk it generated made it real
im from the future and the global cas revive is another firefly is busted forever
agree with the whole video and people who feel they need to quit are completely valid after all this and with the game has been headed beforehand although on the flip side i wish some of those people wouldnt put down others who still enjoy the game global passive or not i feel like its okay to still enjoy the game if you do and not get hate for it overall though this situation is messy and although i personally wont quit until after the fate collab i hope the game does get better for the dedicated players
i would like to say something i dont care am pulling
shoutout to topaz
people are using the passive as reassurance to quit something they already werent enjoying but in turn trying to make anyone who stays out to be lesser than them for doing so they also are using the excuse that it has to be a statement made by the whole community and not a portion when thats just not the case if a majority of players dont pull castorice im sure theyll see they lost money and wont do it again given how greedy they are the issue is making not pulling castorice the final nail that will causes the game to be fixed
its just horse armor its just skins its just loot boxes its just battlepasses its just for c furina
there is a time and place to know when to quit dont let having spent time and money on this make you feel like u have a duty to stay with the game ok so why right like why do some people quit even though they can just ignore and have fun with the game yep sure u can do that but if the game you are playing keeps just not really doing stuff and stagnating or introducing enemies that greatly incentivizes u to pay up to win imagine right u pulled e castorice surely no way she feels terrible year later im sure enemies will still be bearable by then i love the game thats why i want the best for it but its hard when u have a lot of players just content with mediocre remedies that wont even last patches later yea mb for yapping tldr if u have something in the game u like make sure that that will be improved upon and dont settle for less
good for you and what is a good action combat game for you just for fun
wetsquirrel this is a fake social media account you are talking to my guy mihoyo employs millions of these to spread propaganda promote people to spend and slander their competitors
u absolute creature i wish u luck on ur pulls
thank you im excited
i have seen cn reviews and them most of really dont give a fk so yea thinking it will get removed in future is just not possible plus they made whole ui for just to use global passive i doubt it
hollowgunner chinese players have no standards mhy being one of the biggest chinese companies shows how china treats anyone not chinese hard to believe people keep trying to trust china when they shortchange everyone
nope they cant do that once something goes live they cant nerf it and weve long since passed the balancing stage so its too late now
he didnt quit the game
piscye he hasnt been playing and he is waiting for hoyo to fix them he isnt playing the game lol
kenpicaro i dont have any way to spend thousands on the game but i did spend a considerable amount and decided to quit too iyo is spot on about the game in general moving in the wrong direction for a while now if i cannot use the characters i like in a game that is almost entirely about combat then what is the point
k dollars is a dolphin nowadays d thats just how out of touch many gacha players seem to be other than that i respect your decision i have a lot of issues with hsr aswell but i guess i will wait for the buffs in however this game for a while now wont get any money from me
kenpicaro he pseudo quit as in he comes in and out mostly to do character guides and other associated things just check out previous videos lol and then quits again so he just doesnt actively plays the game but still makes content about it
tony i dont know the exact definition maybe im wrong on that part but i have seen people who have spent half of what i have call themselves dolphins so i went with it if i am not a dolphin thats fine it doesnt change the fact that ive spent k in the game
kenpicaro i didnt want to make fun of you dont get that wrong but i feel like people in the gacha community are kinda out of touch what a reasonable amount of money is too spend on a game most of people that call themselves gamers and play a lot of games for years probably did not spend k dollars on all their games in total consider what amount of money a company like larian studios got before they developed divinity and baldurs gate and those games are so much better and complex with the money people spend on gacha it should be easy for hoyo to add a skip button add more game modes add more cut scenes and so on although i think its fine people spending money on a game since its their hobby just compare what you can get with that money some years ago i traveled the world with euros with destinations with the likes of japan australia united states etc i didnot live in luxury hotel obviously but it was life changing adventure i will look still look back at it years if it comes too me and i myself also spend more than enough money on games everything above dollars is already pretty much
tony actually i thought you said the exact opposite i thought what you meant was imagine calling yourself a dolphin when youve only spent k on gacha my bad bro youre good i agree even is already a lot also i do own a lot of games for my xbox and ps a lot of them were on sale when i got them the actual value of those combined would also be probably the same scary when you think about it
milmil hope he sees and understands this
a field with only a few giant trees is not a forest despite what anyone says
genshin has been called a dying game for years and hoyo did nothing
its nowhere near dying shadowfaye
theoretically this is true but practically it isnt becoz every single game that has been running a few years or more will be called dead by community or the interneti have been playing many old games for years for gacha games like granblue fgo mihoyo games to pvp games like lol apex r and all games after released a few years there will be so many ppl in the community internet constantly claiming them to be dead while they have been running fine for years
fp players are really important for playerbase countif a lot of fp and casual players quit it will give a bad reputation to the companywhales are for the company profits and fp players are to give a good reputation to the company whether the company are friendly consumer or not
maybe thatll be phainons global passive
i mean it aint wrong
firefly still is though
she still is if the enemies enemy calls for a fire dps theres no good fire dps at the moment so thatll change when another fire dps comes out
firefly is shadownerfed by increasing enemy hp its offense powercreep castorice is a defensepowercreep they can keep increasing enemy damage enemy does special power attack that ignore aventurine shield and shot your dps unless you have castorice passive p
theyre enablers of the abuse complicit
rip my topaz after cipher comes out
its just a game
it only gets worse this only sets the stage for whats to come
its just a league skin
blacknight when youre not youll realize how dumb this argument is
a lot of hsr characters require e s to function
the issue is no ones forcing you to commit to these purchases
grayewicked so that means any game can be as pw as possible because youre not partaking in them
dannympdq youre acting as if you cant actively resist whatever life throws at you pathetic defeatist mentality
hadougun thats a bold claim
why is bro bringing furina in this c shes still top in the game
blacknight and is not a lot of money is it
hoanganhvuong and who made that choice
blacknight def not me but those under might and before you said anything about parents fault for not control their kid spending on a gacha game because they are kids are you able to control them not watch porn or slasher movies at all there are regulations banning them from watching those pg and guess what the age rating for hsr is its kids are allow to play these games thats the problem and global passive only makes it worse
i wasnt going to say that cus i agree on that as someone whos been playing games for almost years and have lived a childhood of my own so yes im aware kids can do things behind parents back however what the parents can control is them having access to their bank account
notice how none of the things you mention have any impact on your enjoyment of a game except maybe battle passes keeping you playing which usually come with a free track anyway
welcome to gatcha games its been like this since
dannympdq pay to win what are you winning
not a fp but gonna defend them a bit here a fp players is a pw player waiting to happen gacha games are predatory because they try every trick in the book to get the conversion from fp to pw oh the content is time consuming well you can pay to finish faster oh you want both characters this patch well if you pay you can get them ah you lost the well pay more the whole fp dont matter to a company is not completely true fp players being able to clear all content is good advertisement for new players to come in the new players get hit by fomo or time wasting and potentially become whales if you spend once youre likely to spend again and especially hoyo is going above and beyond to get you to spend once yes a whale brings in the revenue but that is not the whole picture also free characters are great but getting a character that everybody told you to get and has a power crept bis team is not great the other character is one that is power crept and everybody told you to skip feels really bad
casterice global passive had to much glue
atleast the other companies know how much the player hate it so surely they wont implement global passives on their games right
i believe there is a road for hsr to become better but thats up to the devs to go down that road
i think ive been slowly falling out of love with the game since penacony and its primarily because of the storytelling and a lot of other stuff ive not been struggling much with endgame content but i will say at least with moc that it did feel a bit more difficult to get the clears i was looking for than it did before didnt care much for amphoreus at least at the start but i felt like the storytelling with this most recent update was improving again and while the global passive isnt exactly the nail in the coffin for me it sucks that it feels like they improve in way and then announce how they plan to fuck up harder somewhere else in the future and it feels like its all happening so fast
iyo man i have watched you since the beginning of hsr i am on the side that as long as i am having fun playing the game that is all that matters to me i am sorry that sounds bad but that is my time my money and my fun take care man i am going to unsub there are no other games that you play that i follow take care and thanks for all the fish
i have exemples in genshin impact the buffs to one of the shielders that was weak on release neuvillette bug fix they apologize and gave gem if i remember correctly i do agree on somethings with you about the passive the question is indeed why why the passive is global why are you doing this why now etc about the fp vs pw companies in general will turn to those who benefits them fp dont matter cause they are players yes but not those who make the companys benefice i dont mean it like fp are shit just trying to be as factual as possible personnaly i dont care about the passive in itself the thing is indeed it could lead to something disastrous as it could lead to nothing or something else i am in a state of wait and see i think its too early to put a hard verdict right now maybe i am coping and what i say will age like milk maybe not and time will tell if i was right or wrong either way they wanted this passive to be implemented it is submit or die mydei is that you for now im happy with the game i still have my fun i still like the story i like the endgame want more but i like it the way it is i like it however something important i want to say dont play a game you dont find fun in there is thousands of other games for you to enjoy waiting for you to play them
hard for me to even log in ive found and played other games that have my interest and im having fun with wuwa gfl rev sadly it doesnt bother me either day player havent decided if its worth my time or even if i have fun playing it anymore
crazy that the only taunt character is fmc after that i thought we would be introduced to more mechanics such as the ones iyo mentioned but it just seems like you attack i attack in different forms but essentially its all the same thing
your videos are incoherent lmao really should try to script a little more
the global passive release was confirmation that hoyo only care about profit and have interest in creating and cultivating a good game each game is a pump and dump sell the speculation of what the game could be and milk everyone dry then repeat the cycle
dawg were def getting a revived hoolay pro max thatll one shot everyone
we need more global passives
iyo spamming uploads ayo
or take the third option ignore and play the game your way lol
well maybe play limbus company then
they wanted there decision of quitting to be validated by other people so they feel less bad about the wasted time or money put into the game
perma fp players dont matter but the fp experience does because thats how the vast majority of players are going to be introduced to your game
i am fp all the time for any games i played
fp matters tho because they are the players base of the game most of the players are fp if the players base is low no will spend money on the game which they think doesnt have a player base simple logic why do they give free characters for fp players who else
dev will change it if they losing profit from china players otherwise no shot
appreciate that man and you know what your time money and fun are yours to use how you see fit more power to ya big dawg
genshin gave out for it
jamesdavid oh ok mb then i had a doubt thanks m
paradox no problem
preach wish players who are quitting or have already wouldnt put down those who still enjoy the game though the amount of people ive seen trying to morally grandstand by putting down players who want to pull for castorice is ridiculous
you can see how neuvillette affected astra with her new hollow zero attack form you can hardly even aim her beam its crazy bad
i also still havent quit the game because its still not as bad now but i bet that they will monetize this global passive aggressively in the future along with more powercreep and restrictive characters and lcs i dont mind if people play and have fun with the game but at least they acknowledge the blatant monetization and accept others criticisms if you still enjoy it then play it and if you dont quit i can understand both sides if they are being reasonable lets not attack each other
yunli has it with ult mydei has it with ult also
quizzer fair enough but my point was having more mechanics like guard similar to argenti boss or traffic robot chances of missed attacks hide only more has this atm etc etc so you kinda missed the point and only commented to be correct
yassassintm for a turn based game im disappointed hsr doesnt have an evademiss attack chance mechanic for charactersenemies itll be annoying as hell with enemies but imagine running a sustainless dps just because they can evade attacks lmao
oyogitsune unfortunate thing they had considered a dodge mechanic in the past
boothill taunts
u trippin my tingyun taunts better than mc
donkeynq tingyun aggro goes even beyond the game itself did you ever wonder where the shots go in other games when enemies miss to tingyun
yassassintm more rng on the game would probably not be welcomed by many if they balance the game around those extra rng checks
oyogitsune nah then what reason would be to pull sustains for however a dodge mechanics would be really cool on a preservation unit
i literally said its not gonna be edited im just gonna talk lol im not scripting out brain thoughts
theyre an incredibly abusive company to its playerbase predatory abusive
most of their profit are from china players what do you expected
sweeleongng incorrect japan spends more than china in almost all of their games
pablorodriguezreal in total china wins all day everyday thats why they only care for chinas opinion for buffs and stuff the amount of value china gives them also being their home market is nuts japanese spend lots ofc but not more than china
not just profits short term profits at the expense of long term sustainability no competent gacha developer wouldve let a feature like weakness implant pass beta because it breaks one of the fundamental principals of gacha design like seriously the damage type system present in basically every gacha game with a combat system doesnt exist for the players benefit it exists so that the developers can sell you more characters creating a character that bypasses the element types is just stealing from your own future profits
nickjordan its like what josh hayes said when he reviewed genshin yes the monetisation isnt in your face fp viability is a thing but its the most carefully crafted manipulative version of monetisation and it ends up getting allot more money in the long run all this does is compounds the issue they created
why they already have characters that do this with them in the team would you say the game is impossible to beat without them in it now
short term profits is a crazy statement hi is still running barely profitingif at all genshin still rakes in a good amount years in hsr is still only a little behind genshin zz is the one with the best qol and effort put in yet its sadly seems to be the one lagging behind a bit if theres one thing about hoyos games its longevity the only pumpndump schemes that are somewhat valid are anni patches as they seem to lock power spikes behind c for the new units hsrs spending event is disgusting though cause they could have easily made it tied to stellar jades like hi so fp and those who saved up are rewarded too
noo we arent and your dooming if you think we will
zoeila erm that was only a joke
nah i just needed them to drop in the same day cause i yap a lot lol
so basically the second option
soo the nd option
bro thought he was cooking by just saying the second option but different
amari youre actually dumb as a box of rocks playing however you want isnt submitting to the company youre just a dunce and im fp and hoyoverse games only get minutes a day from me lol
reverse feels like the best alternative tbh
i finally started playing limbus company and the story is better than expected even better than the garbage hsr is putting out now and less annoying ta on its characters lol
yeah one reason i stay fp on most gacha is if i leave i lose nothing but the time i spent on a game and i can always come back
u can also say this they wanted their decision to stay to be validated by other people so they feel like the time and money they spent on the game was worth it there is a time and place to know when to quit dont let having spent time and money on this make you feel like u have a duty to stay with the game
chipsilnight your response has nothing to do about waht i said besides your ego i was giving a reason why people are leaving with others in response to what iyo what talking about you came to yap about leaving
or they hoped that you know the anniversary patch might be the start of a turnaround for the shoddy state of the game and that the leaks of the global passive would be bs but it wasnt so was the straw that broke the camels back
pandoras box is not that bad what the greek gods says
lets goo gotcha whales only club monetization mechanics alright everyone all togetherbaarrff
its funny how e fu xuan isnt brought up especially now that it is very attainable
saying new people wont have castorice at all in what logic wouldnt they do i mean srsly did u forget all old events can be farmed sht tons of jade so atleast they would get copy yeah sure u might say also they wont be able to farm and lvl them up but well they will becouse some patches ago they added that even if u not unlocked the zone with story u will have access to farm those mats so yeah just pointing that out
they will play alot reroll who cares about flexibility if thats what they want
hp revive is no big deal honestly so i dont see what all the fuss is about
e
why does bro sounded like hes beating it
being honest here i am on the side of tectone here i believe this system could have been better implemented and sucks that hoyo decided to choose the most greedy fuckin route possible i made the video to provide hope for players who are actively being so doom and gloom on the topic the video is a ton of coping if im being real with you all you would have definietly realized if he had finished the video anyway thanks for the reaction and i hope you all have a good rest of your days
what people dont get or deliberately not getting about the whole castorice thing isnt her global passive but its the precendence of her having a global passive for the future of the game lmao just wait until we get a global passive that provides increased crit ratedmg to your units or smth
the problem with how this issue is being addressed in twofold both on the company and the community on one hand the company is pushing out the global passive attached to pulling castorice rather than gaining it by completing her story which would make far more sense in lore and gameplaywise which is a scummy move on their part however the reaction from the community is vastly overblown and instead of just protesting by using their voices and their wallets the players who are protesting are also villainizing a vast number of other players who dont have a problem with it and want to pull castorice and play the game for their own personal enjoyment the issue is coming in where even as someone who doesnt like the implementation of the global passive ive completely switched sides to not caring anymore because the loudest voices that are calling for its removal are also claiming some insane moral highground over a gacha game an innately predatory genre built on the foundation of spending money for power if you want to protest predatory business practices then i have news for you quit gacha games altogether everyone who is standing on their high horse and calling out the global passive but still playing other gacha games is by definition a hypocrite because every gacha game is designed to entice you to spend money in the same capacity dont throw stones from glass houses it makes you look like a moron worst of all hsr is a single player game where you can get of the rewards in the endgame modes just by having two brain cells to rub together and spending the free currency you get and that isnt even the bulk of the currency youll earn the majority of the currency earned in the game is just by playing free to play those last stars in moc are only worth gems and it would literally take you a year and a half to garner enough gems from clearing or to get to even a single pity thats how little it truly matters theres no pvp and absolutely no content in the game that would pit your teams against someone elses so having global passives or not will not make you account worse in comparison unless you are comparing it yourself which isnt an issue the game is creating its an issue you are creating for yourself listen global passive or not its a goddamn game that people are playing for fun if you arent having fun for the love of god just take a break from the game or quit altogether dont make it everyone elses problem especially people who are still having fun with the game and do not act like youre somehow morally superior for having done so if youre jumping ship to play another goddamn gacha game
this helped no need hope further
i just want to say that new players will be able to get castorice because they can farm alot of jades from the story and permanent content
bro need an inhaler or something
this would be jenezad in another universe with special needs
since they cant defend this bs they wanna drag others along with it like cantarellas swimming mechanics its absolutely insane
lets be real aint no way a multibillion dollar company doesnt have a guy or team that dev check this without thinking aint this a stupid or retarted way of implementing it
yall dragging this to insane lengths now lol
i love how his counter argument is to bring bailu into the picture brah baliu could revive times in a battle and shed still be bad baliu isnt bad cause she cant revive more baliu is bad cause our sustains now are also partly harmony characters and she provides either buffs or very little buffs as well no cleanse or giving effect res hope this helps
i have not heard anyone else talk about it but pulling castorice incentives you to not actually build or use the unit at all which is stupid if you run castorice in your main team you get to have a man squad if you run a team with out her now you get a man squad technically since you now have a extra passive revived it seems like to get a maximum value from the unit you just dont want to even run them because i get to run a entire extra unit now such a stupid unit to add to the game also them giving you free supports is great and all for new players and getting a castorice when you start the game is also cool but now if you decide to get into the game after this patch you will be at a infinitely worse starting point then anyone else why would you even start playing at that point
imagine crying over cantrella swimming when you have free wings to fly on and the fact they actually hinting giving us new traversal tech in huanglong funny
cant believe people are actually loosing their absolute shit over a mid passive like acherons technique is much more op than this revives you once per battle ye pixel hp bruh people need to touch grass like srsly
hope this helps corinna gave tec a new outro phrase
dude literally sounds like a mouthbreather too you cant make this up
disability dis ability
i built bailu but the reason is because i dont have any other healers
i feel like ppl are forgetting castorices passive is global meaning u dont even have to run healers and just yolo incase u do run a healer u can even run natasha since that passive will carry all old units
yeah because this guy sucks at speaking lol
theres ways to do global passives and theres ways not to the way hsr did it is horrendous made worse by the fact that hsr has terrible balancing when it comes to power creep
the other problem with the bailu logic is you still need to have a bailu ive been playing since day one and ive never pulled a bailu also i chose bronya as my free standard banner character cuz i also never pulled bronya lol
i never played hsr since launch hoyo games need to go in the trash
do i even get her or no cuz im guaranteed since i lost the to whats his name i cant remember how to spell it anyway do i get her or save for someone else
at what point did it ever get this serious lmao its literally not that serious browho gives af fr like actuallymfs acting like the worlds about to end or some shit
i still remember when i first found tectone i was trying ulala and looked up some vids on it to know if id actually like playing it long term been here ever since im happy i stayed
fair point kinda cos why couldnt her passive just be that she can multi res if shes on the team thats it or just give everyone the global passive when she inevitably joins the ship like every character does wether you pull them or not and give cass a regular passive idk what it would be but for instance i dont have jing yuan yet i can talk to him on the ship cos i finished his character quest these characters join the express wether you pull em or not ffs
actual mouth breather
not that bad is still bad
you cant even compare that to bailu because asstorice is not even a damn healer
there are actually gacha games out there that give you a permanent buff if you have a spefific kind of group or characters on your account but not on this aa level i think
good for all of us teccy uses hope this helps as video outro how to hit karens and morons at the same time
would be funny if hoyo put enemys into the game casting a debuff that prevents your characters from resurrection rip castorice
its because their doom posting and saying everyone is going to have a gp when that isnt even confirmed or proven besides people saying leaks and then not showing the proof of said leak its one big trust me bro
when netherwing disappears deals instances of dmg with each instance dealing quantum dmg equal to of castorices max hp to one random enemy at the same time restores hp by an amount equal to of castorices max hp plus for all allies
good for you and your castorise sustainer build then lololol
she heals and you are cooked
navalhabr the only thing thats cooked is your intellectual capability
navalhabr btw im sure your dps bailu build can also do m dmg alongside healing
im fine you are the one assuming things about my builds take your medicine bruh
navalhabr thanks id rather leave the meds for someone who actually really needs them you for example
navalhabr ohhoohh anywayy i just checked your comment history and turns out youre one of the daweis th yacht and wallet fanaticsdefenders lmao argument automatically dismissed theres nothing to discuss with ya
so you really have the meds holy s omg cooked again
baldtones new nickname should be discount saitama cause he has a massive hero complex
pw dead game
hey guys just a reminder tml is the release of castorice whoever cc pull for her is a immoral and evil person destroying the game and promoting gambling to their audience make sure we go in and destroy their chars these ppl do not deserve ana audience for promoting gambling
i disagree with the position that castorice is the end i just started a new account and its a fact that the difference of an accounts strength if it has therta and doesnt have it is major same with robin ruan mei tribbie or any other ss tier character the accounts strength completely changes with single character the not havers are already being beat down by the power creep and castorice itself isnt anything different than just a ss tier character with some additional functions for comparison i also had an old eu account with old s tier characters and that account is a complete joke even though it has numerous former s tier characters which are now trash and struggle with clearing penaconys normal enemies unless i run a dedicated heal tank my new account is in asia and that account has a yunli tribbie gallagher with himekoherta and i smashed through everything with that account if you already have therta or can shot content this will not change anything about that account it just reduces the chance of your character getting shot due to bad luck now the issues with global passives start when you start getting break efficiency type of passives but even then it doesnt really matter to new accounts or casuals this literally only affects the minmaxxers even without castorice we will see accounts getting through moc without an issue for me i dont see it as anything different from just part of the powercreep i really dont understand why teccy is freaking out while its indicating a negative direction for the game its literally no different from just snowballing through content with therta or any other ss tier main dps in your team so in summary things are already bad in terms of the power creep so that the power level of accounts is vastly different so at this point i think all players should just stop being hardcore invested in the game and just play it for what it is a single player game where you can gamble for characters the newest story is also kinda weak so instead of castorice being the end of hsr the writing team will kill the game first
summoners war did it really well for that global passive thing which was really amazing d
baldman quick a nuisance streamer vitaly has been prosecuted in the philippines and will now be put in prison
what if i love global passive because it makes everything stronger
global passive baldman nah i will skipping baldness
tectone you are the most worse gacha content creator your baldness literally destroyed the friendship and started a meaningless war among fandom
the dislike ratio of the video will be in the thumbnail except its an exaggerated one oh nice thanks for being clear about it
i hope wuwa add global passive in game to rover yes rover all player have him and its free why u ask well this is kuro
tec can you not fathom the idea that other people come to the same conclusion as you without watching your video
the craziest thing i still see regarding this is that end game players currently think her passive is even going to show up for them her passive will literally only help people struggling with content who the fuck is wiping at moc and was thinking man wish i had one more revive i really had them on their last leg no you arent failing content in cycles because of death its because of lack of damage not saying the global idea is good or anything just specifically talking about the usefulness of this passive even if it wasnt global it would still be ass unless of course they start shaping their content around it which would be stupid as hell considering new players after twenty days wont have access to her we shall see
castorice is goated and tectone is bald thanks for coming to my ted talk
hope this helps from teccy gets me every time lmao
what they should do is give global passives in some way for playerswho didnt pull for the character i wish they would listen to us cause if they did listen to us things would be so much different
bro probably thought people were complaining because it wasnt powerful enough he missed the whole point lol
funny thing is the passive is only really useful during the early game your problem during late game isnt really getting oneshot but dealing enough damage if you die during late game your team or relics just suck thats all aside from the fact that it revives you at hp which doesnt stop your enemy from doing you in during their next turn people didnt cry this much when acheron was released the character can literally skip battles
i just cant comprehend why hoyo thinks these blatant predatory practices pp for short are good for the game or their reputation in the long run
all roads lead to tectone
another moronic fool who doesnt understand the real problem here holy hell
if they somehow made acherons auto kill a global passive aka a second technique on all characters maybe something woulda happened but most ccs atp seemed like they wanted an out with the game they going with the idea that more global passives are coming when it was a fake leak being presented as real disengenousness masquerading as a movement her global passive is just the anniversary premium treatment and nothing more
one of the few sane comments here yes the passive itself is purz garbage for endgame players the only mere impact it could have is to make sustainless teams more accessible to bad players however castorice own mecanic actively wants a healer to gain hp after she lost so she can deal her damage and yes nobody cried about acheron while i personally felt bad having to farm longer bcs i skipped this dumbass bitch raiden mei and my fuckin casual friends spent m chrono in su while i took with great teams
who really dies in this game the game is easy it is not that bad lol this is why it is boring bc you step in can you stop being a killjoy
how much you wanna bet tectone isnt gonna quit the game like he said he was bet hell come up with some kind of excuse to work around it
bro choking on air comment got me
castorice in patch x now her passive revive all your characters with hp and you dont have do heal or shield thembecause reasons
look yall the last i have is aventurine and i pulled him on his rerun i stopped playing and only logged in again for the free bronya im not playing that much just the thought of having to go through the story to get primogems and most events feel like chores i really like castorices animations but it doesnt feel worth it to hop back in the game when i dont have any new characters that came after penacony progression is stale and i really dont see myself spending months trying to get one piece of artefact
people is so stupid that they cant get the problem is not the current gp mechanicbut the one coming after thisthe gp system itself
something i havent seen anybody say on either side is how notreallyinsignificant the passive is defenders say oh but the passive effect is tiny where reasonable people say this one is whatever but it opens the floodgates but when i thought about it its almost comically evil how subtly significant the passive is when you just look at the effect you think that eh its whatever but then consider every time you had a moment where youre into your thth cycle or even more if youre on a worse side at least minutes or just a mode where youre almost at the goal any mess up means lost run and then suddenly all enemies decide to jump at one ally tingyun and nuke that character out of existence while you cant do anything about it no ults not close enough to break enemies in time no emergency heals and then that death causes you to restart as you no longer have the damage to fit in time in the past youd be frustrated but you would know that its just bad rng there wasnt much you could have done but now you will know in the back of your head that if only you had castorice this bad rng moment wouldnt have happened
tbh i dont care about any of this i am fp and i will pull for castorice because i like her design and she has a dragon does this make me bad aswell
i like her gonna pull her with tickets saved reason she looks pretty and another waifu to add
i personally think anyone who cares positive or negative over a worthless mobile gacha temp passive needs a life reeval id like a real explaination why you for real think this matters lol not for view farming hopping on the dick of a content creator like a simp or joining the crowd like some cuck humans do this stupid shit all through history im gonna say this race is bad because all my friends do im gonna follow this dictator because its for my country im gonna be a libtard dye my hair blue and say all billionaires are nazis and burn cars because others are doing it and i feel like those that just do not give a fucking shit about these pussy chinese mobile preds just play the fucking game and shut the fuck upnot whine and bitch and moan like the pansy pussies you were raised as the soft weak willed sheep recent generations create and follow anyone caring at all of any videogame mechanic or aspect is actually sad
ok but tell my why harmony and preservation characters exist whats their sole purpose for the party how come a main dps character have a revive passive how come bailu have one what the hell even is harmony and preservation character at this point imagine not needing one of them because a global passive just gives you survivability
dude was out of breath the entire video hes got bigger problems than a gacha
me still using bailu and keep doin fine
as long as the community spenders dont give a f me as a fp also dont give a f these spenders keep me playing for free so just go and spend guys were cheering for you
the tower and pillars things you said i like that that wouldve been so much better than locking them into a character
tectone shutting up is even cooler
strange guy
hope this helps
tbh i feel like acheron is worse then castorice and nobody was talking about it on her release if u dont have acheron then youll waste your time fighting random shi you dont wanna fight
guys how about we leave it at criticising the points he brought up and not personally attack him for his breathing or way of talking thats so below what you should be he may have a bad take about the situation but no need to unnecessarily make a joke out of him
its not about her passives strength its about the fact theyre going to add more and more of these which becomes more and more useful if you dont pull the character with the passive ur account is fundamentally worse because of that
why wouldnt he he quit genshin
soilkilonova cuz he still talks about it every day has a podcast talking about it makes of his content relating to it etc
soilkilonova how many times did he quit genshin though only to come back anyway and give the company even more money
exactly
yes and no if multiple enemies target that one character and they die from the first attack they will revive but the other enemies in sequence will immediately kill your revived character again this is also true for multiturn characters such as hoolay banakademics the automaton and flamereaver ive been playing castorice myself all day and the revive has only actually helped me once my pela died vs aventurine revived hit the dice and then immediately died the next turn it allowed my acheron to clear the apoc without resetting but since pela died it significantly slowed down my run for someone new i can see how getting any amount of stars would have been satisfactory but as someone who has been playing for some time it still meant i needed to redo the floor
thecalmbeforethemaelstrom i see yeah of course its up to rng you may encounter such a situation where it wont save you you may even be lucky and not get such a scenario at all but you might also have a situation where it impacts the performance and is enough to give you a clear i think it can matter especially when you dont have the best possible team for a specific archetype or boss i remember struggling very badly against last apocs quantum bug and had a few times where i died while being really close to finishing him off in time especially with yunli and as youre saying it also helped you get a clear which yeah can be enough for someone newer or playing less especially with some endgames getting harder longer and more frustrating over time and with how many characters the game is releasing without being very lucky you just cant get all of them especially if you started later and of course it can matter more if they decide to give bosses more damage and specific mechanics that punish not having certain characters which i guess we will only see in the future although if i recall correctly i saw some people complaining about recent moc rotations being noticeably harder in that aspect
no he has already said if u dont care about improving the game then he doesnt care
no if you like something from this game that gives you enjoyment dont let others shame you because its your decision that matters to you alone at the end of the day
the reason why is because they liked the game back then so they let it slide she also was the start of light cones becoming op and feeling part of the characters kit then couple patches later we get yunli whos way worse without it
its tectone community there assholes at heart so they dont care
you know it would be pretty funny if they release a character that gets a benefit from resurrecting
not even a minute in and bros comparing being a hypocrite to being racist
more days til my queen comes home
reason why the dude still only have or so subs probably his alt accounts
do you have to spend money for her just play the game and they gave soo many jades from events and all sorts of contents in the game and they gave enough time to farm before her banner ended im fp so i know the situation stop spending like a crazy gambler if you do not get her be patient and farm again if you really want her if you do not want her then fck off
newer players can have cas because you get up to pulls in the anniversary patch according to some youtubers who calculated the stellar jade amount in this patch
they could be planning to add a insta kill mechanic on bosses later down the line and will make you regret not pulling for castorice
hsr is cooked well done global passives will eventually get stronger to the point that get better than some supports and substains and heat death might happen due to powercreep via global passives bruh
new players get more than enough currency in the span of weeks to gurantee a star so definately they can get cas
why is the revive permanent could of been like just extra rotation before you die again that way fp can get that tiny boost to beat the new castoricillion hp boss
i do not understand how people are having this much trouble to comprehend how this is simply a bad thing that will only fuck over the players
this guys sounds like hes running on a treadmill for hours and decided to record a video at the same time
it you think about it castorices global passive and tectones bald head are similar they are both world wide effective
its not bad but its also a must pull for everyone with an active account
super cringe when i see ppl defend this
i thought this would be another clickbait video and baldtone would just be playing wizardry but i am pleasantly surprised
people copin because they want to stay playing hsr thats fine edit actually its not fine since the game will get worse and these people settling for mediocrity allow it
mr pokke the global passives are predatory and bad for the game tectone well if you get castorice then you are a hypocrite and dont practice what you preach also tectone on the eidolons and light cones becoming necessary for characters to be usable this is predatory and bad for the game gets eidolons for sunday as well as the light cone anyway
huh have tectone tried and make a new account to say that its impossible to get castorice on week period cause ive made a new account and played only hrs for days and i got almost pulls already lol
for castorice defense she has a scytheand shes hot iam pulling completely fp tho i just started playing this month and got pulls from doing the story and some events i think as long as nobody pays them for making characters like this we will be good which is also impossible lol
shes coming tomorrow
source o damn geuss i have been lost in the sauce on poe
sadly that doesnt fit the narrative of everyone apparently needing cas to play the game or muh account bricked get ready to be called a hoyo shill who knows how many times
i think hoyo only did this to castorice and revive is pretty much taylored for beginners since castorice is an anniversary character ive checked all leaks for future characters and none have global passive
yeah exactly my thoughts as well because if you ask me castorice is hoyos favorite and mine as well she also just stands out the most from everyone dilucsf
because its not that deep if u dont want the unit dont pull if the passive pisses u off stop playingwhat i dont understand is why does it matter that much because those two options are quite literally available to u cuz as far as i see this passive does not affect anythingif ur so bad at the game that u need a free revive then u might as well just stop playingthis literally doesnt change shit and even if future characters get passives who gives af unless ur some meta slave that thinks they have no choice but to pull meta units its just not that deep bro
dilucsf too many people wanna just think that theres more coming when theres no proof that it was coming misinformation spreading like wildfire
wolvesbane pay to win mechanics
yeah but you dont know castorice passive will work in the endgame but we dont know about the other passives they are even real we will see its too soon to be mad about that
wolvesbane it is infact deep
i just like playing the story and characters
but that problem is for aglea who is unusable without es not sunday so idk what u r talking abt
he proved a point that its bad thats why he did it
sunday is perfectly functional without his lc or eidolons
kaguwah proving a point by giving the company more money enabling them further instead of just showing off a e sunday and explaining why he doesnt think its good enough
i feel like this is a moot point since hes quit the game and made a public spectacle of it unless he reinstalls the game and plays in the future
the fact you got likes for saying such non sense is horrific darklord
lmao bro just be yapping sometimes fr
wait everyone stop why did this guy rebind his attack and skill buttons to their opposite hes using an attack with e and using a skill with q who does that why do that
keeps happening since genshins first anniversary at least
bbut castorise is a god of death annd she wants to delay it
hare loss
im sorry but i just have to say it why is bro sometimes not all the time talking like hes beating the meat or is just gasping for air after running
i could make a better point for defending global passives and that point would be that it wont affect of the players since only a minority does endgame where global passives would be usefull and as long as they dont balance the game under the concept of everyone has the character so its fine given not everyone might have the characters as they dont give the character for free its totally fine to have global passives gated behind optional characters there is no competition in the game there are no guilds no leaderboards no pvp its purely a single player experience my account being stronger because i decided to pull for the gacha character is completly irrelevant as the only person afected by it is me but this only applies as long as they dont balance the game around the passives and even if they do it is still irrelevant as im not competing with anyone to see who can or can not clear endgame
she gonna be a must pull if hoyo does add in those bosses ive been hearing about that have insta kill
im so cooked lol
i was so fucking hyped for castorice until i found out about this global passive and with how awful the story is this time i just dont even want to play anymore
bro sould like
people making fun of this guy for a speech impediment are so out of touch
the amount of people in your chat and in this comment section just making fun of how this guy sounds is actually disgusting you can disagree with him but just leave it there instead making it personal and just making fun of him you dont know anything about him and the name calling garbage is so unproductive and childish
it could be a added in the simulated universe shop a healer card that removes de buff
i would like to remind people that a lot of things people have mentioned and things hoyo has been doing has in fact been done in hi ex spending events spend x amount of currency to get rewards and a skin tower like structures to grind for that give passive stats and abilities relics in the dorms and many others i dont feel like typing tldr hoyo knows theyre saying fu to all the players hope this helps
just wait till you find out about hyacines light cone her draining hp that should be in her base kit is literally locked behind her light cone
ok ill be honest i didnt know about her global passive as i renamed and changed pfp xd i just like pink haired anime girls bc im a filthy weeb i would love to have a honest answer if i already had a guarantee for tbe next unit have all the pulls saved and intended to pull her regardless just because of her design does it matter for me personally im not that active on social media but the line hope this helps seems like a running gag if there is someone kind and bored enough i would love to hear the context of it i compleatly missed it
you cant even watch the full video ffs
you know why hoyoverse not removing global passive because they are greedy and stupid
have you seen the new video of cantarella singing
as a gacha player who doesnt play hsr i think if the global passive is written in her kit its ok and if it is not written in her kit mihoyo should give player compensation and keep the passive
huh i dont see it are you sure you took your meds kira
brotha e is default
kkodeko i didnt actually its a problem but you can see it at
seylle in combat e is default for using a skill and q is default for basic attack dude in the video has it swapped e is basic attack q is skill at tectone has the video paused so you can see rappas skill during ult being locked and the attack button has e as the prompt
bbut castorice is not even in the team
ytwaldan xd
it makes casuals unable to do some endgame content for the in game currency forces even casuals not to play their favorite characters as a casual playing who started the game and grinded so hard for acheron and having super fun with her but knowing in a couple patches this character will be useless sucks hard what for did i farm on days end went twice to pity on weapon and character for which i had to grind all side quests main quest and a few events that i could do this game is a waste of time due to it forcing you to get the new characters and dumb old ones in trash
fugiyduck thats the thing most casualus dont do endgame regardless and it will always be a waste of time its a gacha full single player
loledu how are you going to gatekeep part of the game from the majority of your player base the point is that people level up and invest until the point of being able to do all of the content yes it takes time for casuals to get to endgame doesnt mean they should be scared away by the sheer hp inflation and just unfun endgame i think that statement is just lazy casuals dont play endgame its for sweats this company earns an ungodly sum of money and they cant even make every part of the game accessible for every player and offer voluntary difficult modifiers for said endgame if endgame is bad casuals will eventually drop bad endgame and the quality will go to shit even more because diehard fans or losers will eat slop any time of the day as a consumer we have the right to demand more and not settle for less because these huge companies have the resources and skill but the consumers have become so lenient so these companies see no incentive
fugiyduck i dont gate keep it its simply factual the majority dont do it you think the majority of the people play the game to beat moc thats simply false the majority of players play for weeks when a new patch comes and then quit the game until the next patch banner comes up the majority of players play to get a new character and quit thats why the game makes money people dont have to play it every day and beat every bit of content in order to collect the characters people can just spend money casualls wont eventuallyy drop endgame casuals dont do it anyway or at least dont care if they beat it or not characters with a good designdrip marketing make more money than poorly designed characters why do you think the game is filled with adult females instead of children why do you think kafkablack swan sold because they were strong or because the characters look good why do you think they turned sam into a girl that spends the entire quest going on a date with you why do you think acheron sold because she exists in every other hoyo game and the chinese comunitythe only one that matters to hoyo would go on strike if they didnt make her strong
i cant argue with you if you think being casual excludes wanting to play the entire game no one says you have to full clear zero cycle do perfect run people want their rewards so they can keep collecting their favorite characters people want to use their characters this is a strategy game after all not a dating sim there is plenty of those out there a character being visually appealing doesnt take away from the fact that you want to be able to use that character in the game the game had been in a better state and previously invested characters that had been good enough to clear all of content now cant do shit so ofc someone who loved kafka for her design and her storylore and learned her playstyle wont be able to do shit so people drop it because hsrs game design is trash they dont want to properly balance and dont want to change anything because the playerbase is just not really trying to get the best out of these companies because its majorily kids and people who are okay with the minimum
fugiyduck i cant argue with you if you think being casual excludes wanting to play the entire game you are arguing against nobody yyou quite literally dont get the point being made i will try again casuals do not play endgame they simply dont or at the very leaste casuals do not care about end game they can play but a passive being added to the game that would put them at a disadvantage is meaningless because again they dont care enough about end game to be bothered by it endgame is not the entire game far from it no one says you have to full clear zero cycle do perfect run people want their rewards so they can keep collecting their favorite characters people want to use their characters to play with the character you want you have th su game modes and du not endgame one more time casuals do not care if they get all rewards or not they dont care about being able to do endgame like you said yourself they want to use their charactershow do they do that they spend money a character being visually appealing doesnt take away from the fact that you want to be able to use that character in the game the game had been in a better state and previously invested characters that had been good enough to clear all of content now cant do shit so ofc someone who loved kafka for her design and her storylore and learned her playstyle wont be able to do shit so people drop it because hsrs game design is trash no one is arguing against use what you want one more time casuals dont care about end game they will use what they want if they beat it good if they dont its whatever better luck next time yes its shit design no one argued against it they dont want to properly balance and dont want to change anything because the playerbase is just not really trying to get the best out of these companies because its majorily kids and people who are okay with the minimum what is this like th time or something the majority of the player base the casuals dont care if the characters are strong or not theyy will use them for weaks beat what they can not beat what they cant and spend money on the next character they want to have you are tinking under the premise every single player wants to beat everything less then actually want to do everything in the game less then do end game you could argue players not caring is a problem sure totally agree with that just look at genshin years of players not caring and you cant get full resin in hours if you are arguing for everyplayer should be able to beat end game then i would have to disagree not every player should be able to that is something for players who invest in the game be it time or money what is the point of you trying do always get everything every patch to make sure you can pull a character if at the end of the day you can just use arlan and beat the entire endgame endgame is not a for fun mode it takes investment its meaningless investment as this is a gacha game but you cant penalize players for trying to always keep up with the game when you can do everything without keeping up with the game
bump
sums up tectones audience ngl
this is so true theyve been doing this since hi
pull who you want to pull in the end its your choice dont let others shame you for that the va for paimon had a meltdown calling everyone idiots for doubting the sag strike when her and other vas started harassing a new va replacing kinich thats the line she ended the rant on
benperbix thank you very much im a little smarter now
the big issue is hsr is like genshin where new interesting systems are all paid only a new user vs a veteran is exactly the same gameplay wise if they dont pull new units
the dude is literally the collective thoughts of every hoyocucks that defending the global passive made manifest they are literally screaming da wei milk us more please make global passives more so it can filter the player base i shit you not on how many hoyocucks are actually saying that they wanted to have move global passives to filter the player base and they dont actually care about their past investments on older characters they pulled before these people are cartoonishly stupid i cant even believe they are real human beings
this was a gibberish burger
they should have made it an unlockable character from farming or story it would be like the blueprint ships from azur lane everyone can get them but it takes a long time
rip hoyosheet
i wonder if we put anything on the reviews about skill trees that they might put them in but hoyo never listened we all know that
clicks on the guys video the video is private
i cant believe the blatant misinformation in this video were on daweis th yacht
what you will see with hoyoverse tactics of money making is they chopped off the most important base kit of the characters and sell it into their eidolons and signature lightcone and the worst case here is that they normalize these predatory practices or pp through the use of content creators business is all about marketing and psychological manipulation through social media and lots of people are falling to this basic urge they know where to hit you so you spend more money to them
frankly speaking im ust waiting for nte honkai is just timepass
he sounds extremely overweight
give the mc and a free star global passives
these people are trying to farm the shills we really do have the next genshin war coming
you can like star rail despite everything but dont shill i love star rail and ill keep playing but global passives being locked behind limited stars is extremely predatory and theres no excuse
how is this guy diyng while farming for chest or resource how its impossible to die unless you doing it on purpose looking for chest is a minute business every week maximum idk why he things is so important
new players cant easily get bailu but they can farm castorice you said new players cant pull castorice because of the weeks duration did you dmg your brain so bad and also genshin already implemented global passives long time ago
i think anyone who equates bailu and castoris is an idiot hey i mean bailu can only revive character and thats if bailu isnt dead hell nah
when castorices passive went live i believe they should make more global passives hsr players deserve to go bankrupt for their stupidity in supporting this dog company
yeah the castorice global passive is not that bad the problem is the existence of global passive behind the character thats the problem they should make it like wuwa whimpering waste make it like a token
is that literally a trash mobimagine having no creativity for making that mob
they did i dont play genshit so i dont know
bruh at least the global passive in genshin wasnt combat focused i dunno why i should even be saying it cuz combat is more important if it affects endgame
global reraise will help new accounts this game is very hard at the beginning you can try it yourself create a new acc new acc is going to pull castorice for sure weeks is enough to farm k jades
limca and why do we get so paranoid about the future of hsr global passives genshin never implemented something bad or ruin the game to its global passives
for sure they wont implement global passive that increases spd to all units because it will ruin tribbie castorice and also all other units
even if they decide to add new gloval passives that affect combat hoyo is not stupid and make those passives to powerfull you shouldnt compare tectones braincells to hoyos
hianfly they can just code the spd increase to only take effect after combat starts which wouldnt ruin the relic sets at all
drakingp yes but it doesnt mean they will do it this kind of paranoia is crazy it seems you know nothing about dynamic spd like that can ruin your relics setup
i didnt say they would im pointing out how you can implement the passive without destroying those characters due to how their relic sets work and even then highly doubtful that youre gonna brick your account or units with it i doubt them adding a spd passive but i dont think arguing that itll ruin those characters is gonna prove that point
they wont release crit rate def pen res pen because those buffs are destructive to the game i think they are not that stupid
limca genshin has global passive never played genshin so i dont know
the said global passive is just crafting materialsbeing able to view pickable materialsores in the map while near yourunning faster and thats it that doesnt affect combat in the slightest
genshin focus is exploration so those global passives are very good there
tldr you cant deny that genshin had has global passives for a long time ago
say that to the cn community
hsr will pretty much die along with gi because theyre both made by the same company
yato gi never died and never will same with hsr thats the sad reality
ashiqprio pretty much yes but stories from both games are quite amazing though
yato for me they are average at best for most part i guess they are good for a gacha standard but even games like arknights nikke pgr limbus company and even their previous honkai series have better stories i would have let it pass if they had great storytelling like wuwa and zz but nope but i would say genshins fontaine arc was really good but they couldnt hold on to that quality in natlan
they will die every game will meet their end no such thing as eternal game ashiqprio
ashiqprio if only wuwa story has been that good from the beginning lol i still cant get through the jinzhou act because of how jarring and bad paced it is
ilham just use the holy skip button for me only was good is mid and the rest are
bro is out here dying to mobs in the overworld i thought bro was going to argue that he rarely dies or something as for it reviving multiple people all the footage that comes up or from the live is of one unit being revived
ta
the fact that were still on this is kinda sad at this point if its something you dont like why make content off of it genuinely
why ppl still play this game is beyond me it peaked in like what more is there to experience from this game other than a monotonous long story you cant skip and autoable combat which incentivises you to not even play the game
and the video is private who coulda guessed lul
cmon man now the video is taken down
he privated the video lmao
cant finish the video its unbearable to listen to a literal mouth breather
hope this helps
why does the guy sounds like hes constantly on the verge of vomiting
wouldnt everyone having access to the global passive via some tower system be terrible because it would cause the devs to develop the game around having that access which would also just further time gate newer players its not as if the devs designed the game around people having access to an instant overkill button for mobs in the overworld via acheron or chests that would be impossible to find if not for the herta so why would it be different for castorice the appeal to the slippery slope is fallacious if you cant meaningfully demonstrate that slope anyone at any point in time can imagine a slope but i think if were intellectually honest we can all agree that it would be unreasonable to never walk again because you mightve slipped and fell once before
im pulling castorice bc i want her on my account i have multiple e characters acheron firefly so i dont feel like the passive helps my account i just have wanted her since seeing the teasers ive skipped every banner until now i wont be spending any money on her banner i have guaranteed and enough free earned jades to get her nor will i be going for any eidolons i simply am pulling her because i want her but in regards to the global passive it was not needed nor asked for it just sucks that its attached to castorice since shes a very popular character that people would want to pull for same could be said for people who really like mydei the herta etc etc and if the passive was attached to one of those characters instead now people who have a castorice will be seen as someone who essentially approves of the global passives when majority of us pulling for her are casual players who just like her design and playstyle and the dragon ofc not all upcoming characters will have a gp but any that do will be frowned upon to pull for and it does nothing but cause a divide in the player base bc hoyo wants more money and goes about it in the worst ways possible make hsr great again
yeh its soo bad it was worth loosing a friend over
why is that guy talking about the games only star character
and i quote this patch has a lot of good things free character in the future
mins after teccy reacts og video is already unavailable lmao
the herta was the reason i quit star rail completely i pretty much stopped already before she released but thought might as well try pull her with the jades i got didnt get her tho and i got tired of spending money for characters so i quit pretty much planning to stop spending as much on zz too way too many hard pitys in a row
imagine if youre just starting out and you find out theres a character that you must have cus your copy of the game is literally inferior without it its like a dlc but its not available to buy anytime you have to wait for it to and only god knows when itll pop up again its not jsut one dlc but like or more and even if you own maybe or its still inferior cus you need em all
the reasons why global passives on limited stars are good buffs your older characters more incentive to pull new units game is all about meta anyway getting global passive exodia is the future of this game limited stars become future proof even if they are powercrept hoyo can shift the power budget into passives instead of powercreeping every character every patch global passives especially future ones add a layer of convenience for players struggling to balance relics and lacking light cone stats this passive in particular is very nice for sustainless teams in certain scenarios which is a good qol for people lacking meta sustains global passives are just little bonuses and if we get a lot more of them in the future its very likely that in order to keep the game running smoothly there will be a limit on how many can be active at once and that means there is nothing to worry about because you can already acquire most characters even as a fp so that implies you will have plenty of options to choose from just need to wait till more characters come out
its more than one character what
for money and to bring attention to it
because it sets a bad precedent for the industry when a market leader introduced a scummy fomo mechanic that only the most predatory c list games employ it has potential of being introduced in other games if it succeeds ubisoft getting away with single player qol dlc is a good example of this all of a sudden after that a ton of games after that started doing it too most notably bandai namco sony and ea the market isnt a vacuum and when star wars battlefront got massive backlash for its incredibly scummy monetization where u have to play years to earn a character fp after that no other game attempted to be that scummy i know hoyo players may not play other games but this is a gamers perspective on why we care its an eternal battle between predatory monetization and fomo practices and the player in a ever more costly world
authenticinarifox is understandable but regardless of that my point is if youve already thrown said game out the window why make more content on it as if your gonna change there minds and even if they did change there minds its not like your just gonna magically start playing it again i see it as pointless tbh
juicyjstn because it brings them money and views yes its bad to have it in game but it aint illegal if it was then just sue the damn company problem done but of course streamers are only big on talk they cant back it up outside of their community so they farm it and have idiots watch it while they roll in profit
authenticinarifox tectone dont really want to improve the industry lets be real he is just farming views because u know how big the hoyo fandom is he hates hoyoverse thats it
yuji_ why would you want hoyoverse to improve when its helping content creators in fact fomoverse are unironically helping cc farm money lmfa
why you surprised he doesnt like genshin yet he keep making genshin videos for years you should know that he will do the same for hsr
i still like the story and i like the characters plus the found family stuff with the astral express
ill explain it this way it wouldnt be bad because they already have the perfect system to tie it in with built into the game already the equilibrium levels it wouldnt be so easy to have it to where after a certain equilibrium level you gain currency to unlock buffs in a linear tree that affect the world and for the whole acheron and therta scenario those two are just gimmicks that arent really that useful outside of the a few exceptions like du for acheron and spamming combat encounters and you could literally just use youtube to find all the chests but for the castorice passive being put to a tower or something you dont really have to reinvent the wheel there if you check your buffs list you will find buff x that you acquired that will give your character extra life after reaching hp they need to either be shielded or healed before their next turn or die as soon as they take there next turn and it would literally be as easy as disabling the passive for endgame modes entirely and the issue is solved not more problem either that or having it only work for castorice hell you could even extend it to any chrysos however its spelled heir characters on your team and itll be way better and cool lore wise sorry for rambling hope you got something useful out of my point of view i can see why youd think the way you do as well
the difference is that acherons and hertas abilities are a quality of life that cant affect late game content castorices global passive does you might have seen how the moc became overtuned where using the same characters people were unable to star moc level when in the moc just before that level bosses had less hp than that level hoyo does and will tune combat encounters around limited characters a tower system would allow everyone to be at the same playing field limited character global passives could fuck over everyone who doesnt have that limited character hoyo could introduce a boss that does a billion damage once per battle if you have castorice its like nothing happened if you dont have castorice then you cant beat that boss if the same boss was made with a tower system being in place then all youd need to do is do the content that gives you the ability to survive instead of having access to a character who might not even be available for years after the first run players gain nothing by having the global passive on a limited character instead of it being tied to an ingame system but players who dont have the character could be at a serious disadvantage compared to ones who do
i wish i could set it to show me this comment again in months time to see if its aged well or not
kiranightv all of that couldve just been summed to one word could ill repeat myself show me something in all of hsr history where clearing endgame was gatekept by a single limited unit you wont be able to so dont bother youre pointing to one imaginary point on a graph and describing a slope when at least mathematically you need at least two points on a graph to show a slope logically you need many points to even begin to justify a slippery slope appeal furthermore you speak of quality of life as if it cant be applied to endgame when theres nothing mutually exclusive about the two nearly everyone during x complained about their tingyun dying that it became a meme and most of the time it was just bad luck so this prevents one reset and saves time
gameplayerone boss hps has been increasing with every single moc patch i brought up an example for the biggest jump weve had recently i wasnt bringing up moc because i think it proves that theres a slippery slope the fact that castorice isnt the only limited character with a global passive who will be released during amphoreous is people who have beta access have already confirmed that there are other characters who will have global passives and before you try to argue that theyre not out yet so we wont know if the global passives will stay we had the info about castorice way before she dropped and even though people complained the global passive is still there so theres no reason for hoyo to not make other characters with global passives i was being hyperbolic about a boss dealing a billion damage but i dont see how it would be worse for the players to be able to get the global passive after the character banner isnt available tingyun getting killed because of dumb luck is thing but if you think about it her reviving midcombat is not the same as a new reset lets just imagine a scenario where your sustain cant keep up with the boss damage and your characters get slowly get stacked with debuffs that deal more damage than your sustain can counter we already have stacking damages that enemies can deal and with how the bosses have kept getting stronger with every patch there will be a point where they deal more damage than you can heal now adding in castorices passive will mean that the character who would have otherwise died will continue like nothing happened at that point its not up to luck that your character died its an inevitability but castorice can prolong it long enough to get you through meaning that there absolutely is a way that you be indirectly gatekept by not having her
kiranightv i dont know why yall cant admit that youre just unable to substantiate your theory save yourself the time also you did just appeal to the slippery slope argument i did assume at first but you confirmed it so my assumption turned out to be correct maybe your assumption about castorices global passive will turn out to be correct too but its just that an assumption
gameplayerone bro just because you dont understand what im saying doesnt mean that its not substantiated if i bring up a point and you just say nah that doesnt mean youre in the right stop trying to aura farm castorices global passive is a warning sign a red flag that doesnt mean hsr is going to eos immediately but you need to stop huffing copium saying its not that bad because thats exactly how a slope starts ill use this word again it could get better it could make hoyo not have global passives for other characters but having one has already crossed a line and hoyo doesnt have any incentive not to cross it more than once when it brings them more money
kiranightv its worse than i thought you dont even know what evidence is or maybe im blind because i didnt see you provide any example where endgame was gatekept by a single limited unit or a mechanic unique to them all you seem to have done is point to some general hp inflation and a mere future possibility in which case thats called speculation not evidence i very clearly laid out what i was looking for so i apologize that im not taking your speculation seriously but in all fairness it was a very unserious response unfortunately if you dont even understand what counts as evidence then nothing im saying will make any sense guess well just have to agree to disagree
all the leak rumors that chars are in work with global passives were fake streamers sloped it like idiots this global passive is nothing at all i am a es player since day spent k on the game now my fp acc got mydei es lately and he can solo moc because infinite revives so people bitch too much and create too much drama plus standard banner is getting rememberence char watch it be castorice so her passive be for all watch streamers act like hypocrites then
yue stating you spent k on the game is not the flex you think it is we are getting more global passives you genuinely believe castorice will be the only one they are testing the waters with it and obviously have more coming since they already have the content planned a year in advance to claim castorice will be on the standard banner actual copium genuinely delusional
thawingkarma lol if they get too much backlash from players they can just milk her banner then announce she is going into standard banner in or just to shup idiots up i personally do not give a fuck if we get or dont get global passives it doesnt affect me there is no hard enough content to benefit from it plus even curreny moc you can clear with seele and pela tingyun and rmc or even jingliu can clear it in less than cycles so those passives wont do rats ass for those players who already clear shit with ease in the game and got damn well built chars they will only allow casual players to have easier time instead of thinking as for your in advance lol there is currently not a single char for next patches that has global passive we know all legit leaks of every char coming for next patches and none of them has a global passive as for you thinking k spent was a flex nah it wasnt its just how bad rng on actually is i had banners where i lost in a row i dont care much for that because i can afford it which is why i help friends get thier pulls if they are sort
yue they are not going to send the new shiny toy and one of the most broken newly released units into the standard banner regardless of how much backlash they get and they wont even care because the worst that will happen is them loosing just a couple million dollars and theyre still going to introduce more global passives down the line thats just a nobrainer and its weird for you to claim it isnt a flex when you are literally mentioning how much youre spending in these gacha games in pretty much all of your other comments
thawingkarma no brainer huh and where is your factual evidence that they will do so and if its a flex then why the fuck would i be giving days of express passes or getting them jades for es or es depending on what char need to people in discord server i am its about to people every patch and reason i can do it is because i have shit ton of money from investing and running corporate business for last years despite how i sound about games and passives i am a nice person who actually helps people in discords to get stuff when they cant and if i wanted to flex i just post a pic of my bank account but instead i am helping out fp and low spenders in hsrzzgenshin because thats my way of giving back what i made by being lucky and working hard now days all the communities are shit and full of drama you all play a damn game people hating on a game because of new inovations in the game fucking laughable no one asks people to spend no one forces them to spend either the game is easy enough that you dont need brand new toys to beat content its like if my company made cure for blood cancer and charged for it people would make drama over it becausr it aint free yet company spends bilions in research lol hsr aint a bad game is people creating big ass drama over shit that plenty of other games got already or because of their own personal assumptions without any factual evidence
thawingkarma whether they do or dont its up to them not like the game is hard enough to need global passive you can legit beat current content using and chars with no issue if you build them good enough which with current gears is easy as for flexing i dont i might say shit about global passive not being bad but its still predatory in the end i made my cash from investing and running medical business for last years i help people in server i am in to get express passes across their games and es or es chars when they needed it like this drama over global passive is pathetic just because streamers farm it for views to earn some lousy paycheck instead of being more productive its like people complainng and creating drama over my company making meds for blood cancer and charging for it yet mil was spent in research but no one considers that lol i rather people have fun in their game than for them to hear shit drama over video game xd i told people in server i am in you lose your me and i send you jades to get it same for pass i have far to much cash to begin with donating to charity is meh now days i rather spend k a year on people i know will enjoy and have fun and stress less than to give mil to charity and know that in reality only be given to the cause charity donations is corporate tax break nothing more despite you thinking that its a flex its not just way to say how shit rates are if i wanted to flex i post pic of bank acc xd
yue except their not going to move her to the standard banner cuz thatd basically be false advertising secondly if they wanted to do that they wouldve announced that shed move to the standard banner now instead of waiting till after her banner to say something
amari nah it wouldnt be because blade and seele and fu xuan getting moved to standard banner there for that exlusive limited character thing no longer exist just because someone spends to get character earlier thats on the people they can move any char into standard banner because its their game and you all signed that you allow them to make changes to their game moment you made accounts so if law is considered its fair game if it wasnt then seele and blade and fu xuan being moved to standard would be subjected to class action lawsuit over their limited status given that players pull for chars due to limited time banner so them moving those three down to standard or making them free would be breaching consumer rights
making them free is one thing and even then their vastly older units who are tied to a different system instead of being completely removed from the limited pool but again if they were going to move her to standard or make her free they wouldve already announced it its the same reason why they cant change stuff a lot on release
amari doesnt matter because i am pretty sure my lawyer would find a legal hole in this easily consumer right got massive scope for hoyo to be free of any wromg doing they would have to announce at lunch of game that limited banner units will be put into standard banner sometime during game life cycle making them pullable with free currency that way consumers wouldnt go so hard on those units if they knew that they might become free which if a good lawyer would look at it they would easily find it illegal and a breach of consumer rights and start class action against hoyo and screen through player base of who has set units so they get refunded due to it being false advertisment at start of the game
look i didnt even know that he reacted to it until a few hours ago after i put the video back up
imthatghostyt do you have a condition irl not trying to insult genuine question
kkodeko is english not your first language considered a condition
bro forgot there are people playing just for fun and the story
ayushkcvx except what exactly is there to do for fun most casuals dont touch end game which means theres next to no content in the game to play with and the story isnt even good to justify playing solely for it
amari sim uni story enjoyment is subjective not objective you might not enjoy it you not enjoying it doesnt mean a lot of other people dont enjoy it
sim uni is also endgame
there is end game sim uni and there is also casual play sim uni and it would be very disingenous to say sim uni endgame is anywhere near the same level as moc apoc or pf in terms of being endgame
except what would constitute as not endgame all the listed versions of endgame youve listed have is just bloated hp pools some random mechanic to give it some spice sim uni is still end game content as all end game content is just repetitive content that gives rewards none of their game modes are that unique people just talk bout them cuz mic and the others are something that mildly stimulate the brain enough to be memorable
amari sim universe is not an end game mode you can beat that game mode even if you run an team of sustains you just need to right blessings
amari in an turn based game you will always get repetitive content
you do realize that end game modes are optional content thats not tied to the story mode for a game right it doesnt matter the difficulty of the mode if its optional content then its end game people just twisted the definition of endgame to exclusively need to be difficult content
amari i can hop into gold and gears at any level right now i can play du and just do different runs right now i can go and play base sim uni or swarm disaster right now i can do all of that for no rewards and are always i can go and play the rogue like game modes just for the fun of it your definition is just trying to be broad for the sake of it sim uni is giving completion rewards after you reach that point it stops rewarding you you are trying to extend the definition of endgame but you and i both know that when anybody says endgame in hsr they are talking about moc pf and apoc difficulty v sim uni does not register in anybodys mind and even then that game mode makes everyone viable to play by just giving you the stats there is a difference between endgame and gameplay that has difficulty tiers with your logic replaying story missions if we could do that would count as endgame since at one point they gave jades
i mean repeatable content also repetitive comtent exist in ton turn based games but at this point you guys are stretching the goal post to the point everyone in this thread is more focus on pointlessly discussing what counts as endgame than actually getting to a meaningful point
yes replaying story content would also be end game since its optional content all rewards do is give people a reason to do the optional content congrats you understand what endgame is now i gotta ask how exactly does any of this change my statement of casuals dont play endgame because all you guys did was pointless yap in a circle over the specifics while going absolutely nowhere
bro you just classified the entire game as endgame we cant go anywhere cause youre actively just being disingenuous
drakingp doing story content because you need it to unlock content and regions is different from repeating story content for jades you are doing these things for completely different sets of reasons how are you this braindead that you fail to understand the very example you made
again what point are you trying even make because all youve done is spend more time discussing wat counts as end game than actually getting to a point
no i made the point like at the start you just decided you didnt like the answer and popped domain expansion shift goal post to side step the point sim uni and a replayable story mode are not endgame casual players play sim uni casual players do runs in the various sim uni modes even if they dont get rewards casual players also just replay endgame modes for the fun of it to test different teams we got to the point you just keep rejecting it with overly broad definitions
optional content is endgame content just because theres a specific set of modes that are different that the community solely classifies as endgame doesnt mean anything my main point is hsr doesnt really have much that really worth staying for
amari i stay for story and characters
benperbix cool
these are some crazy bad reasons u have to gamble to get the new character so its not a guarantee that you get the character if you are a fp or light spender it may buff it but its for a price of not being able to pull any character that you want there is already enough incentive to pull new units because they powercrept the hell out of the old ones anyways and are jacking up the hp of every piece of content in the game how is a limited star gonna be future proof if for example a character is just dogshit but has a great global passive like crit rate its just gonna be sitting in your account doing nothing except give the bonus edit i realized that this is future proof this is a bad argument but doesnt change the fact you have to pay for this and you have to choose this over another character that was the point of my argument hoyo just gonna shift power budget into both now both global passive and base kits gonna get more and more nuts its literally their track record this is not a layer of convenience because now you have to choose between a global passive or a unit that you want fps and light spenders dont get enough currency to guarantee a character every patch so whats gonna happen if a patch as global passives just spend just wait for rerun just get lucky because just spend or get lucky is a retarded argument that doesnt even need an explanation if you need to understand that i pray for you now the wait for rerun argument probably gonna get powercrept according to hoyos track record and we dont have enough to guarantee a character a patch and there are new ones every patch so what do people do then this is not a good qol because its not a free qol again you have to pay for this no the global passive will not be little bonuses they will be roadblocks for people who cannot obtain said characters hoyo does not give enough pulls to guarantee a character every patch not to mention their lightcones this doesnt give more options this limits options forcing players to pull on character that have good global passives in order to keep up with the meta if you dont account is worse than someone who does
this has to be satire theres no way
karma my initial comment was just pure irony but now that i come to think about it shouldnt you be spending in gacha games anyways like thats the point of gachas theyre not meant to be played for free yes you can try the game and its absolutely free but if you want the best experience then pay up corpas need money and fun activities like playing videogames cost money for the consumer just like going to the movies or going to a club going to a sports event now this sucks for people who cant afford a global passive character but then that means you should probably not be spending your free time playing video games gachas in particular ok actually i dont truly believe in what ive just said but it does feel like people are very disillusioned with games being free and them having the notion that all content should be free too which clearly isnt the case because companies are made to earn money and adding these new passives is a good way to boost revenues and you shouldnt be disappointed with the fact that the company is earning billions either their profits show that they have a successful business model and that they have a good gameproduct and for all its worth you can make a similar game and be earning the same amount of money everyone says oh it costs nothing to develop hsr but dawei needs another yacht he is greedy and stupid ye sure if it was that simple wed have hsr clones on the market yes global passives suck for the average consumer but this is a gacha and if castorices banner beats records then thats just going to prove that hoyo knows what theyre doing
zarya yea but you can still call out bad practices instead of supporting it i think the most recent example is nintendo switch like seriously paying that much for a console and game as well as a tutorial i get it just do whatever you want but calling out these bad practices seems to be so uncommon in the gacha space maybe everyone is just tuned out but still
i agree but the community is definitely overreacting on this one a global passive is the same as any powercreep like jingliu like acheron like feixiao like the herta couldnt care much about it its been the same thing every patch everyone keeps playing and keeps pulling and the community is shitting on players for not having eidolonslightconesmeta supports and its never going to be better calling out every bad business practice is the same as calling out everything in every new patch but players are continuing to play the game and it doesnt seem to matter for most and its not our right to stop them from enjoying this predatory game you can hate them though but like xd telling the truth and being a hater to those people who dont care thats not what i want to sign up for ive got other things to care about irl
oh hey i submitted this in the daily scramble
bye bye
nah i dont care if my account is infinitely worse than the next guys as long as i get the character that i want oh shit the next character buffs cdmg for all units globally but its on a character i dont care about who cares next
it just needed to be a normal passive cas actively kills your team having that safeguard would have been fine all this has shown me is i need to quit not even because of the global passive but because this community desires the game to be shit i cannot wait for the day a global passive increasing pure dmg happens because all this we do not know it will happen again and oh but this one is not that op is going to fall apart at that point and i have zero hope for this game so i would rather it fall off a cliff and provide entertainment at launching at the shit eaters this point hoyo deserves their money with how much they have trapped their minds to support them its impressive really
dude why does he sound like hes dying lol
there is no global passive in ba sing se there is no global passive in ba sing se
even some older players who cant afford or are fp cant pull the character this game is cooked also fuck em idc ill play wuwa anniversary incomming woohoo
as a cookie run kingdom player i dont care about this news im just here to preach the cookbook
omg this video is dogshit but the chat
this guy really needs to just sit back and calm down so out of breath
hope this helps
brother im tryna go to sleep to your vid stop playing adds on min videos baldy
oiled up tectone
man sometimes i just wanna hear teccy finally say it momoi
what a painful video to watch
another days of good for new players
the reason why i am pulling for castorice is that i love deaththemed characters scythe users and dragons she got all of them so edit hey guys i am a small youtuber who just started recently ill be adding more videos to my channel soon
maybe the real global passive was the friends we made along the way
you see google play store now rate what happens hsr
you should react to catorice global passive is badbut not the end of the world it does a better job explaining things
thats cool until hoyo inevitably balances all end game expecting you to have that cdmg
ilasperr well if i cant clear the end game then so be it who cares in the end like i said i still got the characters i wanted im here to goon to the hot characters not some numbers on the screen or some virtual currency
facts my cookie speak your thang indeed
no the real global passive is breaking friends apart
lost along the way
what friend
its for me
this guy sounds like hes having a hard time breathing
i mean its not a stat boosts its just revival but whatever who cares
just make the mc have the global passive hello
if you look closely at tectones bald head you can see the light of a dying star from millions of years ago hitting it
exactly you should also criticize wuwa for doing it
its a nothing burger bro
good ol baldy back to farming the nearby air for dumbasses only to bring attention to them which definitely doesnt historically spiral down a dumb drama where the dude gets a massive head and becomes desperate for attention
dont let tectones bald head distract you from the fact that castorices global passive sets a dangerous precedent for gacha games
the guy in the video speaks so slow like he is out of breath or somethingfaceorangebitingnailsfaceorangebitingnails
a newer player pulling castorice would use her still no reason for it to be global
is not that
the guys voice that ur reacting to is so ubearable to listen to i imagine tat this is how global passhills sound like on a daily basis
its not that the global is bad its just the concept of it and how future characters will become must pulls pro tip dont pull for a character just because of that only pull if you like them or like their playstyle
no no no it is that bad
guys video is went up in flames faster than hoyos revenue from farming the financially nearsighted remember its not the concept of the global passive its not the effect of the res its the global passive being locked to a limited character you have to spend currency on open your wallet please let us farm you
if you just pull the character you get a universal buff thats so unbalanced people just going to pull the characters that give buffs then the characters that people want
my god that thumbnail showing that like to dislike ratio the amount of dislikes dam
is the guy talking ok
pokke could learn a lot from this dude
him this is good for new players also him just pull bailu or get a very specific blessing that may or may not appear in sim uni oh yeah im sure the newer players will all get bailu and castorice in pull
neptunia based but the larger problem is that itll inevitably be a stat boost
richkero the thing is thats just speculation not confirmation
mc doesnt sell
gazefubv hsr mc has always been a meta unit so i dont know what you even mean by that
ayushkcvx so now always means since
ayushkcvx u cant spend money on mcunless if its a sig lcbut likeno one is doing that
ayushkcvx they cant make people spend money for the mc everyone has them and you can only obtain eidelons through fp ways
antoninsimardbd i think you are forgetting that fire mc was also good when he first came out an aoe taunt skill was good at that time when enemies didnt hit as hard as they do now
ayushkcvx it was good till it got replaced by something else that does it job better
ayushkcvx you completely missed his point hes saying putting global passive on a free charactermc doesnt sell because you know the mc is free
shurenshimitri ya cuz they had to release another mc just like how they released fugue cuz hmc will switch to rmc for the entirety of x
why not give all characters a global passive give mc global passive one for each path
ayushkcvx they say doesnt sell which literally mean hoyo make no money for putting a fomo passive on free unit
yup if mc have global passive skill i think community should calm for a while because all players deserve have this without pull from gacha but from dawei simulator games impossible hahahahahaha
or better yet do what wuwa did with spectro rover and make global passives obtainable via story completion it would even be an easier way to explain the ability through lore without a bullshit last minute answer like she dont likey death
hello
gazefubv it does by making the game more popular and attracting a new audience but it is more advanced marketing technique that require you to not treat your customers like shit
early leaks i saw someone mentioning they might add the passive in some other way for everyone in later patches
ayushkcvx good in what being a free trial version of fuxuan no cleanse no heal and extremely skill point demanding the only thing they can handle is the monkey
ayushkcvx he means what he means the mc doesnt sell like its not that hard to understand
i dont get the whole deal about this global passive mydei can revive if he dies whenever he goes into that red aura mode and he can basically not die multiple times per match and i dont see people complaining
""

a good comment
huh
like whatwuwa dont have global bs
care to provide an example that is remotely similar
hes talking about cantarella swimming like faster than other characters wellysen swimming passive isnt particularly useful since the new area you can fly use a boat that goes exponentially faster than swimming etc shorekeeper is the only other one with something similar but she turns into a butterfly and goes slightly faster as well as lumi but that isnt an issue due to speed boosts all over the map etc the swimming passive also does barely anything in the prior areas since theres little to no places no reasons to go swimming
rrspaced kinda weird how people take her passive as a negative and consider it predatory when most features similar to it can be used for free
dis dumbass wanna drag wuwa on hsr topic just like other west cc
rrspaced its lik the same crap they pulled on neuvillete and no one was complaining on that one huhdouble standards btw the passive was swim slightly faster in underwater areas and it was unique only to him
cantarella can swim for long time but do we need swimming in wuwa if something comes up devs will take care
if you mean swimming cantella she doesnt work in the tower
yup his argument makes no sense
that bad in the end of the day is just a game
people with slurred speech need to be banned from media choose a diff career also an actual mouth breather lol
he is fighting for hoyo contact or early access d d
i thought im the only one who cant watch this without thinking why does this person have to speak this way
it is bad makes the game unbalanced
wsone unbalanced is mydei perma infinite revives i solo moc with mydei at es in cycles and es mydei only took me pulls to get
yue sure but what about the low spenders or fp who usually cant afford to pull every character
wsone low spenders will have shop reset thats es guaranteed as for fp on average each patch is about pulls and fp shouldnt pick random chars to begin with this is for all games cast es hits for about m on average for aoe her global passive aint useful unless your teams are bottom of the barrel only chars fp shouldnt skip is harmony since you can still clear all content with s seele with pela and tingyun and rmc aslong as you get speed on pela and rmc and tingyun which aint hard with piece speed gear that we got sets of
yue the main issue i have with global passives is the predatory nature of it fomo taken to new heights skip this character and not just your favorite team but every team you own will be missing something
authenticinarifox its predatory true but to call it fomo i dont agree even more when you can still easily clear moc and pf with units from and with no issue if you got a brain and actually build your team i usually help a lot of people i chat with get their es or express passes so they can always get their chars because they enjoy the game even show them how to beat using old chars so they dont have to think fomo
yue not fomo sure buddy are you saying youre gonna skip the chars with global crit dmg crit rate spd too its the literal definition of fomo lol you can clear with units is an equally meaningless excuse for this point global passives locked behind premium units is bad not matter how shit the passive is to you
legolasdf and where do you see set global passives i seen all legit confirmed leaks for next patches none of them has any global passives and yea it aint fomo given that crit dmg after increases your dmg by less than and speed aslong as you got over speed on supports and sustain it aint needed hp just shove mydei in the fight he has infinite perma revives and we dont have any evidence of them making chars with global passive aside from cast
yue youre right idk where they get their information about upcoming characters having global passives there was no confirmed characters except castorice there was a recent leak that says phainon dont have global passive and yet here in youtube everybody saying he has and also fomo is not really an issue if you pick and build your characters right
zek they are still slorping on the fake leaks from weeks ago those were already proven false
zek they are still talking about the fake leaks from weeks ago those were already proven false but hey drama vids for them more views
yue its one big trust me bro moment
idk why they just didnt make the global passives free
datvictini money
my wallet is closed i dont need to swipe i just save when i know a unit i want is coming up
osprey and the gameplay will be altered thanks to the other gp characters coming in x good on you for not spending but im not envious for the coming state of an already unstable game
datvictini mr crabs money
osprey what if you dont want that character tho
osprey i mean even fps are contributing however small that contribution may be to greenlighting the passive by saving and pulling on the character
lack of creativity that they rely on op traits and dmg numbers of character to sell characters hoyo is a deadhorse
txtallynotkev just skip
queenaiphxi people would have already summoned for castorice just cause of her crazy animations but this devs just want more money and i guess they are thinking about a future where they dont have to go all out on a new character just put a op gp and they will become must have
just pull for it then next patch gives jades anyway just cope cause we cant do anything about it
do you have to spend money for her just play the game and they gave soo many jades from events and all sorts of contents in the game and they gave enough time to farm before her banner ended im fp so i know the situation stop spending like a crazy gambler if you do not get her be patient and farm again if you really want her if you do not want her then fck off
nashrinazali exactly vro
spend money to get a limited character nah i get them for free
if you dont pull her then what lose pvp with other people cannot clear end games skill issue
each patch we get jades worth character including losing l unless yall want all the characters in patch
how can you be so moronic to not understand the situation it will make the devs create more limited characters with global passive locked behind these characters in a fucking gacha so put then all global passives together and if you dont have them then its gg predatory crap apokarin
well i hope wuwa add global passive in game to rover yes rover all player have him and its free why u ask well this is kuro
datvictini thry can tied it too story after you finish x story your account got x buff if we are talking about lore why not do just that then ofc because they want more money v
i definitely should been a lot more focused on that
like at least hi gives global passives through farmable divine keys and standard dorm characters this game is doing something worse than that if they make this into a trend from now on but if they stop at this i cant be too mad about it tbh just a bit salty about the preferential treatment but realistically it wont impact my experience by that much except in simulateddivergent universe
txtallynotkev exactly people say theyre fine skipping characters but then sht like global passives on limited characters comes out and welp now you have to pull characters you may not like or miss out on a global buff that will improve your entire account no matter what
apokarin im tired of the mentality of why are you complaining its a pve game bruh bitch i pay to pull characters i like i literally support the game i have every right to complain about what i dont like in a product i pay for whether its a one time purchase or a live service
just say things become pay to win
a limited character you can skip
or someone just like the character ever think of that
phoenixdrive people pull characters for multiple reasons trying to strongarm people with fomo by using global passives aint it its almost like a vip system amount spent on global passive characters increases overall strength
phoenixdrive duh ofc if someone like her gonna pull her he saying the one that doesnt like her the players that save their jade for future characters like phainon hyacine etc they dont want castorice but have to pull her for that global passive cuz u dont even need to level castorice up u just need her in your account for the free revive full team now why would u need free revive cuz future boss will shot you like nikador
phoenixdrive heck the new dragon boss makes all your units in your team go to hp balance nah thats how they sell her
i would tell the guy to wink twice if there was a problem but hoyo clearly has the guy as a hostage at point while making this video
aside from new players being able to farm from herta station all way to ampho netting around k jade
if they play for at least a week getting all the pulls from the daily log in the from the anniv rewards and reaching belobog they would atleast have enough for attempt but still it will be rough more so for the casuals who only play an hour a day since they wouldnt have a diverse team and no good relics unless they get very lucky but i doubt it
yue yeah at what cost no shower no grass each patch so far has unskippable dialogue even in the side events since and the events themselves were dogsht especially the museum one
ennryuo aint that what everyone did on lunch lol and you can do half story in weekend alone
yue yeah everyone was blindly eating the sht out of that just to get jades
yue are you sure you can stand the black screen and the many words until the ampho without the skip button if i were a new player i wouldnt be able to stand all that
ennryuo also people bitch about the global passive yes its shit that there might be more in the future but thats future we dont have a single char with global passive for next patches and cast passive aint even good since a decent player can clear all current content with seele pela rmc tingyun speef on pela rmc ting ainy hard with the set bonuses we got now
masriskun eem guess you havent played lol you can skip most content and can go straight to ampho too
yue i would rather do belebog and even xianzho loufu rather than ampho only reason to do it would be to get rmc
ashiqprio true on that xd
i feel like her past will be more balanced if you had to have her on your team for the passive to be activated work if it was like that i dont think no one would be complaining that badly
my friend told me i can get a free ruan mei or luocha she asked me when im coming back to honkai how do i tell her wuthering waves foreva
dude was out of breath the entire video hes got bigger problems than a gacha
i was not here before the bots sorry baldie
the community doesnt want to be saved
video gone private i wonder why
of course castorice global passive not badwho not horny with that character so opez game pay to win
of course it aint i didnt plan on having weak teams that die
wassup baldy
fifth
dont let castorice global passive distract you from the fact that tectone is bald
can someone tell me what is castorice global passive and why its so bad
""
first here
first
i think hes the big problem
the hoyo assassin had a garotte around his throat the whole vid
fr fr
da wai got him
youre telling me hoyo sent evelyn to choke him out
dude is literal mouth breather
he and futurecanoe can be a great team team noenergy
nah that im pretty sure many people would be honestly happy about experiencing the hoyo assassin is a meme from i forgot his name a black dude with glasses and dreadlocks who does various parody skits about genshin and hoyo said cc had in one of his vids parodied hoyo creators where he couldnt speak bad about genshin because there was a hoyo ninja standing in the corner of his room watching
youre talking about cosmos
exactly we can just leave them alone at this point
and is that remind you of other community exactly gi both hsr and gi have the same community
lol i never feel bad about these fanbases
forcodingg it slowly turned to it so now its not good to be in the community i will only keep myself with tectone and whatever he covers otherwise i will not be looking at the community i will play the game and enjoy it on the side
even tectones shiny head cant save them smh
damn was hoping to see him get cooked in the comments lol
was wondering why i couldnt find the original video
whats his channel name
idk why they act like death is a bad thing if youre gonna get your team killed a lot i dont think castorice is enough to save you its easier and more future proof to fix your teams but if you would get frustrated quit over or deaths like you aint supposed to learn anything then just go play animal crossing or some shit
until they add insta death mechanics into the game
you miss the fact that they release content around the characters you didnt need super break until they made content that needed it you didnt need fua until they released content that needed it whats stopping them from releasing content that highly incentives certain global passives
authenticinarifox the easy boss button for story is right there
""
fr
grass is green sky is blue
basically when you pull hereven when not in the team she can revive someone the reason its bad in the communitys eyes is if this is a success then hoyo will make even more op global passives in the future basically making power creep worse plus making it more predatory
the passive on castorice really isnt that bad it just revives a team member that dies and if youre having sustain issues its usually just by not building your sustain correctly or failed a mechanic etc however now that its there the devs can add any passives they want to future characters making power creep worse and worse and making skipping certain characters you might not even want also worse as well since you dont have those passives boosting to your account and lets say you skip every passive eventually the game is going to be balanced around you having a few thats when youre kinda screwed
its some passive that can revive your whole team just from having her on your account which is mid since they get put at hp and can still die right then and there plus you rarely even die and if you do youre trash tbh but the bad thing is that its making everyone overthink and assume the future of hsr being people being forced to pull for someone because of a passive which we dont even know if its gonna happen or if theres a limit to passives you have in a fight
mistycc bros slopping on it
shindy the true reason it is bad is because it is hoyo and the playerbase it has would just keep giving their money to dawei either way and defend this shit practice and since big playerbase big revenue itll appear as a success no matter what to outsiders down the line this enshitification might spread to other gacha either new and old and slowly normalized because these devs especially cash grap ip gachas dev would think gacha players are alright with this shitty system
using another game as an example imagine locking phoenix down or raise spells in a unit
basically we dont trust the devs to not pull bs bc of the passive
honestly i have no problem with sexualisation of characters in games sex should be normalised and yet in its still taboo to talk about which is just silly
yall be talking about gacha pvp let me introduce you to cookie run kingdom the best gacha game to ever gacha
to cut short to people who dont wanna waste their exact hour minutes and seconds of their life the global passive is definitely bad but for pokke its not that bad he claims it should be free but at the end of the day its just a mere free revive so it is still kinda okay to him
its all fun and games until the devs decide to start making content including end game around passives
i dont think the global passive is a big deal when they are kinda giving us a lot of wishes now if this becomes a consistent thing it can become worse
the being a problem i think was a silly critique with it i definitely think this is a solution to having so many characters to where if im going to keep losing to random characters id rather lose to a pool of characters i do want esp copies of genshin standards until i quit ive had them all at c for a very long time some were way over c some at least c or c and id rather have a pity and ways to use my pull cash backs for at least a character i got so pissed when i spent a total of wishes for the latest rapi in nikke and all i got was fucking rapi one i had to use of the coupon vouchers to get more copies it sucked i wanted to save those for collab characters like asuka
all tech companies have sides the developers and the shareholders the latter wants as much revenue as possible and cares about nothing else the former wants to create products which is used and liked by the users the devs give their souls blood and sweat to these games they want us hopefully all of us to enjoy the results of their hard works so they do listen and believe me they want to give more and listen more but they have bosses who care about money and deadlines only about castorice i doubt the global buff will be a trend because none of the upcoming ones have signs of having any but i they do it wont harm the game hi has global buffs left and right and it has little impact also her kind of global passive wont be the standard for those globals because she is an anniversary unit acheron has instant slay and no one else does they did get some useful stuff on their technique but not like hers castorice will also be one of a kind old character buffs are a thing in hi as well in part old characters like super old ones got augment cores you could collect or buy to buff them they didnt become meta but they were very usable as supports for the new characters and each got new skills new moves new look they were not general multilier increases and now eg herrscher of human ego who is liked so is blade and kafka got new life in part with a new weapon which made her compatible with the astral ring system and the new one of that so she can be a support for new upcoming characters it is not a coincidence that the first batch of the buffs will come in blade will likely be able to be a good support for phainon or an alternative right after mydei maybe kafka will go with cypher and seele will go with castorice monetisation its a gacha game they always wanted people to spend lol and in asia people spend so hard some go bankrupt they let you play free games or have free apps on your phone because they want to push you to spend on a consistent basis instead of one big pay it is normal sadly they funnel most of the money into sibling companies like that ai company they have no it doesnt voice things with ai they are doing stuff with bigger impact
why global passive is so bad coz the main problem is not the passive but the main problem is that feature they would give to enemy as well for example in future they make enemy if party have buff from characters is not in the battle field enemy resistance will decrease or enemy will doing less dmg if that come true its will be over for old characters
very glad tectone and smack wasnt a part of this
""
why was fob throwing shade at westerners for being against pay to win
they keep crying about castorice and saying the global passive is predatory they dont know the meaning behind the word they might have had a point if the passive was lock behind her e
i was not going to quit until global passives i was not thinking of quiting at all
this is not what people typically refer to with hoyo spending events hird where that originated for hoyo rewards you for spending currency not money fp can save up when they know one is coming and take full advantage of it as well without spending a dime
speaking of global passive does anyone actually test or quantify the bath mechanic and how much buff it gives since the game goes out of its way to tell you this
you cant run sustainless because you have to be healed or shielded by another character for the revive to work
honestly whats the point of playing this game anymore even genshin needs more strategy than star rail rn and its kinda funny or not
great yap session ngl o starrail for me personally has been fun there are just a lot more issues in hsr than just the powercreep or global passives
it always kinda cracks me up when people make this argument the system was an initial solution to having no guarantee for a unit at all ive heard horror stories about fgo the was an answer to people not liking the and the guaranteed weapon banner in wuwa was a way to get a leg up on the weapon banner hoyo was using now in the case of hsr the new change to the system feels less like a solution to the system and more like a solution to the fact that they have so many limited star units and that there are units who will likely not be able to rotate back in fast enough and they wont be compelling if they received their own rerun banner if a dev chooses to remove the they will without a doubt make it significantly more difficult to hit guaranteed pity wuwa is a perfect example of this they have a guarantee on the weapon but they changed the currency and they only give you limited pulls during the initial portion of the patch that are locked to the character banner this means that any time you roll on the weapon banner it feels like its a pretty big choice and ive personally felt like im incentivized to commit to hitting the weapon this is likely magnified by the star weapons being kinda shit tldr the into was a solution to an old issue in gacha if they move to a guaranteed system we can probably expect pity shifting to something like or less currency
they made sure to spoiler the entire story but didnt have time to explain the stuff we were actually there for
it is in the sense that it forces you to pull a unit that you otherwise may have not planned to
that means high chance other global passives most probably will need a certain threshold for the passives to work
its all fun and games until they bust out speed global passives crit rate global passives effect hit chance global passives or even worse perks that make farming more efficient or whole arse gameplay mechanics this is going to snowball out of control if we allow it to become successful i guarantee it
dont need so many complains about the same thing just leave if you dont like the game
i love cassie global passive
youre not the victim here
tbh the global passive thing is something im okay with there is currently no team in hsr that relies on revives bailus revive is barely useful bailu is just not useful in general and gepards revive isnt needed in his kit either in fact powercrept has slowed down recently therta ofc being very powerful but aglaea has restrictions and so does mydei and when these more balanced characters come out people are quick to complain how to make them op is to spend money i thought we didnt want them to be op acheron is still useful in every piece of content and can do very very well and firefly performs as well as rappa powercreep is not as doomed as yall claim performance also depends on enemies so it still does fluctuate so many people hated on aglaeas e for solving her issue and to make her broken and same goes with mydei so basically they want a non broken character but also want them to be broken make up your mind for those that dont know e aglaea solves her energy issues and e mydei nakes godslayer be god full aoe dont forget the jiaoqiu doomposting when they made him weak and him being outperformed by pela in some cases the community also takes part in this
i dont think strinova died because the learning curve is too high lmao it looks like ass so a lot of people never gave it a chance
fobs right the global passive isnt the end of the game for of people its kinda the straw that broke the camels back for me personally my decline started in and ive kinda replaced hsr in my rotation already but if they improve the story stuff and add end game i care about i could see myself coming back but as is it just kinda feels like a chore more so than fun
eh its just buisness as usual for a hoyo gacha game and its community at least on the western side some people complain and leave the rest play and enjoy there time playing the game the only ones who truly care about the global passives are the endgame players which make up a very small perecentage anyway the rest just play the story and farm for the new shiny char till the time comes to replace them with a newer even more shinier on
uiguy is the true gacha jesus
i cant wait for speedcritattack and continiously debuffing enemies global passives and watch both sides lose their shit
hird also has passives i dont know what perks they give but if its minor then i hope hsr follows that path since its basically its child unless hirds passives are as bad as the speculations made in hsr then welp at least i know the game will take a hard toll
bro if silver wolf ult or e become aoe she going to be crazy
i think the global paasive is something only on anniversary character just like acheron is the only character can skip the battle during the map
ngl its the people that complain about castorice global passive that are gona be the same guys who es her on release
i swear the sweaty gacha community which i am a part of no shade there sometimes talks about these games way too seriously im not saying that to dismiss conversation about it i think this call was pretty insightful im just worried about the people who will get legitimately tilted that global passive or whatever powercreep etc as if hoyoverse walked in and shot their dog it hurts when stuff you like changes in a way that you dislike but theres so many games out now and upcoming ones with such a similar format that you could just drop this and play something else i did it with genshin and eventually i will stop playing hsr and thats okayge
i dont understand the issue tbh if up until now your characters had gooddecent crit ratecrit dmg why being scared that a gp will make it bad if anything itll even be a nice bonus up until now weve seen the worst of the endgame modes actual hp inflation and somehow we still cycle moc and clear pf k so how does adding a few crit dmgcrit rate change this in any way these buffs have been implemented in the game since in one slick way or the other my main example is fucking fuxuan she legit gives you a whole crit rate while sustaining you at the same time while you cant get it while shes off field you get the point
people complaining about castorice as if acheron wasnt a walking delete button in overworld and the herta wasnt a stellar jade finder
i think the main problem people are facing is fear of not being able to clear endgame content hsr endgame is ridiculously easy and everyone is expecting to be able to clear it without premium units does it make a game bad if endgame content isnt fully clearable with minimally invested accounts some people have never played hi or other gacha endgame if you didnt have the unitscomps you didnt clear you just get over it but you could participate and still get rewards your account is fine your game is still playable and enjoyable youll live without and extra jades on a side note its amazing to see how ontopic and fairly rational this is without a certain baldy isnt present let alone i didnt need to adjust my volume
im going to have to say the problem of global passives didnt begin with castorice it began with topazs character technique to find treasure chests and increased currency in the simulated universe then we had ruan meis interaction with the simulated universe then we had acherons instakill enemy encounters she doesnt have to be on your combat team to have this effect castorice is just the first during combat global passive its a bit late to get upset about accountbuffs like this
watching ccs cry about castorice fills me with glee edit on a side note ccs thinking the relic stats are prerolled when you get thr artifact is kinda funny
i mean yeah obviously they tried to make the game more interesting or more appealing honestly thought i dont feel bad at all im getting bored by playing the same team comp with same support
raihansalimnwtm ermno this is purely to fill their pockets and create scenarios where people feel like they have to summon for units that are going to have these thats why its awful for the game
arcadius well thats your opinions hsr is way too simple imo i dont find it enjoyable doing all those side quest farming su for jade or whatever just to pull regular build doing the most boring turn base game ever i remember when i was playing e pve content it was much more enjoyable they make you explore every gear build team finding the right buff and debuff etc thats why i always open for new stuff because i just hope from this they can make the game more interesting like adding abys floor challenge or whatever the first gold su and the swarm su was good the rest was dogshit
raihansalimnwtm no its a fact youre just painfully naive
arcadius in order for something to be considered a fact it must be supported by verifiable evidence and generally accepted as true being an auditor myself being skeptical is a must but what you do here is just baseless accusation on your view and even if what youre saying is true this game company its not some non profit organizationd if you refuse to hear what other people think then you shouldnt commented in the first place
noone cares if you dont like the game just quit youre some grown ass man crying about gacha game
raihansalimnwtm and there is gaming history i know you newbies all started during covid with genshin impact but gaming has existed far longer than that bud weve been through this song and dance countless times fools like you only realize your mistake when its far too late
smasdsee nahh i think ill continue pissing off fanboys like you with valid criticism
you cared enough to respond doofus
arcadius if theres some point when i dont having fun then im just going to quit the game its not that deep its honestly intriguing why people trying to leverage company decision like its some type of investment glad i was born asian i guess edit i saw you have more than coments in this channel i guess it wasnt ethnicity you just a keyboard warrior in where i came from we call you  shbi zh a parents mistake
raihansalimnwtm so you have no retort whatsoever got it
arcadius i mean neither do you all of your comments towards them featured some kind of personal attack lmao
justsomeguy what do i need to retort the argument they dont have
definitely will happen in time cn fanbase is the type that will just accept anything given to them so it will happen
backpackpepelon yep
and people like you are the reason why genshin impact never got better because you dont criticize whats bad about the game
arcadius ahh yes i said dont complain instead right whats the point of complaining now when its ady a thing i get the complains before but now thats global passive is a thing why are those things crying so much about it
carrot thats not what you said doofus youre literally telling people to leave if they dont like what the game is doing
you literally told people to leave if they dont like what the game is doing why are you lying lmao
arcadius they ady made the global passive why hate it so much instead of continuing the complains just leave instead like the ccs yall make it like a gacha game shouldnt have power creep and new abilities
carrot they took too serious into the gaming world into their lives over their heads its their favorite gamethats why the outcry they felt their time is taken for granted then again games are created to die its just a question of when so get a grip its not like you cant pull for characters either it is an option not an obligation honestly hoyoverse didnt even take a knife out and force u to literally pull for that character as a fp no doubt you gotta plan your pulls well you arent going to get all the characters that you wanted the same analogy we cant have all the nice things in life without a cost i seriously question the minds for this outcry on the side note i already saved up pulls just for castorice facebluesmiling
the passive just helping add few score to help raise the rank against player with same comp and skill aside from that it does not have effect
imo the best way i can describe this gp of a thing is its like consuming a food buff but this time it actually follows you into every endgame mode
yeah i dunno why people choose to complain now of all times hoyo makes it that castorice is a must pull even without a global passive i will still pull for her and the gp isnt the thing i sought from her im confused as to why people are getting mad over a global passive now its not even a full revive if you think that with the gp they can go in without a sustainer they are so wrong the kit requires you to get a heal or shield to fully revive else they would get taken down as well after turn i do think gp is the thing that triggers them while the problem they are addressing has been present since vx patch of hsr
acherons global passive is way more important than castorices
gachasmack on aglaea banner made a whole vid glazing casto and telling aglaea was mid and totally not worth stated that casto will be a powerhouse yadda yadda casto arrives is a powerhouse but is shaping to be the most controversial character because of global passive gachasmack i quit hsr bye lol
as a casual player i dont care about castorice global passive not sure how other casuals feel about it
its a pve game not a pvp game who gives a fuck about her global passive
im staying because i like the storylore and herta this is a freaking singleplayer game if they can make more powerful characters then go give me more challenge im still salty about nikador boss killing me so many times i lack sustain characters so thank you castorice for saving my azz soon lol give me aventurine next andor hyacine then im good to go genshin community was all about oh the game is so easy combat sucks meanwhile hsr community game is so hard pw need to pull meta hero to beat the game so like can yall shut up casual players like us dont care why would i play a game with low qual and weak heroes doesnt make sense ps idgaf if you tourists will call me hoyoslave cope harder
guys hsr doesnt have powercreep im serious yall just imagining it
as an obsessive danganronpa fan i appreciate the tribe nine hype
if castorice is the hidden free star then the new global passive mechanic wont become a pw trap however that would literally change the immersion players in the preamphoreus story would either experience it when it shouldnt appear yet if everyone gets it or will lag behind others in terms of completing challenge modes if shes locked behind story progression either way i see nothing good with global passives id rather not think if we have more characters with global passives
fgo anniversary gives pulls and selector dokkan battle gave this year pulls and a selector which included the new anniversary characters massive w imo instead of just having a choice bw blonde guy and ruan mei they shouldve given a choice between all stars before
imo global passives are a good thing but shouldve been locked behind the main story completion instead of locking it behind a character but in general i reaaly dont care about it but i guess its a non west take
idk who bro coming from behind the door is but hes malding hard as fuck the entire time and made this so annoying to watch
fab is so annoying and out of touch he has this superiority complex because he is from china or whatever asain culture he is from and tht mindset that the route that star rail is taking is a non issue because it is only vocalized by the minority is projected onto the rest of the space which is unfair to everyone else
aeon of silently aura farming for of the entire time
finally wuwa add some personality
i cant stand it when ccs act like you should be able to clear endgame content when they are tourists of the game with trash relics
some toxic people will quit hsr and play wuwa comes to wuwa community and toxic there if at the time wuwa dev wont listen to some players suggestion i mean yeah gacha game is also company where there are people who want to make money of course at some time they will make a featured where people forced to pull or spend the money rather if they like it or not
i was away from gacha games for a while bcs of mhwilds also quit one of my gacha daily games bcs of that game now that im back in here in the gacha cc space i realize its nice to see everything stayed the same the narrative ive seen is the same hoyo bad and wuwa is still hailed as the dev listened game and my stance is the same all gacha game is kinda bad these gacha games are the same what matters is which game you actually enjoy and how much bullshit they do you can tolerate
as hoyo will unlikely will change or remove global passive my last hope is they restricted active global passive to only
the short version of the global passive is this one in specific isolated from other things doesnt matter it basically doesnt change the gameplay the problem is with the design space this opens up whats to prevent hoyo from adding a global passive that does matter hell i can totally see them adding one akin to the special abilities we get on some fights and theyll sell it as we heard you you need more depth and more buttons so now you can press t and the enemies go boom like its tnt
ngl at the point where they compare sw to anaxa for the nth time i cant help but wonder if these people know anything about the game and since they dont seem to then idk why should i take any of their takes seriously
easiest conclusion youre not chinese
he is crazy
mans stood on business most of these people cant say the same thing
i honestly dont really care every gacha game is pay to win in my eyes in some way there will be predatory stuff in it
wessie_btw as a casual it is pretty bad ngl all points made are valid but why do ppl act like it killed their whole family in the end of the day its a game i have other stuff to worry about in life
casual player as well here picking up star men characters i dont really care much about castorice but i do understand that others might feel pressured to pull for her because of her pas i do feel the same way with pulling for harmony characters to help support the team though almost all are girls and im collecting men but i just ignore and save up for what i want
you need to use your brain it fundamentally makes the game more predatory than it already is just think you can do it
regarding fgo been playing since day of the jp server so i can tell it took years cant remember exactly how many but probably or before they even gave out a standard selector anniversary stuff never gave limited and the ceiling for a limited is at pulls please never compare hsr to that stupid game regarding the gacha mechanics sure hsr has its flaws but its still infinitely better than fgo fun fact in the beginning fgo pulls didnt even have a guaranteed cost more than now and there was no ceiling for years
xophien i understand everything you say i am a day player in fgo and hsr is far better than it when it comes to summon pity and the frequency of getting stars but even you have to admit that fgo anniversarys are far better than hsr ones
literallyjesus lately they clearly are yeah but i went to check and on fgos second anniversary we only got the equivalent of pulls still talking about jp server dont know if it was the same in global and only because they retroactively increased the rewards from the tutorial otherwise it was just pulls dont get me wrong though id love at least enough pulls for a guaranteed in hsr but unfortunately really popular gacha games are always stingy until their popularity decline like fgo and seeing how genshin is still stingy as hell after years ive lost all hope also its easier to give out pulls when the ceiling is so high since it makes them lose less money in the end
i dont think its toxic to give constructive feedback in fact devs literally ask for this and thank people for it and if any company ever pushes it too far then good on the player for leaving that isnt toxic thats responsible
shit up wuwa shill godofgoblins
idk why people are so worked up over this global passive stuff the game is not a pvp game its a singleplayer gameit wont affect everyone only the one that plays her in my opinioni dont hate nor like itim neutral about this
id like to think that penacony is the end of hsr and everything that comes after is boruto
one of the livestream topic that didnt stick out in the spotlight is the animation the devs said that theyll start putting in character trailers level animation in the game which is a good thing imo almost feels like in hird again
holy content yapenning
this looks to me like a change in hoyos monetization strategy it seems like the silicon valley strategy of building a service that starts of user friendly to gather users then slowly increases costs and clamps down and becomes less user friendly a good example of this is netflix that started with low subscription fees and didnt do much about account sharing however they slowly started to increase the fees and clamped down on stuff like account sharing
you guys are waay too optimistic about the crums we got from this livestream this was litteraly nothing the rewards were nothingpowercrept the story changes are a little too late because they waited for their company to go on fire and the buffs on old units we got no info on that they just droped that they are buffing them to keeps us hooked oh lets not forger castorice haha
people who think castorice global passive is useful in endgame content are just weird theres no way ur gonna ever need that revive lets be real unless you have skill issue you wont have problems with dying the only thing im afraid of is follow up attack type global passives or the ones that buff your stats entirely im pretty sure hoyo knows what theyre doing i wanna believe it they will understand their mistake by themselves they might wanna add extra menu in team customization that lets you choose which global passive to run for each team this menu will be available if you more than character that has global passive
its crazy how oyu can have a normal convo about the game without baldies going schitzo on how genshin ate their cat and stole their wife
i was there when this conversation happened twitch was fine and funny but pokkes youtube livestream chat was so toxic literally even his youtube mods were telling them to bahave but nothing changed
its actually insane that people are defending global passives casual or not it does not make it remotely okay i only play gachas and im very casual when i do play this is not okay for casuals either if i cant get matts do side quests or events because the game is designed to force you to make purchases it is not worth my time same thing applies to literally any purchase and thinking it wont have a big impact is crazy
it is just funny when cc play hoyo games and give good compliment about it while still enjoy wuwa and give good compilment still called hoyo shill soon kuro fans gone become toxic as hoyo fans its just like time bomb or mybe they already it just denial about that
the passive tbh is completely useless especially for casual not only she revives you with hp but also its completely pointless cause casual players plays with sustains so if you die with it its literally skill issue and since she needs a healer regardless the complains are understandable only if youre worried that there will be other global passive that could be better than this onethe passive could be decent for cycles purpose but if the enemy kills you and has a second action for example that hp revives will be useless either wayshes only good vs enemies and in gimmick fights like flame reaverher bosstvand nikador other than that shes an easy skip
future of hsr is just a future with whales probably casual players like me rip
i feel like the castorice passive isnt that bad ussualy if you die its cuz the ai targetted the same character times in a row which rarely happens but if they add something like an hp or attack boost its over
this was fun to experience live because it was fun watching pokke not paying attention while scrolling and laughing at the cn comments while everyone was just yapping about blablabla
as someone eho has played mobile gacha for years ive played mobile games like hsr where players were spending k a day on game i personally had a friend spend k in one day on the game like it was stated earlier its cultural differences global buffs isnt bad at all to be real especially in a single player game
es castorice
to bring up lilys point with reward powercreep dokkan battles th anniversary just allowed us to grab one of the headlining summonable units for free right before implementing a new endgame event that powercrept the rest of the game something that should be counted is that the more generous companies become with rewards the more challenging and engaging the endgame content becomes in order to maintain an increased spending incentive
do not touch my mom cantarella and wuwa the best game ever in my opinion the world is just a masterpiece
those chinese dev yap too much during livestream but they wont yap during sex if you seen most asian porn you know silent af
this is what ive been saying like what this is a story based game not a competitive one its better this way that they just quit and not complaining anymore so annoying
batmanzz because why play the game if not for the story endgame if they are going to ruin the endgame by adding in these pay to win things into the base characters obviously whales are going to be broken then whats the point of it
robertlaidlaw if you think that than the end game is already pay to win as pulling new characters in general makes it easy of content in the game is not pay to win though
it makes the game more predatory than it already is and encourages other gacha games to be even more predatory essentially if they pull this off this leaks into other gacha games easier creating more situations of absurd power creep and must pull situations thus creating more psychological pressure to players to spend more money and companies hope you are oblivious to all of this or make excuses as long as you stay ignorant youre basically spreading your cheeks for them even if you dont spend a dime if you respond with another excuse or dismissal you only further my point just keeping it real
robertlaidlaw the game is already pw
godofgoblins im not saying we should encourage this kind of thing i know its not good for the game and that companies want the moneylike any other company the game is a gachaof course its predatory and every gacha is predatory in their own way after alli like the global buff that castorice has but i wont like it if every character from now on will have a global buffit will be a disaster for the gameeveryone knows thatim not defending the game nor the company btw
whitehollow well you are by saying things like well itsnot a pvp game or well it wont effect anyone you are making excuses for the company you say things like it would be a diaster for the game and everyone knows that no everyone doesnt know that i lost count on how many make excuses and are completely fine with it getting ready to pull for her or saying its completely fine etc basically anytime you say to belittle the situation you are subconsciously spreading your cheeks for these companies its a practice that can and will fundamentally make gacha games even more predatory than usual and you respond with why are people worked up its not pvp that to me comes off as ignorance just keeping it real
the animation does not lag because of it which i like
this is nothing new just take a look at ggz or honkai impact people just didnt listen when warned and continued degenerate behaviour of spending money on es characters
what are you and this cc talking about what changes hoyo actually did examples pls
are the comments being deleted lmao
gerrifuryman global castorice passive spender event duplicate e shop
ninjagaming and where is monetization changes
gerrifuryman monetization strategy not monetization they are making spending more advantageous so people spend more money at the expense of fp and new players especially so a change in monetization compared to when they previously tried to get new players to play and then spend through stuff like the express pass and nameless honor
who fking cares no one who cant spent before will never spent now no one who was buying shit before will stop doing this i cant
i saw someone running double sustain fuxuangal on a jingyuan team for the no character defeated star the other day so yeah people are that skill issue
bop yes and yet somehow during stream everyone in chat was spamming yup im uninstalling hsr like it really does matter for someone
theyre absolutely equally as bad and in denial yea you can tell by the fact a vast majority of them cant even talk about wuwa without also mentioning hoyo it reeks of inferiority complex
lol cringe
looks like harem simulator to me tho
kmzwanabe lol not for me i havent seen a date in the game yet but i would like a date with cantarella she is beautiful
the problem isnt about how strong the passive is its about the fact that more passive like this even more powerful will be coming out soon
the only issue with the global passive is the precident it sets for other characters maybe having a global passive castorices revive is functionally useless for any competant people and also boxs statement on hoyo games only getting worse is just stupid every patch all lf the games get better par genshin because of certain un added mechanics but literally the whole box statmenet was purely based off of genshin and its annoying when people say hoyo as if there arent different teams and team leads working on each game the only time when the game will be woreying is if they add a global passive that increases stats the game gets to the point where these passives are required but there is no proof of any other global passives yet
hsr finally have player on and eos immediately
i think its my time to go back and play real games again the game feels so lifeless nowadays i hope it will get good again any time soon because i used to love this game but now it feels so dry ill stay a little bit for dot revival
imagine dying guys
the thing is with mandarin is a few words can describe a whole chunk of info hence the subtitles fly the way it does
i have no issues with jenazad but why would the convo be lead by someone who already dont enjoy the game and consider quitting already
i wonder what will happen when eus premium currency removal policy takes effect
funny how only hsr and genshin gather this cc what a powerful indeed
im a little concern to continue this game but hopefully in the future patch they will improvise the game especially for those who understands the risk of the global passive as an asian player i felt sorry for the western players that have to reconsider to spending or top up in the game hopefully the devs will listen to all the consumer as they say and they will fixing the system that make the players satisfied from their qol
i think the irony of it is fob saying the minority opinion doesnt matter is the most american thing a person can say fob is the true westerner
i think the point is how often will they pump out global passives if it is once per year like an anniversary unit like castorice i think it is fine since it will give players ample time to prepare for them if the timespan is one or two patch in between the players are pretty cooked it probably also wont do them any good to give the fates collab characters global passive since once theyre gone theyre gone for good i still think its too early to start doomposting but hsr could still course correct by not making global passive units very rare
the first passive ever in hsr is technically acheron acheron is an anniversary character therefore i think that every anniversary character will have a global passive still there are lines one is that you do not change combat values secondly make it balanced castorice passive isnt that bad because any action the character takes makes them die keep this trend going
for me the global passive wont even matter bc i dont suck at the game and can use my brain also single player game lol
goodbye hsr o it was a nice ride
just let sweetily talk facebluesmiling
watch hoyo pull the ultimate dck move by locking a global passive behind eidolons
ccs that are quiting hsr have been waiting to quit for months theyre just using the global passive to make martyrs of themselves
people crying and the game is a single player game
i think it is ok if in each major version only or characters have global passives all global passives will not affect combat values eg crit rate crit dmg only one global passive is activated in a single battle
sometimes we have to atleast one people who not glazing the games
eh but his opinion is already skewed towards the negative before the livestream its better suited to someone neutral only mr pokke is actually glazing here jen pushes so hard on the negatives fob ignores the issue brax or sweetily wouldve been better leading this convo
poliwb well ig youre right
because hes unbearable
also im also get burden because of this powercreep and spending money stuff that doesnt mean im mocking or discriminating the western players i also suffered because of the system
dont wait for that how much they have been saying we will do this in to patches thats just being strung along
in a way hes more western than western ccs
bye tourist
frappuchieno not a tourist played since day one thousands spent was main gacha keep coping pleeb unless you are a new player i congratulate your honeymoon phase
good for them its unhealthy to talk about the game that you already start to hate every single time
this every content creator that is quitting has already been whining about the game for the past few months it is refreshing to see them leave
if global passive wasnt functional in endgame itd be fine thats it moving the goal post is why theyre able to do this
destinystriumph lets be honest here for a second the way castorices passive works it is basically useless unless you have a sustain and its an accidental death or bad rng death i replay the endgame quite often and i can count on my hand how many times that would have actually helped me and going sustainless is basically for very tunned accounts with hundreds of hours invested on it already so its effects is also pretty low if you die and ressurect in a sustainless team something is already missing and its a reset anyway the precedent is the problem but again even if all western players unistalled hsr yesterday they would just stop marketing it in the west and be done with it as the asia market basically is who makes the real money and unless a miracle happens the asian community will not give a shit about it
destinystriumph this characters like ruan mei and the herta technically already has broken global passives in map and su since su was never meant to be balanced and we can switch teams and characters whenever we want if the devs added one line saying castroices passive does not apply in moc pf or apoc it wouldve been fine even somewhat underwhelming its the fact that her global passive affects the endgame content that makes it unfair its basically the devs saying we can implement more broken enemies that will certainly make use of your global passive
only mc should have a global passive since heshe is universal
is a yikes buddy one of the amphoreus characters global passives leaked speed and crit rate
milmil any source i can read chinese and no cn leaker uncle leak that
milmil wait who said that i dont find any leakers uncle said that
limited star saber with global passive skill avalon giving your entire team massive healing per turn calling it now
people complaining about the global passive are ignorant the people who are fearmongering about this having a cascade effect onto other gachas are even more ignorant other gachas already have various bonuses reliant on pulling more characters andor more dupes of characters that impact both direct combat and other important system interactions as well as resource acquisition which is still direct power in many of these games as more resources more resin spent on farming gear stronger characters people who are attributing this as a hoyo special are literally by definition tourists hi brax etc the bonus is nearly irrelevant for a supermajority of the playerbase if you already max star clear the content you still will with or without this if you are struggling to clear content then pulling powerful units to actually use on your teams andor vertically investing into units you already own eg robin ruan mei sunday etc is going to give you more power for pull than this global passive if you arent a whale then gacha games are a resource management sim for even your pulls heres the fun part though if you really think casto global passive is so incredibly broken pull her anyone whos been saving since the announcement of her global passive has the ability as a fp player to guarantee her no one cares if you do or dont like her you dont have to have her on your team so if anything that should be a bonus to you i dont like plenty of the annoying af characters in this game and wish i could remove them from my account but look at that every time i go into my character list sampo is still there ratio if you want a example but i dont mind him gacha games are by definition pw you want to know what else is pw in hsr literally everything from the resources used to build your characters to dupes of your characters and their lcdupes of lcs to we even had packs that let you buy relics via buying the packs with dice in them and such complaining about this specifically when stuff that is generally accepted is way more of a problem such as e vs e performance disparity just makes anyone not addressing all these problems seem ignorant in my opinion the dice packs and such were way more of a problem because yes you had extra resin topoffs via spending but relics still felt like one of the ways that you couldnt just whale to win obv again resin refills kind of fit this bill but it felt less egregious tldr casto passive isnt a big deal anyone losing their mind over it gachasmack who also seems to be confused just like brax about the fact that these systems have always existed in gacha games was just looking for a reason to quit anyway ps i think hsr is in a terrible spot but casto passive has nothing to do with that
what fob said is true regarding asian player but he mentions hok and the stat increase for skin is literally the same with every skin he makes as if its so crazy and gamebreaking lmao
does he even play any other gacha games pretty much in gacha games this has been done long before hsr just take a look at hi for example the divine key system divine keys give bonus passive to all your characters and to get divine keys you have to gacha hsr doesnt have rankings system so i dont think passive would matter much
like guys not to be a hater what jena bracs and smack have in common they all suck up to tectone and are mirroring his schizo mindset where they base their arguments on what the worst thing could happen they didnt even realize before this call that of hsr players do not care about the implications of global passives and people even the smallest mi nority are believing their narrative thats ridiculous we should critize companies for their bad and predatory practices but these loudest ccs are so out of touch besides fob it is insane worrying about future is okay but what all they do is doompost and hate on the hsrnot to defend it here based on their worst imaginary fears
people talk big about being outraged about the global passive at the end of the day sales is what will truly determine hoyoverses decision i somewhat doubt many of these people up in arms doomposting will actually skip castorice because of the global passive which is the biggest way they could speak out or show they dont like it
pokke have managers is he even a gamer or just an actor
fob is such a goat lmaoo
remember dont be greedy and stupid dawei needs his new th mansion
honestly super sad to see ppl exaggerate this people who only play hoyo games have no idea how bad diablo immortal is wartune and like other gacha games its like ppl who always get star steak complain that the steak might come with side orders that dont effect the game in any meaningful way but they exist all they talked about is speculation and acting like their single player game might allow ppl who already e all characters might get worthless global passive
saying that hoyo created the problem isnt doing them justice cus the problem we had before was that there was absolutely no guarantee that you would get anything
stopping people from dying is fine its just that hopefully only this type of passive gets added
no way jenezed thinks nobody wants seele blade or fu xuan they are adding to it too they are just the beginning lol
you guys do not understand how good global passive is my co workers are so happy when i told them because now i can safely autoplay right i hope they add something like followup even when character is not there so i can clear boss faster
they never would have given anaxa the global passive because he is male and people would be angry that a male is a must pull it only works because it is a female but now that the box is open i hope for future gremlins and males to all have global passive so the waifu puller understand why it was stupid to support glbal passive d
the thing is people can trashtalk genshin but a star in genshin is much more worth then a star in hsr so it really doesnt matter if i can get blade or seele or luocha if they arent good anymore
global passive wouldnt be that much of a problem if they just prevented it from being active in endgame content and if devs really want it make it so castorice has to be on one of your two teams
penacony was overmarketed compared to the current anniversary so it is understandable that the hype of hsr this year feels lower hsr management could have reserved the marketing funds for fate this year also no da wei
who cares for fuxuan seele or blade at this point i rather lose to himeko
bro i swear to god i thought box was agsu and i swear to god i was bouta lose my shit
smack really be farming at this point ngl
viabhavgulati this is literally not about how good that passive is its the fact that they ignored all feedback and added it and will do it again plus this has nothing to do with other games because we arent playing those games idk why youre comparing
so if the passive as bad as you say why tie it to a character and not make it global for everyone
proof i want proof name gacha games that has global passive characters the passive effect itself isnt the issue its global passives and what it means for the future of the game no one but hardcore players care about endgame most in my opinion are casuals bet max clear moc with characters if you think having a free time revive per fight for all your current and future teams is incredibly broken pull her wdym if you think they announced her full kit yesterday idk why you think a fp player can guarantee jade pull her with a days heads up fp players can pull one star every patch if they lucky or every other patch if not okay let me get this straight so your saying gacha games are pw but creators that dont address these problems pw elements in a gacha pw game are ignorant bruh its a free to play game of course the monetization is egregious that doesnt mean its okay to add another manipulate practice also an e character are powercrept by newer unit every patch global passives are a boon your your entire account forever tldr this is not for the benefit of the player and we all need to push back on it beause you aka the player deserve better
they hate castorice and get jealous because she got global buff than their favorite waifu
aaaldivrfe a lot hate hoyo setting the precedent not necessarily the character itself even those that like castorice like rcastoricemains are skeptical because a global accountboosting passive could very well end up on a character that people dont like in order for hoyo to boost those banner sales its just a bad precedent to set
fredxu global buff is not necessarily needed if we can clear content without global buff then whats the problem global buff doesnt lock certain content
this makes it kinda scuffed then cuz sales data will be skewed from the top up event
aaaldivrfe when they start balancing around it it becomes a problem too early to tell atm of course and sure castorices isnt needed to clear the endgame but we said the same thing about pocket supports and signature lightcones and eidolons and now the games content is pushing a difficulty level that starts to demand those things
aaaldivrfe the thing if its not a problem why make it global or why tie it to a character they could make it when she is in the team or give it to everyone not people that have castorice being tie to a character makes it fomo so people have to pay to get a character they may even not like
its his job tho if he doesnt have manager how tf he will do with all these guides and stuff
hes a streamer
btw saying hoyo games only downgrade sounds absolutely crazy to me hsr was much better than zz is much better than when it launched even genshin is getting a little better recently though it probably couldnt be worse with and the style shift in
spirit_nightingale all these gacha cc and players are not gacha players they play hoyo game and call themselves gacha player like for real if they remove but guarantee still at pulls would that make it better should not be the focus but the pull income and how many characters you need to play the game
kurniawandelima these gacha players have never played pjsk
yep they should add a global passive that allows you to skip the battle entirely
komodo you gonna be surprised by the real casual that spend a lot of money on it in asia you can see a lot of ppl play hsr on train or at work do that happen in the west
komodo coughx zz already have that
komodo they already did its the thing called acheron
i mean this isnt must pull either the passive is pretty useless outside of making sustainless cycle ever so slightly easier since i absolutely do not want to pull hyacine im leaning towards skipping cas shell not stay long in the meta anyways with her bis team releasing back to back and being an hp scaler and im sure cyrene in or so can be used for others as well if its a rmc upgrade
waifu puller still wouldnt care
doughnaught i deeply hope waifu pullers skip a must pull because of stupid balance and cant clear to get jades for the next cycle of must pull waifus
doughnaught oh in cn they would care hoyo is terrified of making good male characters because everytime they do cn starts crying that they now have to pull for a male character
nah its cuz hes not phainon if phainon is bricked then yeah male characters will always be bricked
what lmao
atleast hsr is not locking exploration behind characters
ayushkcvx such a bad take
tenthofchaos its not a bad take its facts
ayushkcvx explain
tenthofchaos what is there to explain
ayushkcvx explain how its not a bad thing
ayushkcvx well that isnt happening why are making shit up
ayushkcvx u dont need the mary sue to climb or jump in genshin lmao
cosmicsongstress i think you dont play genshin cuz exploring some parts are a real pain unless you have certain characters
i dont think you can even do it well on end game content especially with bosses like hoolay or nikador who have aoes and high speed you need to get healed or shielded for the character to get back on their feet and get their hp back
fuxuan is really good though
dont cry that it is ending smile that it happened
hoyo has already done global passives hi has them some are grindable and some are gacha all of them are pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things and they are not required for endgame
mr pokke exposed fake gacha player
i think this is something that should be shamed and no content creator should be covering this game anymore the community needs to let this game die now as they cant change it when it goes live due to laws if it doesnt expect this even to come to wuwa and maybe tweaked for slight praise but still predatory
i dont think it is accurate to theorize hoyoverse skipped quickly past the global passive because too few people care hoyo is being very cautious with the global passive they didnt address it in detail they put it on a character that will already be pulled instead of anaxa where it would be more obvious and they didnt make it a very strong passive if they are confident there will be absolutely no backlash then why be so conservative in how they add it its the same argument with them buffing older characters kafka and jingliu are popular waifu characters sure who are these casual silver wolf mains who were wanting a buff where are these casual blade mains who are somehow in touch enough to know their character needs a buff but disconnected enough to not recognize a global passive problem if you want to treat casuals as truly braindead swipers who couldnt care less then the only changes hoyo should be making are the story changes any combat or meta changes truly shouldnt matter casuals will just always buy the new characters and there wouldnt be a need to buff the old ones
i dont know why people complaining this is a single player game you dont compete with anyone global passive means nothing
if you play long enough having to spend extra cycles to clear endgame content because u dont have a broken global passive we arent even there yet all this drama over a revive passive sheesh isnt a big deal the loud ones are probably the ones who just barely get stars or believe you need the latest character to beat everything at the end of the day they will still make the newest characters best suited for the most recently released content but it doesnt mean you need them youll eventually pull a character with a global passive down the line if you keep playing cant believe some people are using the global passive as a reason to be mad at the free anniversary jades and tickets you cant fool us into not complaining anout the global passives they say when they give us this reward every anniversary
at this point people are already forgot acheron game breaking ability
if one considers leaving the game because of the developers decision to make changes in their game do yourself a favour and leave this is not the attitute you have when enjoying a video game
the problem isnt this one single global passive the problem is its a precedent for hoyo and others that could ruin many games in the long run
guys im from the future cipher gives you stellar jades per day as global phainon generates extra stamina per day cyrene will give you a crit dmg buff as global passive saber will give you atk as global passive archer will give you hp as global passive
the problem with this exchange shop shit is theyre just gonna add units that are long obsolete into the shop we are given luocha who has been dead since fxaventurine or ruanmei whose niches have all been powercrept besides weakness break efficiency both are also early x characters by the time someone useful like robin or sunday hits the shop theyre going to release an emanator of harmony that advance forwards the entire team times with res pen
im about to get castorice since i lost on tribbie and im out
global passive means more global passives in the future evenif kit game breaking they might apply gamebreaking ones especially its hoyo testing new mechanics means theyll over do it in the future and a lot more enhanced and a lot stronger with a catch ex powerful e and e signature lightcones only good for its respective unit more powerful gamebreaking units means harder enemies and hp inflation whuch means older units sucks ahh older units sucks ahh means forcing you to pull newer unit even if you like them or not in conclusion hoyo games arent for casuals and fp in the future even rn ngl unless you got lucky which means be a gambler and spend more money
just like mr pokke said we are basically taking out the trash to players complaining about powercreep
people keep afraid of global passive will not be a one time thing and will spread more in the future but just look at kafka she still the only dot enabler in the entire game yes that not a really fair comparison but the point i want to make is character uniqueness can be preserve instead of looking castorices global as a new system why dont we just think of it as her own originality
who is we
reminder that you shouldnt base your opinions on how ccs or random internet users think play the game or dont
nikkie is not a gooner game how cause u cant straight up fk the characters oh waitu cancanonicallymultiple times hows fob spitting hot ass like this but then saying i like varesa pick a side broare u based or not lol
i dont think if its a good idea to say to buff olders characters while putting some on perma why would you make efforts to make them even viable when they probably wont give you a penny anymore
seethe for they are taking it from you
nothing is ending
literally been saying this its not even new for them there older games been had them just people dont play there games
i dont play hird could you name me some examples of global passives on this game just to get a glimpse of how effective they are
atk per divine key is not the same do you even play hi and many of the trash powercrept keys are rather easy to get from free rewards you can grind for better buffs like fire dmg but this doesnt even come close to a unique effect rather than slightly more damage
many of the passives are flat hp or flat defense which is utterly useless flat attack per key is a drop in the bucket as for the slightly stonger elemental damage buffs they will maybe give you a second faster clear if you even bother turning them on which i usually dont just like the castorice buff if you have proper teams with proper builds it wont matter if you have it or not and if you have shit teams with shit builds the globals wont make enough of a difference to matter
karnage st hi has rankings and they have brackets if you are casual maybe in rd brackets the passive wont matter much basically the passives are stat boost like fire atk boost sp boost etc
karnage the difference in performance between the guy who has all global passives and who dont less than
the difference is you dont have to pull a character to get the global passive in hi and also people just accepted that their valks in hi will one day get powercrept so none of that matters to them
you do have to gacha them esp when they st came out you could say the same with hsr maybe in the future castorice will be added in the list of pool and then you dont have to pull
you have no fucking idea what youre talking about what laws what wuwa adaptation what letting the game die we are the vast minority of the games playerbase if all of us quit today nothing changes for them you just gotta realise this stuff isnt directed at you so maybe instead of trying to ruin the fun for everybody else you might wanna look into your own issues and just quit the game
the idea of global passives has been done in gacha for plus years
cordneyrobinson so this makes anything what i said different
mtmartian yea the idea that a global buff will kill a game is crazy when there are games with these buffs going strong its also disingenuous to think that the global buffs will effect gameplay massively and that the game will be designed around them when they havent designed the game around having es characters and thinking omg this will effect wuwa is also just crazy talk when like i said global buffs been a thing in these type of games for plus years
cordneyrobinson i never said the game will die i said the community needs to let the game die so it doesnt come to other games which it is wishful thinking to not think it will if proven to be financially successful wuwa i think will try to tweak it a bit to make the community happier potentially but i dont see how this remotely will help the community you are throwing a lot of accusations around when you are saying nothing to actually give proof this wont happen especially since hoyo has already proven time and time again where their bottomline is if you really are just so defensive about this just quit you will be happier since you wont have to defend anything
mtmartian the proof is that hoyo isnt the first to do this there are a number of games that predate hoyos existence that do this so saying that wuwa is waiting to see if its financially good doesnt makes sense in fact the reason they are doing it because data shows that it is financially good based on data from other games in the genre over the years im not making any accusations per say im just merely pointing out that global buffs not new to gacha space its bringing implemented based on data from other games that have done it in the space of course they will put there twist on it but concept as a whole isnt new hoyo doing this wont change others games because again this isnt a new concept its been done in other games if you play any of the pvp based gachas you will realize how insignificant it is in the grand scheme of things ive played with players that were spending k a week had a friend spend k in a sitting so my point is these global buffs will never hit predatory level at least to the standard of predatory that these eastern cultures spend on game so if you play any gacha and the company is based in east this kind of practice will be the rule not the exception
cordneyrobinson you are trying so hard to defend the global buffs and hoyo who cares if other games have done it before the vast majority of them dont do it for a reason any that have them i will refuse to play so have fun whaling i guess cant wait for hsr to get pvp so it becomes even more whaling intensive trying to say it is financially lucrative when hoyo never needed to do this before and now they decide to do this i find an odd argument they are choosing to try and squeeze the life out of the players continuing to play the game because the game is on a downward trend it isnt going to be good for them long term it benefits no one i really dont care if the east has a spending problem and they eat up this predatory nonsense doesnt mean everyone outside the east just has to like it kuro has shown to try and take some thing and implement them better i dont believe it is a genshin knockoff like people like to say but i think if they somehow frame it in a way that a stupid person thinks it is smart they will go for it if wuwa was released first it would be in the exact situation hoyo is in honestly
mtmartian the vast majority do lmao u just havent been around long hoyo was one of the first gacha to have a pity system and a system they have improved the space in that aspect before you could spend and get no star characters im not mindlessly defending them im just using critical thinking and global buffs operate on the same premise as edilons moc isnt designed around es characters so why should moc all of a sudden be based around global buffs percent of this is just fomo you mentioned they are trying to squeeze the life out of the players how its not like you have to pull i havent pulled in months and still clear everything and i have a fp with only standard star and i still clear so even the idea that this global buffs is gonna break the game or make you spend is insane you as a avg player are not meant to have every new character and the game is designed in that way if you want every character then you arent a avg player you are a spender because its ridiculous to think you will get every star for free and as a fp it ridiculous to try and build a lot of different characters and teams you should be picking you two dps and vertically build as a fp alot of the problem in this game come from rss mismanagement and poor pull choices i personally havent spent since fei first dropped and i still cycle both sides with acheron and fei but these are my only two teams and dps and ive vertical in vested in them
mtmartian i do agree if the gameplay suffers from it then it will be a problem but they havent done anything to suggest that because the game is still designed to be beat by e variants of units and the end game isnt built for the e variants even tho the buffs are there and available to everyone there track record shows they will still make everything clearable for a e player because the game has to be beatable no matter when someone starts playing so they cant even design the game around buffs like that because the barrier of entry alot of the fear comes from fomo cuz no one wants to miss out or feel like others have advantages over another thats why e players get killed for being unrelatable rather than being like oh snap u got the e cool lol
that is great you can clear it fp but leaks are suggesting the fate collabs will also have global passives and they will probably have another before also what happens in will they have two global passives what if they design an enemy that kills you outright to make the castorice passive mandatory in moc this is not a fp thing at all and they also are having a spending event to promote spending they are clearly telling you who this is for not everyone is lucky in this game so they wont be able to get everything it just sets a bad precedent what happens in when your vertical invested dps units are useless because power creep is increasing at a fast rate i also still dont understand why you think just because a different game does it that all of a sudden makes me wrong a few games can be wrong at once i have played a lot of gachas as well and none of them have had it if you played the more predatory ones hey congrats on promoting their practice more and more to give star rail ideas
mtmartian so we are more or less on same page it really just comes down to how they handle it ive played games its been really good and games its been horrible as long as moc and the other end game modes dont require the global passives but just make it easier then it really wont effect anything but like you said if they make enemies directly make u need a global passive to complete it will be predatory so it really depends how it goes going forward if its tame like percent here percent there things like that it wont be game breaking we will have to wait and see how it is handled and how they handle old units buffs we can make a judgement after a few moc and see if her passive changed anything
cordneyrobinson if you see it that way it is fine but to me the game has fell off after act of penaconny so i was already losing interest to me what the game does now regardless doesnt matter with the implementation of global passives just sucks how much i enjoyed the game a year ago and just hasnt really grabbed me since i honestly find genshin a better game right now in like every way funnily enough i might come back in a year to check it out like i do with feh and afk journey but honestly this game pissed me off more than both of those games did so might be longer or not at all
mtmartian i absolutely agree i did not enjoy penacony and amp is lackluster i dont feel the need to play story like i used to the lack of voice acting and cutscenes is ridiculous and all the quest feel dry i think they need to come up with some more game modes and introduce a new cast of stars ive already stopped spending just waiting to see how stuff shake out with old units buffs cuz i wanna use jingliu and blade more often
thats because fob is slightly and it is kinda slight wrong with his china narrative its true that the passive isnt inherently a big deal on cn though some do have an issue with the global passive powercreep has become something of an issue there they dont like how hard endgame is getting at its current rate and how quickly units are becoming worthless yes they have a much higher tolerance for pw and powercreep than over here but its still just a tolerance theres still a limit and hoyo is kinda starting to push it how much more they can push it remains to be seen but given the other issues hsr currently has i imagine its not much more there have been many story complaints too which is probably why theres the update
chinese fanbase is quite easily appeased or controlled compared to global audiences they are used to that living standards so hoyo is slowly making them accepting must pull units for hsr they know chinese fanbase will bow down in time if they drip this kind of characters slowly
exactly
the issue isnt competition it simplifies down to two big problems one it makes people to pull for characters outside of their actual appeal as a gacha character yeah meta pulling in gacha is a losing game but it doesnt make it any less scummy two endgame will be balanced around global passives as they slowly stack up itll screw over everyone who likes characters who arent shilled with passives
people seems struggle against ai
justapotbro thats intellectually dishonest to say it will be based around global passives when the game isnt based around edilon buffs which is essentially the same thing
cordneyrobinson its also dishonest to compare a feature included in the base kit of a character that applies to all modes even when theyre not on the team at the very least eidolons are only active when you use the character
justapotbro thats a cop out and u know it acheron kills over world herta finds chest units have global buffs already in a sense a revive changes literally nothing this is just doom posting and fomo
cordneyrobinson if castorice passive worked everywhere beside the end game content no one would complain the character you named make overworld experience better they could also made castorice that having her make you dont randomly die fighting mobs but she works everywhere as long as you have her on your account and you may argue its not that big it doesnt help but lets say its true than that more reason to make it not work in end game content since it doesnt do anything anyways
cordneyrobinson wtf overworld kills just save time and chest finding just saves you from using yt thats not comparable to a permanent endgame content buff at all
justapotbro did you think castorice global buff will save you from endgame content no if you die you still losing stars
justapotbro and all revive saves u is a restart so u see how ridiculous it is to be worried about such min buff
spending extra cycles is having to deal with something that didnt exist before the only reason to add them in is for more fomo and it in no way is an overall positive for the player why should anyone be cool with something that randomly negatively affects them for no gain they are just laying the ground work for shit thats going to erode whatever semblance of game balance was left its lame man makes the game less fun
are these dreams or are you just trolling lmao
i hate how i can imagine this happening in the future maybe not the stellar jades unless hoyo is a goblin but it is possible its even more of a f you in the face if they only make it exclusively to limited characters at least give it to every single character
schifferthend youre the kind of person who would be fooled by a tunnel painted onto a wall
definitely not the stellar jades lmao
cultureaddct he is joking
cultureaddct hes just trolling but its pretty close imo
hhehhe the jades and the stamina are the only ones where im like alright lets simmer down lmao but i did hear the collab units had global passives and the other ones seem realistic
just exaggeration but if you spend pulls for cipher it would take years to earn them back from per day i just made them up nothing in particular would hate it if they actually go this direction
what about the moc hp inflation did they listen
zap pretty sure all of the other global passives people had dreams about were proved to not be legitimate dreams
bro is a history fictionologist
damnby looking all these responds they literally highschooler who take anything serious
stellar jades in a year enough for pulls
blues two purples
cultureaddct as of this morning there is no indication that there is any other passive so far
thescorbunny will be more once you go down this road and players accepted it theres zero reason for them to stop doing it for more profits capitalism demands it
luocha is coming back thanks to castorice ruan mei is still a very good generalist support
salientspeaker thanks to mydei i was able to use him again
yes but you can still use those old characters to clear so its a net positive to get them without going out of your way you can focus on pulling new characters instead of always getting stressed over the reruns
this comment are clearly people who are fomo ruan mei can be viable with castorice team luocha is good for mydei
they didnt increase hp to keep up with powercreep they increased it to force everyone to get eidolonssignature lc or pull new meta character to keep up powercreep has existed before and it doesnt hit us as hard it is until recently firefly acheron casually clears within cycles and suddenly it took them cycles to clear
actually i am curious about the game for fp that means what is the borderline of the fp game
kimoboom okay im return player and fp for hsrfor this issue is just dont buff monsterthen it is all good and for me fp game you can look at limbus company
yeah theyre all dumb as bricks lol
same goes for the opposite dont act like the game is above criticizing and dont attack ccs or random internet users because of their opinion discuss things like a normal human being or get off social media
inco_grapha exactly either or you should base your own off of yourself whether positively or negatively
preach
fobs opinion most of the time comes from someone who is to far gone to be argued with he is straight up stupid
when you are in a mindless consoomer competition but your opponent is fob
castorices global passive is a whatever it doesnt change much however my worry is when global passives start stacking which could be very dangerous i really hope they limit to just per team or exclude it entirely from endgame i think that would fix some issues i have my doubts but one can hope
global passive doesnt matter because hsr has been powercreeping since last year and all your yapping changed nothing so why complain more did yall not play genshin
people that think that they are special or important spamming that they are quitting is really annoying im going to start to call it american make honkai star rail great again serious yeah global passive can be a problem but i dont care lmao they are giving more free stuff fixing story and etc btw i want more content too and the new game mode but i can wait lol im playing like other games
people are trying to be soy rebels for some revolution in gacha game
does people cant see whats happening after they quit genshin and all those melanin drama genshin still thrive and do what they always did like nothing happened lmao they dont care about fps and some whales opinion as long as the majority of the eastern players and their giga whale fanboy happy those giga whales fund hoyo like at least of their revenue what does the other source of income do for them if they quit nothing but hey im not against the rebel or people stating their opinion its just i find it funny when people dramatize their decision to quit like its some kind of political vote that your well being depends on it just quit bro hoyo will change only if their giga whale fanboy finally converts to kuro giga whale fanboy
we killing or potentially making its life shorter the game with this one
way too sanitised to shit at this point cuz of having bad gacha before tot whatever it is i keep knowledge of whats happening but im already used to this stuff so im just gonna chill and play like usual enjoy stuff when its cool and thats it lol
global passive aside which is dog shit this might be the worst anniversary livestream ive ever seen
this kind of gives a always save up for anniversary patch morale of story vibe
theres nothing we can do for the game nor the industry just quit the whole genre for your own good or accept the new tier of monetization but remember folks games used to be designed in the interest of the player being fun for being games now theyre just made to incentivize you to spend for every little thing that might feel good in its own right but ultimately youre only serving their purpose theyre not serving yours nor even having a fair exchange youre just being milked unapologetically as hard as possible
eh as long as passives arent account wide stat buffs i dont care extra creditsmaterialssudu buffs its fine
the dream ive had about hsr is memo sprite jingyuan and fire kafka
was soo hard to keep up with powercreep and global buff hit the final nail for me left hsr when i heared leakers talking about global buff sht and now i am living stress free life best decision of my life
its not because of the global passives but im realizing that this game isnt for me the game is way too casual with an apparent casual community who is better off without exhibitionists like myself i have quit because the game is too easy with nothing to do luckily i started marvel rivals and already climbed to plat in a week of starting i forget how fun online pvp games were
this entire debate made the people complaining pretty much cannon in the lore as the mourning actors and hoyo as the ipc without the military power
gigazad at it again
are people really complaining that they got spoiled on a story they havent gone through in almost weeks especially when they do story recap in every livestream so its nothing new
at this point jenazad shouldve just uploaded this since he was the actual one who was leading the conversation
imagine future character having a res pen or atkhp global passive haha of course that would never happend
the passive works even if the character is not in the party its also doesnt matter if you use a different team
harzinlolz i think you need to reread what i said i know how it works what i meant is it could be dangerous when the passives start stacking and limiting active global passives so they dont start stacking on top of each other
definitelynotahedgehog you see your fatal flaw was thinking that the guy replying has a skill called reading comprehension when in reality its an ultra rare ss tier skill that only the advanced humans have also yeah honestly id be fine with global passives if they give one to every limited star and make it so you can only have enabled at a time but since its literally just castorice its just a display of favoritism on a level hoyo has never gone to before
definitelynotahedgehog i agree the passive effect is meh at best and they could literally put global passives tied to content progression like for example hp by completing space station def by completing belobog atk by completing ambrosial arbor crit rate by defeating phantylia etc instead they made it in the worst possible way with the shittiest effect possible
djohnthesalty for now we can safely say that global passives would only be given to anniversary char which is castorice lets be honest here hoyo lives waifus than husbandos so only the female will get very special treatment so if we only gt one global passive every year it changes nothing here
djohnthesalty for now the passive is fine still bad that it exists we just have to wait what hoyo will do when the second global passive drops if any of those become stat buffs that would be really bad
they have displayed high levels of favouritism before castorice but now they are just breaking the games logic i truly think people should stop thinking the skill is fine the problem is the future because the whole point of the god daam game is that at the very least the characters has to be an active member to activate its ability acheron herself came with a fucking skip battle button that to this day works perfectly fine i dont like that they did that to this day but at least they gave it a limitation that she has to be in the team and it doesnt function on elites castorice has a total of limitions the only thing stopping it being that you need heals or shields wich is something all endgame teams will have outside of cycles its fucking abysmal
how would that even work they would need to implement a new ui to toggle which global passive they havent even gotten to artifact load outs
salientspeaker watch them implement it to phainon cyrene and the fate collab characters
male_ficent phainon is a no you know hoyo loves to gives these to waifus cyrene is a stretch fate chars is a possibility but unknown for now
moc already doesnt count stars when castorice passive activates because the game thinks someone died so it doesnt give you star
yeah one or arznt really a problem of them but if all the upcoming important amphorieus characters have one it might become quite a differance compared to an account that doenst have all of those characters
imagine theyll just release crit rate atk crit dmg increase global passive on phainon when he arrives
those things youre asking for werent present in the beta for castorice so i wouldnt hold hope for hoyo to do the right thing
phainon probably will have crit rate global buff and there will be another one later since hoyo gonna make characters with global buff for each new region after this
think deeper kids if whales with global passives on patch x start clearing content too easily they will get bored and stop pulling for more globals reverting back to fp mindset of non metachasing and just pulling chars they like hoyoverse is a company that has gone public to please each and everyone demand revenue should not have an inbound drop decrease they need to keep selling now if the game cannot readjust down old chars and their skills they will likely just toughen up and make stages in moc etc harder now the fp and light spenders will be d one having a hardtime to star their usual moc pf as and they will face a decrease in free jades acquired
so called powercreeping has slowed down a lot new chars are not stronger than yunli in or rappa in castorice is not stronger than the herta as well
the fuck are you yapping about
not the masculine spender
so youre the chad shills then lmao
i think the genshin year so wishes of appreciation is far worse that came with the special program
totgodofwar i said that ive ever seen i dont play genshin so i dont watch their livestreams
totgodofwar that wasnt anniversaryyall also just misconstrued what they said but whatever
cultureaddct the scenario theyre mentioning wasnt even during anniversary is the funniest thing
justsomeguy yeah you are correct that genshin situation happened during the special program
you dont need to and if you feel that way take a step back and think about what type of game it is single player gacha
castorices global passive is account wide
harzinlolz it is and its also almost entirely useless what theyre talking about is a global passive that provides damage boost or something and works in all content
true if they release like a global passive that gives like credits on assignments or simulated universe i will be like so this is the global passive that u guys complain about
ok so what happens if more characters with global passives are introduced they will probably stack with each other that is the problem not that one is ok its that multiple are not
harzinlolz its literally useless
ok by itself sure but i am not talk about if a global passive appears once i am saying if more then one character gets them
harzinlolz we dont know anything about that yet so lets not look too much into the future
ight when it happens dont be mad or saying you didnt see it coming
harzinlolz i am genuinely playing hsr for the story and lore endgame is not my top priority like even i cant clear moc its fine it is just jades so it wont bother me as much
ayushkcvx you say its useless lets say it is than why have it in the first place they could have made it so only worked when castorice is in the team or only works outside of pfmocapo its useless anyways right and i guarantee no one would have complained if that was the case there is a reason they not doing that and they decided to make it global
mlg well i agree with that all of this could have been avoided if it just worked in over world and su
yay
u said u quit and yet u still look for hsr leaks
jawbonedis lmao what maybe you need to read entire comment slowly bro guess you are too fast to read and skipped something and jumped on me for thing that didnt happen
bro was stressing out with a anime gacha game bruh
skitteronline left hsr when heared i heared leakers talking about global buff sht this is what u said bro tell me where am i wrong no matter what u heard or seen u still look at leaks
jawbonedis lmao are you serious i typed i left and not i am leaving why would someone look for leaks one they done with something guess you wana be a nice hoyoshill and defend daddy hsr xd good luck with that or maybe you just want a target to get your inner anger thrown at well whatever it is you need to calm down and learn to read before making any claims rushing is not good you know xd it makes you look fool
mirei yeah bro it was stressy situation it was my st turn based game and loved this concept but was hard to clear stuff with es overtime it felt like its job to get all possible currency i felt like need to replace experienced guy with newcomers freshers so that way a business owner can earn big with less spending xd this was example for pulling new unit every patch to clear all content without worrying about any strategy planning
skitteronline bruh you play genshin wuwa and zz too it is not stress free life at all lmao
yeah i can agree with you on this matter xd but hey now days i just log in for min do the dailies and off to play escape from tarkov oh i absolutely in love with escape from tarkov i just started playing gacha games like year ago i still love some of them but i found eft now xd escape from takov just wont let me play other games for long
nice for snowflakes
so good luck skill issue man so hard powercreep where serval hypercarry pack can pass nikador in like cycles with only one star char in the team
fr the story loss my interest after the end of penacony so the only enjoyment comes from endgame resets tbh mins of content every weeks is not worth it to me i just started marvel rivals too coming from someone who grew up on cod halo and lol i dont know how i ended up ever liking a gacha game its so refreshing again to play a game where meta and strategy actually matters
wuwa is the best place for us
it is a casual games bro i mean its not wrong if you quit cause you dont like pve and going to pvp
afk_idle i wouldnt mind it if there was more end game content that was challenging and difficult resets are every weeks for mins of playtime i could care less about the disney events story etc so thats why i quit not bc of pve
when i feel like playing something simple just hop on hsr when i want some adrenaline i play phasmo and cod with friends lol its not that deep just play depending on your mood
this game is a cake walk even for fp but i think its a waste of time even logging in to use stamina when there is nothing to do a mundane chore i wanted to log in only for moc as and pf resets but i dont find it rewarding to upkeep my account everyday just to clear
yall said this game is ez but i wonder why so many people say moc is hardim not one of them tho
probably because the community is very casual im not a sweat but im not unaware of what i do also people that think it is easy may not need to say anything compared to the complainer who cant clear this community is very unreceptive to help too they rather just complain
squishdapeepo im also a casual i dont pull for op male like sunday or aventurine and i still clear end game by pulling eidolons or lc there are just so much way to clear endgames but yeah human never statisfied and they always complain
and then you get the enigmata and elation stirring the pot further
grayewicked history fictionologists spreading misinformation while masked fools laughing at everybody am literlally a masked fool lmaooo
the true neutral man
i think its fair to not want spoilers in the stream a lot of people join the livestreams in order to see the new characters and content even when they havent finished the story i for example started the game a few months ago and am nearing the end of penacony but still want to see the anniversary events without spoilers
twitter reddit or the hoyo site is gonna be the best options for spoiler free news
zagreus then you can simply look on the website where it has all the info
he doesnt upload much unfortunately he streams a lot tho and has a decent number of concurrents
you never know hoyo can probably pull it off
you know theres a huge gap between atkhp and res pen right
atkhp lets be honest it fucking useless if they really wanna powercreep global passives they should at least make it
well theres no information from dataminers or leakers to even suggest that and that would probably upset a lot of the community in japan and china yes china is mroe accepting of thsoe things from what i understand its a mixed bag there as well with most being indifferent to the passive for now because its not a big deal however the next anniversary unit might have one and the question becomes what type of passive is it and what does it do etc
emanuel im just providing an example for what the future could hold x follow up damage increase x increase in additional dmg x dmg reduction x energy regen increase etc they are small buffs but they add up overtime this is the problem
ayayato_ thats true but i think its will never all at once theres will be limit to active ones unless as u said in future this might broke the game
devlykt i have a feeling that global passives will stack as characters are released which can be bad depend on how strong and how many characters get global passives
certainly its a bad thing and i hope that devs will limit number of active ones so u can atleast have somewhat balance because if they will do endgame difficility based on passives that exist it would ruin balance so badly
oh i forgot the character might not even need to be in a party to trigger the global passive you just have to own them
jawbonedis no thats dumb the whole point of the global passives is that theres tons of them so you dont shove on one unit you have spread across
this wont happen
devlykt yeah ruined balance where cost qingque or seele passes nikador in cycles very broken balance
skcmoonlord youre trolling if you think it wont happen lol
nobody cares whether you quit the game or not because of a single update sadly
hoyoshill opinion on a hoyo game while getting sponsored by hoyo is crazy
ciphers credits global passive will break the game guys
brother its a single player game absolutely nobody cares if you can clear moc its all in your head just pull on the character you like and play the game you wanna play its piss easy anyway moc is a timesink and borderline unnecessary to enjoy the game now go have fun as there is no fucking meta in a single player game
if a day comes where the global passives are a must to clear endgame content will be the day i will quit the game for now though lets see where this ride takes us still pulling castorice cause big dragon makes simple man happy
hmm
gachasmack crying in the corner
fob is so tone deaf its behind wild
the unfortunate part is if all en decides to drop the game hoyo would literally not care we only make up like of the actual player base for hsr and while there is some complaints over in the cn and jp side they arent as prevalent for the company to make changes thats the harsh reality of the situation some people cant seem to accept games not gonna die or change anytime soon its gonna stay being garbage for years to come and it really sucks to see
topaz global passive acheron global passive oh wow another global passive in a single player game must be the end of the world f all the haters
i quite like the global passive as i find it convenient to get a skilluntility once by pulling one character and share it with every character instead of pulling one character for each team to have the synergy also save me the trouble of leveling up characters it is not as if castorices global passive enables immortality of characters during battle they still can die even mydei is not immortal anyway i pull for characters that i like regardless of meta
complain about the global passive breaking the game realize that the global passive will not break the game complain that other future characters receiving a global passive might break the game realize that other future characters are not getting global passive literally workshopping complaining that other games might introduce global passives that might break their game idea gets shut down immediately guys comon what should we complain about next
if they do add other global passives at least make them as minimal a as possible like a global dmg buff
i think you can see global passive as something to make your game easier to play in the future and for future i mean like even or they wont keep giving global passive to every new character and this isnt even the first global passive character acherons instant kill is also one like for now some player already dont main her but still use her for exploring and in simulated universe if they give us global passive character periodically like every anniversary i think its ok also the good way of global passive is even if the character got powercreep you can still play easier even you dont got the strongest character in the future thats actually good for fp the only two thing we need to worry about are keep giving global passive character every new update and you must need global passive character to win a game but i believe these two wont happen mihoyo is greedy but not stupid ofc they know if they do that players will be leaving
the crybabies are already crying on reddit lmfao
yall didnt talk about anything it was mainly a yap session with absolutely no point and when the serious things were addressed i put it in quotations because it wasnt even addressed properly just the yeah it sucks anyways it is what it is it was poor jenazad vs hoyo shills and braccs was just tryna be neutral tectone and gachasmack shouldve also been there to atleast balance out the sides also fobs undermining of the whole core problem by saying global passive is whatever this is normal in asia and they will like it who cares about global they barely make up any percentage of the playerbaserevenue is just so pathetic while its true because asia gacha culture is beyond cooked and theyre so far gone accepting horrendous gacha practices the western community is still really big this guy usually has good takes but when it comes to standing on business or on actual serious discussions like these his hoyo shilling shows its full colors and he goes full hoyobot even though he calls out hoyo games on a daily basis on his streams
at this point theres only things you do suck it up and accept that global passives will unfortunately be a thing quit the game since theres no point in complaining because they dont listen
yeah west people always complains about everything i mean its not even real pvp game it is a problem if the game are pvp game but it is not we literally play against programmed enemy a bot
i promise nobody cares
for people thinking that this isnt that big of a deal and the passive isnt even that strong you have to remember that this isnt just about the passive itself and how good it is its also about the precedent this sets that hoyo can just lock huge shit like this behind the gacha and because hoyo is currently the biggest gacha company other smaller games will follow suit which will result in the gacha space a pretty predatory space already becoming more predatory
them quitting is literally peak comedy
and also announcing it as if like people would care if you quit like bro
this is not an airport no need to announce your departure
i want them to quit just play something else man its not that deep
literally no one cares lmao cry harder youve been tamed hands on your knees eating out of a trough at the gacha farms stop bleating and eat your slop
vexusdesu its true that people who say ill quit times should quit but your sentences about it aint being that deep is like genshin players mindset so we shouldnt expect qol or any changes because its just a game right
you cared
you say that and yet you still have an hoyo character as profile
ayushkcvx they didnt say they dnt like hoyo tho also u dnt gotta like hoyo to enjoy kafka
is that the one makes gachasmack quit hsr
aaaldivrfe nah he already quit he quit because you can see how hoyo is going to add even more pay to win elements over and over again instead of fixing issues so he dipped he didnt have fun with the game anymore and called quits personally something i believe gacha players cant do no matter how miserable they are
destinystriumph with that kinda mindset i bet hes gonna quit wuwa as well if dev trying to make some money with boosting their products even he already rant over cantarellas faster swimming gimmick in the game
destinystriumph oldgesmack hasnt played hsr seriously for over half a year he was just looking for a loud reason to leave and catch the hype xd
aaaldivrfe no way wuwa is a perfect game and wuwa developers care about players and their opinions they are not like hoyo
viktoraloz ah the illusion of choice
wuwa is far from perfect like any other game its indeed better than its predecessors there is no perfect game every good game has its flaws
viktoraloz holy kurobot
nope you are wrong wuwa is him of gacha games
ohh are you one those zealots
and with that you are finally right for once i applaud you
wow i feel honored
viktoraloz wuwa is constantly improving taking players feedback and implementing it by saying its perfect youre essentially stating that it should make no further improvements loving a game is good but worshipping it is not it will only stagnate the games growth wuwa is appreciated on the basis that it listens to its playerbase why are you calling it perfect because a perfect game simply does not exist as a perfect game would imply it needs no improvements
as you should
but doesnt the developers lining up for any request from players elevate the games status to perfect i think thats true i hope that my request to add an even more naked character with an even larger chest size will also be satisfied because the developers really listen to the players and it would also be great if they removed the limit on flights i also asked them to add the ability to collect chests in aoe so i dont have to look for them its too boring on the other hand they could remove chests from the game altogether its a relic of the past from genshin and send all the currency and resources to the mail at the beginning of the patch this would make the game not just perfect but ideal
viktoraloz what i i think our thoughts are running at different wavelengths uh good day to you
lmaoo the sarcasm went over your head kinda pointless to makes arguements with fanatical zealots who think the game is perfect as it is
yeah especially for fp players with million credits like me
siri i mean isnt that why everyone loves wuwa so much because the developers respect the players slather them with freebies and handouts simplify the movement around the world so its easier to get currency for pulls twist every storyline around a female character who in the end becomes the players new wife i just think they can go even further
idontspeakjapanese i knew he was being sarcastic thats why i was shocked he thought thats what i meant when i was said that wuwas devs listens to their playerbase youre right though i just dont get the point of worshipping a game no matter how good it is
idontspeakjapanese bro icant
just like genshin and hsr wuwa also a dedicted fanatical group of white knights and zealots defending the game for criticisms i wont argue that its the best gacha game it deserves to be it because you can see the devs passion about the game but calling it perfect is literally something else and his reply on your commentbro is on his high horse
idontspeakjapanese yeah i also agree wuwa is really really good game i was completely addicted the first one month i played it and still play consistently every day but to say its perfect and needs no improvements is a really dangerous thought
idontspeakjapanese wuwa fans seem to be too young to engage in an internet conversations
idontspeakjapanese wuwatards are like genshintards theyre like a cult the game has so many faults and this kid is dickriding echo farming and upgrading problem still boring story the most horrible gender ratio
i also like how wuwa listen to their player but one thing i hated in this game which is real money currency is more expensive if you player from europe its ok immagine other people form asia which thier money currency is low than europe currency you need to pay more for itviktoraloz
viktoraloz cut to everybody in the official server still having problems with the optimizations of the game
oh yeah i have them too wuwa almost burned my pc
viktoraloz so not a perfect game then
thatsaber nope still perfect devs listened hail solon
perfect is a stretch its a good game but theres glaring flaws the devs do listen more but the key difference between the companies is that you can tell wuwa devs actually care about their games imo
destinystriumph yes they care about audience without which the game will die unlike hoyo who think only about the money that players bring
viktoraloz yeah but both business models are profitable and wuwas devs only stand out because how bad hoyos are that being said wuwas not perfect just because the devs are good its a id accept someone giving it an its good great even not perfect
destinystriumph i wouldnt say wuwa stands out because of hoyo but because it was a terrible incredibly disastrous launch that greatly affected the start of the game which made the developers beg the players to stay listening to their every wish zz is doing something similar now
viktoraloz im sorry but no gacha game can be a perfect game gacha games by design are predatory and cant ever be perfect
ktqkip so explain how wuwa is perfect then
aaaldivrfe bro those dogsmack already quit long time ago cause he is a wuwa loyal dog
aaaldivrfe i love how youre saying that make some money like hoyoverse isnt already drowning in it and yeah if wuwa follows suit then they deserve the same kind of criticism star rail and genshin is getting right now
viktoraloz clueless wuwa devs care about money and know that they cant fuck up after the disastrously x
zakariamimouni please dont open your mouth if you dont know anything about the companys history and growth over the years but its not like i expect much from people like you tbh lol
guys this viktorai dude is just being sarcastic bruh he literally makes fun of those typical die hard fans that thought their beloved game is the best and yes wuwa also has these types of fans at this point every single product always have their dedicated selfless fanatical maniacs i mean a band as niche as tool can also have that no need to be deep in thought and act like a product is bad because it has die hard fanatics with childish mentality
ive learned today just how many people cant pick up internet sarcasm these days
just ccs and addicts they want everything to stay as
as a fp i cant just ignore it like it gives free pulls why the f i will ignore the endgame
but what exactly is to play besides moc after you are sone with story quests wtf you be on bro theres nothing to play in this game other than moc once you are done with story quest which isnt even enjoyable as its all black screen and white texts
why_areyou do yourself a favour and stop playing this game its designed to suck your money and make you care about things that mean nothing you loose nothing from missing out on pull every days its a trap that eventually becomes a massive time sink i am light spender and i just play this game for the story and i can even clear moc from time to time but its not my end all or be all
ayushkcvx unnecessary being the keyword i never said dont do moc its just not the be all or end all of this game
why_areyou play dusu or grind achievements or even play another game this cant be your only game i mean you dont have to play hsr all the time bro this game is just a side casual game which we play often only during early patch update also its not easy to add tons of quality contents within days every update i choose hsr cause i dont want to grind all day just wanna grind first week then just chilling doing dailiesweekly and irl
this is always the dumbest type of comment
youre just clueless
cultureaddct no dumbest comment here was you
frappuchieno nope
as long as the chinese community doesnt make a move hoyo wont make changes since its pretty obvious theyre the target market just like sweetily said most chinese arent bothered by the global buffs compared to global
galahadxhyour first comparison is not correct hp vs a percentage also it fits her lore and gameplay wise they could easily add more revives on other units would you still say the same thing
galahadxh many units have a revive and in most content that revive is useless end game anyways since you need heals or a shielder and if youre dying then you may as well reset anyways im sure some runs might get saved or have less resets to clear but it doesnt matter for most playres actually doing end game and story content is generally easy enough that you dont need that either the issue is the later implementations of global passives
the issue is that this opens the door for future global passives because people like you are saying this one is fine
noggintoggin i never said its fine though all im saying is if these are required to clear content then the game is truly far too gone
noggintoggin creating more powerful global passives is going to shoot them in the foot twice they not only lose income they will also struggle to control the powercreep here so no the idea or using global passives will destroy them in the long run here for now lets wait for if we dont get any global passives we can guranteed say only anniversary waifus get them only
galahadxhnobody would go to eidolons just for revives revives are pointless in moc you lose the stars if someone dies anyway so not dying is kind of a thing you might want to do castorice passive will never proc for me i will never see it happen ever
galahadxh still that is a super niche case nearly nobody will think oh of going to go for e just for the revive and while i understand you still get max stars the goal is still to not have characters dying and if your a competent player you shouldnt have anyone dying ever unless you are using your healers wronf
galahadxh no because a competent player would still not die in the first place and most likely if your in the situation where your usingnyour healers incorrectly tour not just going to die once your going to have multiple deaths throughout the fight and the passive can only proc once its still a completely useless passive
i mean i can comfortably clear endgame with my es seele whos not seen relic farming in and a half years seele b sparkle fx not even speed tuned cycles moc hp inflation does exist but i only used single busted unit which has limited synergy with the dps and its easily a passing grade in other words yes global passive bad design but as with powercreep and hp inflation the problem is blown vastly out of proportions personally ill have to see how much better hyacine is than ghallager once the dreams of start rolling in thatll determine if i skip cas or not cuz i aint pulling that shit
firesnake not gonna lie shell probably be synergistic with casto and have some way of healing like bailou does
no you wont you will keep moving the goalposts because of sunk cost fallacy people said the same thing when resistances meant something
kashmz nah once its like that its ggs for me besides i treat hsr more like a side game like clash of clans anyways i aint afraid to let it go
salientspeaker deep test kit is already out no global passive
thats the thing itll never happen lmao
hes smacking again
he is going back to monster hunter worlds
this revelation is not new trust me
orthrus just wanted to say it to all the babies
well he is also tired as all heal streaming for hours and then getting in a call after
not to mention many of those chinese gamers are millionaires they could literally fund hsr non stop
we have no idea about the financial side of things and no data to confirm that as for players i doubt million or so are cn players only theres japan korea europe and the us and theres like billion plus people in total and over million players
yulfine you think this game has million active players in lmaoo
iamadrian_ currently active monthly amount is around million players globally theres around million players doesnt mean theyre always playing genshin has like x that or more despite its issues so yeah
yulfine proof
iamadrian_ you can google the info for yourself however we cant know how many in china for example play unless the devs give official numbers sites that estimate guess the last days suggest around million active players up from januarys million you have to factor all platforms which makes it harder from pc to cn console etc
yulfine i i think billions is too much its like youre saying of human population are playing hoyo games
shinra no im saying the population is roughly that between those areas theres million or so total players unless i mistyped which is possible theres roughly million players active monthly
thats the thing westerners make everything about them some random small cc tried to sic the cnjp community on hoyoverse to get them to change things like what
future update characters got a new global passive that deletes en complainer
meta has absolutely nothing to do with this issue and i dont understand why people always need to justify i pull for i like while missing the point that theyre just bad in general
amari you havent even seen it develop lets just go back to the power level of and stay like that either you havent played any other gachas or everything to remain stale
deviantl ive played many other gacha games and i can tell you that hsr power creep is such a problem because the game at its core is terrible even by turn based gacha standards this is coming from someone whos played since beta when power creep happens in other games its because of interactive mechanics between enemy and player for example fgo with its countless racism buff on top of them buffing older characters limbus company constantly gives new units that fill out archetypes for some examples again all the points people try to make about other gacha dont apply to as many as people want to believe and even then the ones that do qualify are some mostly obscure titles average gacha players wont know about so what are u trying to prove
you are right since meta has nothing to do with this issue why are people making a fuss you said it is bad please elaborate
its primarily because pushing global passives in the form of characters instead of how other gachas do it which is just a free grindable system basically just says to hoyo that they can make characters as non fp as they want whether its make more stars with these effects scaling content with the intent of needing to roll these units which mobs or not or potentially moving these ideas to their other games
i always feel that whether to roll for a limited star characterweapon is up to the player hyv is not forcing anyone to pull anything there is no mustpull characterweapon as a fp from the day of release of hsr other than onwards i have all the supports except jiaoqiu and substains except huohuo my teams do not need the revival global passive of castorice but im still pulling for her because i like her design global passives are beneficial to my teams as that means i do not need to level up characters to use the passives imagine buffs energy regen shields heals are in character passives maybe then i just need to bring dpsers and dont need to pull so many characters a bit farfetched but even if it happens we are probably at the end of hsr journey
at that point why not just actually do wat other games do and just make a free system that does the exact same thing the issue is the fact that theyd rather go the scummiest way possible just sell more characters rather than make interesting systems that have proven to work to make the game more interesting you could easily do way more with standalone systems but instead they chose the worst way possible cuz they know no one is going to complain
ive already pointed out why i feel it is beneficial to me why must every game copy one another if anyone is not happy with a game just quit and play other games
andrinaleong its almost like having a good system is just good to have in any game again the point im getting at is why not just make it a whole system that accomplishes the same goal instead of just making characters each with a passive like this
i wouldnt like it as it gives me the feeling of repetition or copying of other games for example i started openworld game with genshin and when i tried wuthering waves i had a hard time going through x because the feeling of playing genshin again comes in even looking at the wuwa interface menus gives me that feeling and it is quite unbearable i believe if i had started with wuwa or other openworld games first it would give me the same unenjoyable experience i do not like to play games that have thingssystems that are too similiar
because other games already have it i already said i would not like this to be implemented as i dont like games to copy one another also when people complain in the feedback i hope that they do suggest an alternative solution to the problem talking is easy solving problem is not anyway there is no point discussing this topic any further as everyone has hisher own opinion ill stick to mine
i love how you want an alternative solution when i literally just told you wat the alternative solution is but youre too busy focusing on the idea of them copying it from other games
most real shit anyone has said ly bro
i dont get it why are you talking like you know what hoyo is going to do what makes you confident in saying that if they did it once why wouldnt they do it again
do you seriously think this is a one time thing this game has shown time and time again they will powercreep everything and powercreep it aggressively in order to maximise profit they will monetise this further hell they even monetised the anniversary rewards you cannot be so blind to not have foresight theyve shown you their business model and yet you want to pretend they wont follow it out of the kindness of their hearts
how do you know they wont add more global passives to characters as they releases them
fran fr tho we for sure getting more global passives and i bet they will stack with each other too
hahahahaha
saying they will not make more global passives is like saying that after acheron nobody had a gamechanging e ever yeah right they tested the idea of an early busted e with acheron and went and gave everyone and their mama an insane e cast is a global passive test and there is zero reason to not give the later characters even more insane passives but its a nice cope to think hoyo are so nice to make this a one off thing
we are getting a global passive by the end of this year
i hear some of the fate characters might have global passives as well
the global passive already has its own ui so i guess they gonna release more in the future and im sure its some broken passives that will adjust the endgame
harzinlolz no you dont because theres no information about their kits
tempestu i mean yes it would have its own ui because its a basic ui and animation but thats for castorice specifically dataminers have not provided any information of any further units having one but yes its possibly others probably the next anniversary will
yulfine how do you know what i know
yulfine also how do you know they wont add global passives to other characters if one character has one then others probably will as well
what about they step up the scale if hoyo plan to introduce this sharing global passive to friend you choose global active skill like blessing skill yin du
thats gonna be a problem if you have multiple global passive characters
almnd_tfuo this is absurd e dhil already was the first heavy eidolon investment dps and it literally passed entire version for another character to have a game changer e from my point of view global passive are going reserved for heavy lore characters like maybe for more characters on the enterity of x like phainon and probably fate collab right know from limited only ff acheron feixiao and maaybe dhil have game changing e the rest are not even close in terms of value so everyone and their mama is basically instigating for fun lmao
people are saying that this incentivizes greedier practices its not about what the global passive its about the implication of what hoyo knows what they can get away with when they release characters the goalpost always gets moved it may seem like a nothing burger now but eventually powercreep will start affecting global passives as well and itll be to the point where not having a unit will place your account behind
tacticaldimples that is what am saying
this is literally just wrong other units are getting the global passive lmao theres already like other global passives leaked lmao
fran quit the game then lmfao
i did though i dont see how that has anything to do with what i said
""
chat clip this be back in year when we have multiple characters with global passives
fran what makes you confident that you know what youre talking about and what hoyoverse is going to do do you work there do you see the future or just play their games like the rest of us
jisforjae i have never stated that though i just said that if they did it once why wouldnt they do it again and well more global passives have been leaked already including one fate character maybe true maybe not but most of the time leaks have been correct
this didnt age well lol and how the freak is a free revive on all characters from the account not game breaking lol i love the game but we have to be honest just having castorice in my account would forever change the way i play the game for the only reason that playing with buffer wasnt viable since one of my characters would probably die before the end of the fight but now is easy for me but what about the guy that would miss
damn you have too much hope when powercreep exist
the entire issue is literally the precedent it sets do you actually think theyll never add another global passive that isnt better people like you are exactly what hoyo wants absolutely critical thinking and just writing off everything as pointless complaining
mm ok i sewhat effective bait
dude that is way too overpowered
it will be funny if its like credits on simulated universe that will be hilarous and a slap in the face for the complainers
haha
i want to disclose that the global buff will most likely be balanced out i mean imagine if characters has a global buff your account will most likely be allowed to only choose one to use at a time so it really isnt that bad in this regard
firasj so what if global passives stack as characters are released tho
firasj and if they do let you use all the global passive i think its still ok as i said if global passive isnt the main reason for you to win the game then thats fine fp can win normally and pw will get a es anyway
firasj based on what people said most likely it will get reverted before v of the beta and look how that turned out do you seriously think they will deactivate peoples abilities they paid for ofcourse not they want as much money as possible so theyre going to release more of these characters to pull and if they allow them to stack it gives you less reason to skip if you like youre existing passive
not sure if acherons tech counts as a global passive if it only works with her on the team let alone input to activate it a passive doesnt require input acherons technique at least requires her to be on the team castorice revive does not she just needs to exist on the account period its not entirely the end of the world about it at least to me but i understand why it can be seen as a dark precedent for the future units that come with passives that work outside the team
avertburden my bad i should be clear what i wanna said is a similar situation with acheron and castorice for acheron shes for exploring map and play simulated universe easier but you can play without her for castorice shes use for avoiding your team accidentally died and need to restart the game but if you do build your sustain well you can also play without her for people who said castorice global passive destroying hsr are stupid what really matter is they keep giving out tons of character with global passive or make global passive too op will mihoyo know these too and change idk lets see
the reasons i think they will only allow one active at a time is simply because stacking these buffs will literally break the game if i thought of adding this then i will simply give it to a new character and to the trailblazer and allow one at a time i dont know though how they will work with the buff but they wont allow them to stack since this will break the game
for one you have no idea if they wont give global passives to every unit two acheron does not have a global passive
firasj no that would defeat the whole purpose of them
cultureaddct since you seem to be an expert are you know hoe many global passives will release in the future because as things stand castorice is the only confirmed case whats to say that we wont have another one untill version global passive doomshilling is always if and when also functionally acherons technique gives you a global advantage you can utilize its effects of insta killing mobs but just slotting her in and then swapping off an advantage which doesnt exist if you dont own her
yesno can you use acheron ability in mocpfapo i say castorice global passive same as ruan mei passive but the different is she only work in su if castorice passive didnt work in the end game content trust me no one would complain she gives advantage even its little its still is and she only need to exist on the account
peak comedy
we knew a month plus ago about it to be honest anyone who paid attnetions to leaks but no dataminers have suggest anything else there are fake leaks for phainon or hyacine apparently claiming they have global buffs or something
nah agree w the rest but if tectone was in there id rather shoot myself then listen to him complain about nothing for hours
bro commented pure facts
to be fair brax was also playing wizardry daphne so bro probably wasnt caring too much about the conversation also i think hes at a point and most of them are at a point where no one really cares
you already said asia gacha mentality is cooked so why are western players try to change it and if they add tectone and gacha smack the end result will be they will just agree on tectone and gacha smack without giving their own opinions on the matter because lets be honest when talking to tectone or gacha smack any slightly positive opinion u have on this will be downplay immediately
its one of things everyone will agree for the sake of them just being brick walls or gacha smack and the gang are just going to say the most obvious stuff and act like its the most profound seeds of wisdom
asia players are beyond cooked accepting horrendous gacha practices because first things first why would you even play a gacha game if you hate being cooked you westerners are the only yappers like you have so many say in a certain thing the skin color the nationality of a certain character the skills the passive and so many more us most asia players are so chill while you guys are being pathetic ungrateful westerner tourists are always free to leave board the plane and adios
what can i say man i speak nothing but the truth that everybody is too afraid to say this guy is the biggest hypocrite in all of hoyo ccs and is a worse case than enviosity his community is so obnoxiously hoyopilled that they make enviositys community look pale in comparision the toxic positivity and heavy undermining of the problems in hsr has gotten so out of hand and its thanks to this guy and his fanbase truly a shame to see hsr go down a route way worse than genshin ever did mainly thanks to the devs but communitywise thanks to this guy
jokerofcards imagine calling someone hypocrite because he likes and genuinely enjoy the game bro is this the influence of dumb ccs youve been watching first calling asia gacha mentality cooked and now calling mrpokke and his communities hypocrite holy
yes he is a hypocrite and its very obvious to anyone with a brain his twitter posts are back and forth of i dont war just peace into the most instigative ragebait or straight up shit takes over and over again he also said he would not roll on castorice if the global passive actually goes to live but im sure hes getting es when his cult of a community funds his pulls and he claims that his community forced him to es her like he did with other super hyped units also hes sure as heck doing his hardest to defend hsr following the stream on his twitter by either memeing on global passives undermining the core problem or calling out the ccs that spoke against it if you still think im calling this guy a hypocrite because he genuinely enjoys a game then we can end the conversation right here asia gacha mentality is cooked legit dont see whats wrong with what i said there the amount of predatory gacha practices they willingly accept because of their horrendous addiction to gacha games pvp and wanting to always be competitive is why theyre beyond cooked i mean theres a reason they wont give a single damn about castorice global passive heck im sure theyre celebrating it because they love predatory trash like this i already explained why mr jokke is a hypocrite as for his community theyre straight up a significantly more obnoxious hoyoinfested chat than enviositys community ever was which is just beyond insane to give you one example out of the numerous ones just look at the whole castorice global passive situation and how theyre treating it they constantly meme on it to undermine it constantly shit on all the other ccs that actually try to speak up actively call out how horrible of a change it is and the precedence it sets for the game for example look at gachasmacks video and the perception it had from mrjokkes pathetic community when of smacks vid was straight up calling things how they are you legit outed yourself as one of that obnoxious horde by calling them dumb ccs lmao and constantly attack anyone that dares to criticize their holy perfect game they arent just obnoxious massive whiteknights they are also pretty damn aggressive about it honestly it is disgusting to look at
jokerofcards its wild how hsr had so much good faith with the community only to burn it all in a year
i mean thats the hoyo cycle isnt it first it was genshin then it went to hsr with them baiting us by making us think theyre different from genshin only for it to be signiciantly worse i guarantee you zz will be next in a year or two given how based we think zz devs are only for the cycle to repeat itself people have to start waking up and realize hoyo is the scummiest of the scummiest game companies in the world and to never ever place trust in anything they do
jokerofcards first of all when did he said his not going to pull for castorice when the global buff is release too show me proof then i believe you plus its pretty obvious he did because it was for content like bro what second if u watch his recent livestream he talks about the if ccs were to pulled for castorice it will affect how viewers sees them if they pull they will be called hypocrite and if they did not then they will be praised but also on other hand the people that genuinely like castorice or likes the game will they also be called hypocrite dumb or hoyoshills lastly its pretty obvious the ccs that u watch their influence will also affects you u know there is a saying that goes the ccs reflects their communities gacha smack and tectone though they have pretty good mindset on all this but they consider people or players that enjoy the game dumb and hypocrite just like whats happening right now so tell me why are the people who really likes game gets affected by this
pretty much this since global passive was confirmed to be in the game hsr is cooked and they just cannot remove it at all anymore this livestream serves as a soft filter to some players if you cant accept the current state of hsr then quit right now otherwise shut up accept the fact this is how this game will unfortunately be and keep playing
yep thats it hoyo dont give a f uninstall
unfortunately ppl wont do either of these two theyll keep complaining or hating the game and still playing it
please quit and uninstall youre doing hsr playerbase a huge favor
raidenyato if you care so much about the game that you would uninstall it because of a change in the pvp system they why the hell even play pvp was never the great part about the game
ill suck it up if they implement global passive to every single character that exists in the game yes every single one star and standard star included
or just enjoy the game
raidenyato just uninstall it and shut up
if youre not from the major spenders which is china then stop the yap they dont gaf you westerners are the only weird thing in every gacha games
bendefreudethe game dosent have pvp
they listened on buffing old characters they listened on adjusting the storytelling its very clear that the players voices matter on this in a way that they do not with genshin impact because genshin has a huge swath of players that love the game as is hsr doesnt have that wuwa doesnt have that zz doesnt have that they do have to listen because the people complaining are a much larger portion of the playerbase castorices global passive if they stop making new global passives in the future would not kill the game
eckology well thats the thing the fate collab characters and phainon were already leaked to have global passives and those are not something useless like castos revive
nono you have it all wrong they didnt listen to buffing old characters they just want to give you the illusion that they did it was addressed from and that wed atleast get some major news by only for them to mention it in a single sentence and to postpone it to this is pathetic extremely pathetic adjusting the storytelling still isnt officially in the game and theyve taught me to never take whatever they say for granted thanks to their empty promises or straight up blatant lies so i wont believe it until i experience the improvements myself in the future patches and we really should stop with the cope around castorices global passive istg this mrdookie guys community is so hoyopilled they make up the most delusional takes revolving this passive they will make more global passives they will be way stronger and beneficial and they will stack its a horrible precedence i know it you know it everybody knows it but unfortunately many hoyowhiteknights are turning a blind eye then once things turn out exactly the way many people with above room temp iq said it would it would have been way too late hsr devs do not give a single damn about what the players think they never did they want to make people think that they care but really they dont
itzmekinto you an complain while still playing im sure at your workplace you have complaints but instead of leaving you still stay
i feel that i really do not care about global passive and i am not going to pull for cas
redlove why would i stay if i dont like the environment of my workplace or complain about how my boss is bitch then i quit isnt that normal thing to do
truth lol its clear hoyo wont bother at all with criticism or survey theres no need to keep playing if you hate it and for those who do well good for them too
lmao kinda sad that you cant have the third option for this company even if you like the game and want it to get better its either stay in the rot or full abandonment and never the option to make them change stagnation path is actually true and real
that doesnt matter and if it needs to be pvp to justify being made then thats just downright stupid
even outside of gacha games westerners really love to complain
yep first moc too easy then too hard thi character too strong then too weak like end game is the only content when even missing stars on each one gives you pulls
yep en hoyo community just sucks jp and cn are so much better
some other gachas already have this theres no cause other gachas to do anything
yes thats the main concern however so far dataminers have not provided anything suggesting any other units at least in x to have any sort of global passive plus while many are rather indifferent to it cn isnt afraid to jump ship and attack the company and a lot of their players are free to play as well if not a larger portion or theyre light spenders who spend here and there most are not whales thats always a minority
global buffs been in mobile games for plus years thinking game will be designed around global buffs is intellectually dishonest when the game isnt designed around es
the sooner people realize this only effect endgame and of the rest of the game will be fine everybody should know gacha endgame is the only place they can realistically make pw since few people care about it to begin with and its not locking story or events from you you can still clear content as fp in endgame without castorice a lot of people were saying you needed ruan mei or robin to clear back in the day but they got proven wrong too when they were about the closest thing to an account buff you could get since between both of them every single kind of team trivialized the game back than
maybe try contributing to the conversation instead of just leeching views from other creators
holy yap vods
mr yapper waited minutes for his yapping to begin
jenazad was pretty much right the casual fanbase which is like of the hsr playerbase gives zero fucks about the implications of the global passive the only ones itll deeply hurt in the long run are those who are way too kneedeep into gacha as a culture and this is like the mega minority in the modern gacha space as a whole nowadays you can bitch and doom but for so as long as the st paragraph of what jenazad said exists nobody will care to change anything
literally yap session
there is more this version cant wait to see the reaction to them
for now theres nothing we can dojust gonna accept the global passive thingthey wont hear our opinions or take the qol from the playerunless from the og country itselfim worried about the future of this gamebut stillet pray and hope its going wellhsr still one of my favourite gameand still going too play no matter whatjust gonna enjoy the game ignore those things like its doesnt even exist
idk if this was mentioned or not but we didnt really see how would multiple global works work right i mean why do people assume that they will stack in the first place i actually think that there will be just limit of working global passive and thats it it would be funny cus then all this drama is really for nothing i dont think there will be working global passives or smth
word of the day chat
holy wow
thats exactly the point endgane is a side hustke non required to progress hsr as a fp experience you only pay if you want for extras and thats it listening to whining on ruining the experience is just bullcrap
this is just stupid mindest cause the problem isnt the castorice global passive effect the problem is that this now lets the flood gates open to global passives in general i wouldnt put it past them if they decide to make some account passive like ur team bow ignores defense or action advances all allies at start of battle
accountthatexists yes you wouldnt put it past them but are those mechanics in the game now if you speculate about the future you can imagine literally anything like a character who automatically generate stellar jades in your account daily or ensure your relics roll into whatever stat you want once per week most people arguments are bonkers gamebreaking mechanics hsr devs are literally scared of dance dance dance lightcone and eagle set they wont even powercreep them because they already break the game as is and probably would not have been made right now had they known its effects on the game
thats not the point the point is theres going to be more global passive which is more op than reviving which is attack or speed or defense hp etc thats the problem its not just castorice its about the future of the game the upcoming more global passive
accountthatexists those extreme example are the same as if i step outside my house a plane will crash right on top of me
accountthatexistsbro acts like they are gonna bring back acheron insta kill in moc back
kennethyoung i dont think youre getting the actual point yes the examples he gave were exaggerated but the point is that before that wasnt even a possibility because global passives were not a thing now since they are a thing it has become a possibility that something along those lines would exist i doubt something as broken as that but maybe idk and thats good for absolutely no one really besides hoyo becasue they maybe make more money because of it idk
kennethyoung the fact they are scared about that as you say is because everyone can have access to them without paying them you cant really compare a star lc and a farmable set vs limited characters gallagher himself had probably been one of their most failed creations for the sole fact he is way too good they are not on our side
fran i mean if they just wanted money they could sell skins thats way easier money from all types of players instead of only making a mechanics that meta focused player would care about
melowmelow gallagher is quite balanced he was made with supporting the new meta in mind of attack frequency break and debuffs without gallagher many people wouldnt have a good fp option for characters like acheron firefly or feixiao which were the main dps units of x they also made remembrance mc for free and they are more cracked than they make fp character really good now because thats the power level they need to be worth using
you dont need it for end game either in fact its mostly useless there you have unlimited tries in runs and if youre dying in your end game runs youre already doing something wrong anyways so it doesnt matter thats not the issue the issue is global passives that start providing damage buffs or something or if they add pvp which i also dont see happening to be honest
thats true ive survived whole x versions without robin aventurine huo huo was able to clear all endgame and now in x im still doing okay without therta and aglea in fact i didnt pulled any x character yet
so do you think people would be complaining if they were making skins i believe every single person would prefer that alternative gallagher is by far the best star in the game in my opinion they also made match th wich also is a godsend for fp players and even competes with topaz on feixiao comps and the mc is really cracked with his only downside being you can only have type of mc at a time wich is fair but i really cannot find any justifiable measure to implement a game mechanic that applies in combat without said character that has the mechanics even being in your daam active team if we would use the lore acurate reason they used in the stream we could use the same argument for every single other character that has a major role numby can be in any team cuz topaz lends him to you fu xuan can negate team wide attack cuz she predicated it before the fight started and all the other bullshit reasons they can come up with if every single character is limited to active team slots why in gods green earth should any other character not be
bro is sungjinwoo
he was busy aura farming
tbf he probably wanted to make a more informed take so he doesnt go down the greedy and stupid route
arise sniffa
man expanded his domain of yap
im so glad this update is filtering out all of the annoying people like nobody cares that youre quitting theyll probably be back in months from now because they want to satisfy their gambling addiction
whats funny to me is that theyre announcing that theyre quitting as if like people would care to begin with theyre literally the mourning actors
idontspeakjapanese they need validation that what they are doing is right insecure people
what are you smoking lmao
i think its right and wrong at the same time yes of the player base are casuals inside it there is mega casuals up to almost non casual gamers they dont give a shit thats for sure then you have the try harders or non casual gamers who cares a lot and inside it the ones who can make a difference are the whales but they wont and the rest has literally no impact
were not smoking anything were talking in laymans terms cultureaddct
mubta game isnt going to die but it will get worse and worse over time genshin is an example of this better yet hi is an even better example because hsr feels like its doing what hi was doing in the past yeah it may not matter a much now but overtime youll start to really feel it always needing to pull for new characters their gear to keep up its not a good thing if you plan to play the game long term and youll start to realize that the game favors newcomers over veterans
yea like why care anyway this is singleplayer game play whenever you like
mubta youre glad that people calling out a company for evil practices are gone so that they can implement more without scrutiny sure the gacha industry is inherently predatory doesnt mean it needs to become more predatory
naah casuals arent the ones spending money though maybe the majority of the casuals dont care but people who invest into their account like mrpokkes peeps are def gonna make an impact
i hate this opinion because it shames you for caring someone doesnt have to be a gambling addict to love star rail and have a line in the sand they feel is important and worth speaking up over yeah a lot of people dont care abd thats reality but its literally no reason to patronize anyone who wants to speak up hoping others and hoyo will care its not just people with ego and addiction
lukebruton its a gacha game if you get emotional and angry over the unimportant things in life like a game company adding something unfair to a single player game that already uses dirty practices you need to reevaluate your life
mubta how dare a person be a upset over a game he likes to play you should be like mubta whos a monk that is just zen on everything in life
lukebruton blud yapping as if he had to pay to play this game facebluesmiling
enjoy your game in the future when all that is left are casual fps that dont spend a dime in the game have fun with hoyo being moe lazy than they are now in the near future lmao
haerin why would the people who spend money quit playing this game whales wont care if castorice has a global passive because they can just get es of whatever character and clear everything that way the people who are complaining are mostly western players in the vocal minority and im sure they havent spent a dime compared to the asian players who make up of hoyos revenue
haerin also genshin is still one of the highest earning gacha games and it caters to casual players yet the whales are still spending
mubta so this update is filtering out the people that actually want to put the game to a standard and want a good game
adogewithwifi the game will be fine and the world will keep spinning its no big deal the casual players that play for an hour or two a day wont care because they dont grind and maximize everything the players who spend money frequently wont care care because they can just get castorice or get eidolons for any character they want and clear the content that way whats this passive really going to do in a single player game like oh boy you cleared moc one cycle faster because your dps tanked a powerful blow and now you get extra turn and even then someone without castorice can just click two buttons to restart the run
wow what a surprise the apple of gacha games arent suddenly going bankrupt well yeah theyre still going to be one of the highest earning its not like they suddenly lose all the revenue they have that they can put towards the game talk about the decline compared to previous patches if we are talking about a company like hoyo you just proved my point you need other people who play the game other than story gooning like yourselves because u know damn well its not going to survive the same way its been doing
lukebruton filtering annoying people but its not in skill or intellect in gambling addiction brainrot lmao
haerin brother genshin is still alive and bigger than wuwa even though wuwa is objectively the better game the casuals dont give a fuck its the sad truth
like i said its not going to die its hoyo theyre a billion dollar company with the army of shills they sure will not like it when their revenue goes downhill which it already has since natlan
haerin in fact the casuals are those that can spend on the game as most of them or like me got jobs and which we can afford to spend also sadly to say those that has big complains are usually the fp casuals that brings no income to the company
randomboi in fact casuals are working adults which they can afford to spend or even whale if their income is high those fp casuals are just part of the big casual group
randomboi casuals aret the ones that spends money the most there are literally hundreds and even thousands of players out there that are working adults that can just dump their salaries on to the game
mubta you are probably the guy who justifies spending money for a pixel on a screen over a marriage ceremony sad youre a lost cause condolences to you
zekeaffy what does that have to do with anything if you have nothing of value to say then dont bother me
mubta its not just the fact that people want things to be better honkai star rail started off as the gacha game that was better and a step forward and its disappointing to see the game take a step back almost every other patch hoyo filtering people is not even healthy for the game its really not far from having a reputation that will steer people away from wanting to get into it
jackiecianura who decided that the game is going backwards maybe you as a hsr player i dont think the game is getting worse personally it provides the same experience as a year ago as before why did you decide that your opinion is the only correct one
adogewithwifi that standard is not up to the players to hold what the fuck did you do to earn that right
tdof how will this steer new players from getting into hsr i think if a new player were to start playing during and they pulled castorice with their beginner rewards it would help them in the long run and make combat more comfy im tired of seeing people commenting about how theyre going to quit and how hsr is going to die we all know that at least of them are lying and only doing it for attention because they either quit playing hsr awhile ago or never even played or tried the game in the first place and just want to see the game burn or theyre not actually quitting and are just mad because they arent castorice fans and they have to watch the castorice enjoyers get extra benefits
viktoraloz stupid people with stupid opinions v im not sure if people who always complain are actually playing the game or not
tacticaldimples one of the many reasons why hsr will never be like hi is because hsr doesnt have a pvpscoringleaderboard system if you remove the need to score very high just to retain your rankings or compete with the leaderboard in hi there will be little to no need to pull very often for the new units in hsr stars already means nirvana in hi since you get the maximum possible reward and thats with a cycle allowance not clearing floor means you just lose on jades which is similar to just being in rl or agony and thats fine almost everyone is fine with that
randomboi you havent seen chinese players brolink at least spend on the game as casuals
and not to mention they are the main target market of hoyo and where they get most of their money
mubta man there are many games much better than hsr for those gambling addicts in the end you think this game is the top game when its only top in the revenue well its steadily declining and that only shows how predatory this game is
mubta lmaoo real
megumin when did i ever say anything about hsr being the best game i can recognize this game has flaws and its far from perfect hp inflation story bloat lack of animation etc this community has become a cesspool for negativity and all im doing is calling out stupidity because the doom posting is everywhere now this is the third time someone in this comment section has misconstrued my comments and its almost a difficulty dealing with this side of the community im going to go out on a limb and say this specific global passive wont make much of a difference in gameplay and people will forget about it in weeks you can hold me on that because im sure once people see how it doesnt make a huge difference in gameplay theyll quietly delete and take back their comments on how you need global passive or your account is cooked
mubta first of all you are assuming they are coming back like its the only game they can play people play games for enjoyment and for others especially on games like gacha their longevity this game is mid at best and i am glad i quit this game by maybe not spending anything coz i already learned my lesson in genshin also helped the influx of new players are not going up but thinking people will return just because of gacha addiction is just plain stupid there are games much better than this getting released everyday and this game just continues to go more and more predatory ps one global passive wont matter but after the fifth or sixth global passive in the consecutive release mattered as they factor these in when designing endgame would hurt like hell and i am waiting for people who are defending this mechanic get this bit on their ass
megumin i really doubt theyre going to make it where you can have multiple global passives at once and whos to say they wont give older star characters that people already have global passives as well they could include them into silver wolf or kafkas kit and continue that trend with other stars as well when they get their respective buff
i am casual but i think that global passives are a really bad idea
yuki_ika why do you think so
megumin if u really wanna quit this game then stop commenting on this video you still care about this game if u still care to comment on this topic people need to realize this is a gacha game ofc some characters are gonna be op but that doesnt mean you need to pull it what u can critisize is not the character but the endgame content like the enemy with hp inflation ect bc thats why the needs to pull a character is from when you cant clear the endgame content so you should pull a spesific character get ur priorities right
i played gacha games since fgo jp first week release and still dont understand why people are this upset about global passive in a non pvp gacha game if theres pvp fine but hsr the game isnt even that hard lmao
wandererman you think i wanna i hope im wrong with this one and not doomposting but this move by hoyo if become successful will rub off to other gacha games coz you know hoyo is a placeholder of a successful game via revenue and shareholder perspective they are the so called golden standard for every gacha game in existence that wants to earn money special case for kuro since all they did was listen if you think this isnt a gacha space problem then you are in an illusion and deep into addiction thinking hoyoverse is all it is in the gacha space this move is fomo xxl
tacticaldimples the only reason for you to pull new characters in hi is if you want to compete in nirvana outside of that everything still clears with old characters old being characters
sakura no uta pfp
randomboi you must be slow and delusional cause casuals are spending money cause they arent going to sweating to get gems and would rather pay a little to pull they dont go balls deep but they still send i know cause my sister is like this
mubta imagine thinking youre the smart one for simping for a greedy company and not the players who actually want the game to improve mrdookie was right about the greedy and stupid only it applies to himself and his cult
buddy talking about illusion while hes in delusion if u think like that then why no other gacha games following the path of fgo then its the biggest gacha game before genshin and hsr appeared at the end of the day u need to learn what is the core of gacha games especially with no pvp in the game
tacticaldimples global passives on more and more characters newcomers will be shafted pretty hard tho ofc assuming that does happen people like to say its ccs fault the drama exists to begin with to some extent i agree they are negatively exaggerating some things but many complaints are pretty valid its just most hoyo players are heavy casuals and they dont really care about a lot of things as long as they can get and spend for their favorite characters theyre gonna greenlight anything that comes their way
lukebruton u arent wrong but the ones to complain to is the regulators
amirmahdi so disagreeing with people and not doom posting about hsr simping for a greedy company
so now its bad for people who love the game to expect more from a multibillion company hsr and genshi were top of all gacha games now none of them can reach that point they arent even nominee anymore yall literally fighting for the game dev to just not care about you anymore did yall see the d effects on that game like wtf is this with main mc that get a distorted mouth in some scenes why are you against your game getting better
kwhitepearl who do you think hoyo value more a random that pull for some character cause they pretty or the guy that go es on all his meta character to do massive damage
mubta think about a new players that get in hsr after now his account is ruined until castorice rerun and he now has to fight boss that put you to hp and enemies with attack that goes through shield
daone you dont need a revive to clear the content people have been able to do it without a castorice passive until now so whats the difference
like to dislike ratio on the livetstream suggests a rate but yeah the majority still doesnt seem to give a fck
mubta i would agree with you if it werent for the new boss that put you to hp and the enemies with attack that goes through shield
daone you clearly dont know what youre talking about spend minutes looking at the leaked boss gameplay and come back the mechanic encourages you to use healers to quickly restore your health back to normal which is very easy to do if you have gallagher of luocha who btw is free now
mubta it does matter actually as it sets a precedents for other gachas in the future as well as idk peoples money people should be outraged it can certainly ruin people its not a joke its gambling feels bad when you invest money and time on a character then is powercrept in patches
ammarshamsul how will this affect other peoples money its a gacha game no shit everything it does will influence spending you cant gaslight the majority of people into changing their mind and thinking this is a bad idea now and especially the devs because theyve already made their decision and its too late to go back give the game some time for them to release the character buffs before you cry about your investments and builds being wasted you people do nothing but talk about whatifs instead of just and accepting what the game is now or quitting
the majority of people arent outraged like you are this game isnt competitive there is no pvp there is no leaderboard there is no ranked system anyone with money can clear all of the content because thats just how gacha games work they arent going to release a boss or an endgame stage that requires you to have a guaranteed revive no matter the team setup because that would just be horrible design from a gameplay perspective
cultureaddct name me one team comp that needs to revive sustainless maybe but sustainless is built to do enough dmg to not even need a single point of healing much less a revive the point is that a global revive isnt needed because it only procs if you either make bad decisions or youre just not built well no character needs to be revived especially if youre running huo lingsha and aventurine
arby exactly global passives are more like crutches for newlow investment players or for people who just suck at the game its not a necessity its just there to make the game easier
arby the fuck does that have to do with anything lmao
randomboi not exactly they do spend on the game especially since they dont do dailiesevents and they only login when theres new story update and new banner so they need to spend to get the
calithilhel theres also no reason to patronize anyone who have different opinion as hoyoshills the reason why this whole debat is stupid is because everyone cant have civil discussion without calling name on each other
thane yeah it certainly doesnt help how heated people are getting i understand why though people who are against the globals feel like this is a near existential issue and they feel like ccs like pokke dont understand so they dont know what to do besides lash out harder in this community especially pokke has been inconsistent on the issue maintaining both that globals are bad for the game but its just a game so it doesnt matter if you pull for fun he did do a community post today saying he changed his mind today and hell explain tomorrow on stream though i wonder how that will go
idontspeakjapanese true dudes and gals be actually thinking that theyre so important that everyone cares about them quitting a mobile game
yeah myself am just gonna stop playing this game at all gonna spend my money in divinity and play that am quitting gachas
cautious optimism good choice imo
even og country they dont care there are a few but its still not enough watch bilibili livestream
i agree its dumb to just up and quit from this but if thinks keep going like this then i could
redvelvetisbetter not necessarily because lets be honest as a whole hsr really doesnt have much aside from good animation thats keeping it good but the content and gameplay even by gacha standards has always been mediocre theres very little reason to stay if its character devs dont care
amari its story and so forth is actually much better than most gacha games because most focus on mainly pvp content and most have far fewer animations and fidelity etc as well so it really depends
and wat exactly are these most gachas cuz i could easily list gachas that have a better story than hsr by a mild and one or of them also have pvp so wat you said is just out right bs star rail really doesnt have anything that makes it stand out outside of it being a hoyo game hell even amongst hoyo games it still gets clapped by zz and genshin
amari just because you dont like the star rail story and dont think its good doesnt mean it isnt its so embarrassing how your going off about how awful star rail is when all they said was that they liked the story and gameplay better than others
blaze tbh quitting gacha games is the best thing you can do better to spend your money on actual games atp
redvelvetisbetter except star rails story and gameplay arent good anyone whos played other turn based games in general let alone gachas can tell you this my point was wat are these most gachas their reasoning for why star rails story and gameplay are better is simply just wrong because there are gachas like counter side and epic seven that have pvp and still have a better story a gacha having pvp has nothing to do with them not having good gameplay or story the people who always wanna throw other gacha under the bus when it comes to hoyo games never actually know what their talking about because they dont know any games that fit their own criteria
knightoftreachery or just play gachas that arent hoyo games
redvelvetisbetter its crazy how you missed the point i was getting at in why what they said is dumb but like every hoyoshill its always wat they like not what they said to justify their point
amari bro star rails story has better story telling than epic seven or counter side and i have played both i am more locked in with hsr and more theorizing future events with them than es and cs
how the fuck do you expect only one global passive to work
or cas may be the only one with it
because if you follow the leaks then you know that there is a dedicated tab for global passives while in combat
bunnyx nah there will be more probably although all of them would be more or less on the same level as castorices for me personally it just makes sense how do you even imagine having smth stupid like crit rate as global passive lol
its not just about how strong the passive is or if it can stack or whatever the problem is that president this sets that hoyo can just lock something as big as a global revive behind gacha and because hoyo is the biggest gacha game company other gacha games will follow suit so all this does is make the gacha space a already predatory space even more predatory
radortwyuwu i dont see how that cancels highly likely possibility of a limit like if not then at max or smth lol
hellmayor i think it will limited like at best global passive can be use in the battle like hi
radortwyuwu all the leaks about future global passives were fake we have to wait for reliable information
shodomch i dont think hsr is bad because what it does can make other games bad its like saying that you cant learn how to cook because then other people will cook too but fail
my friend i really appreciate your optimism trust me but you guys really gotta stop thinking that hoyoverse is a saint of a company and that they will be considerate with such changes this is the greediest gacha game company in existance that were talking about and time and time again weve seen how their greed is bottomless please stop believing that will ever change global passives might have a limit and if they do i guarantee you it will atleast stack a few times why on earth would they make a whole big box ui for it if its to fit just one row im guessing it will be limited to global passives active at once but regardless the game is beyond cooked
jokerofcards we cant do anything btw and i never expect this game getting slower as a years hi player i already get used to this shit
its really not impossible that they will add a broken passives now look at silverwolf bro before shes literally broken because she can implant weakness now look what we have anaxa can implant all weakness and aoe too
radortwyuwu um no there isnt that im aware of at all ive watched leaks and theres nothing about that from any reliable leaker or any at all or the dataminers
radortwyuwu you should probably go back and read the leaks properly becuase no that was wrong that ui thing wasnt for global buffs its not even showing castorices or anything of the sort the ui change that came just shows castorices global passive and thats it the rest are entirely false
tempestu but does he reduce resistances no so youll still be basing your head against ice res tell me you dont know in game mechanics
yulfine huh if the ui wasnt for global passives then why is castorices passive written there just for fun you are contradicting yourself
hellmayor having a limit does not make it any better the point is that they can lock stupid shit behind limited stars
radortwyuwu it wasnt its not even her global passive icon the element was added so people could more easily see her passive being active no data leaker has mentioned anything about any other unit or global passives any leak youve seen claiming phainon or hyacine or cerdyra have a global passive is currently false until dataminers tell us otherwise the same is said for cipher we already know her kit anyways
yulfine at this point im not even sure if were talking about the same thing there is a screenshot ingame of the uibox for her global passive look it up on the subreddit the ui is indeed for global passives
radortwyuwu that is what i looked up and no it wasnt for global passives that was a month ago and people were freaking out with the screenshot and then everyone moved on because it was just to show castorices passive to be active it was literally in the patch notes theres also evidence of any other global passives currently for any further characters until hoyo or dataminers confirm it because even dataminers said it wasnt a ui for global passives
shodomch you mean exactly like edilons its not a new precedent the game isnt catered to es combat
there no gameplay in hsr so its wheres endgame
mess
global
overreaction
mid
global passives per month for the funny just get it over with lol
sponsor get up to off on gacha game httpschainldshopggtdauow safe convenient all you need is uid join ldshopgg discord for queries httpsdiscordggwdhgdsvhrs claim your vip pass here
im so sick of people defending this because it not that op
star rail being a turned based combat is what turned me off the game never touching it ever for all of genshins flaws it will always be the more enjoyable game for me wuwa is great too
theres one bandaid for this situation it is by no means a fix however hoyo should give every player a free castorice so everyone has the global passive on their account they should just take the l and consider global passives a failed experiment and never make another character with a one ever again and they seriously need to find a way to slow down or eliminate this hp inflation that keeps getting worse with every patch
i only pulled for the dragon
this is why they just announced a new honkai game star rail is doomed
pulled because jp va is tamamo still quit the game
acheron is like gojo their mere presence changed the balance of the entire world making stronger enemies and other future characters stronger hahahaha
xd she is so strong you do not even have to use her
coming back to this after castorices banner is almost over i havent seen the passive in action once
bro i miss our four stars i dont think weve deadass had a new four star in months
wow i heard about the drama but i thought it already died i totally forgot about it but this video is the proof od how vocal minority think they are majority and how they are easily manipulated by videos and propagandas made to scare them the real problem that actually exist is ignored heavy powercreep and meta enforcement to clear even the story content but when something insignificant like this is happening morons in the community make it as it was the big threat same kind of drama was created when arlecchino got her weapon idiots there also were scaring everyone that this bad and other crap like you dont have to own it and now people are literally saying cringe stuff like they will hate castorice justifying toxicity and they think its fine the global passive changes literally nothing its just another reason to decide if you want character or not but thats nothing else its not something that will actually change anything if i didnt want to get castorice since i wouldnt and definitely such a minor passive effect wouldnt convince me and people saying its a new quality of character thats so dramatic and full of lies like its like saying archons in genshin should be stars they are clearly superior especially with furina being able to walk on water and stuff people didnt believe furina would be able to walk on water because its too op before it was even announced now nobody makes a big deal about it because there are no propagandists who say this is a threat and a bad thing but people tried to scare people with how bad arlecchinos signature is like somehow having a skin for character is okay but if weapon is cool when you use it with character is a scam same mentality there and here scaring people for something that doesnt even matter at all on top of that group of people think they represent everyone most people dont care and arent such incels gacha community is so dumb and toxic they enforce their own stupidity on others and think they are absolute right especially when thy are absolute wrong like in this case stop spreading negativity misinformation and toxicity all of you why were you ignoring powercreep for years but when one character gets global passive that is more like a bonus its suddenly bad thing why do i even say this obviously its like talking to antivaxxers they always know better than actual professionals
i have noticed that since the hp meta came back with tribbie enemies seem to do more damage than before my acheron would definitely not be able to survive if i didnt have aveturine i mean think about how much health tribbie has and think of tingyun and the memes about her dying all the time youre going to be tingyun without castorice or hp units overall
got es castorice in pulls got real lucky
i only log onto hsr when there are free pulls to be claimed as i like the characters and trailers and discussing said characters with friends who do actively play the game but the worldgameplaystorycombat is extremely boringskippable so i rarely ever play hsr just wanted to say that castorice design wise is fantastic i could care less about any of her abilities or whatever this drama is shes just a great design and so i pulled for her cause she looks amazing castorice jingliu lingsha sparkle xueyi firefly
as someone who wanted castorice so badly before her kit was even released purely for the design i am really sad to see that she is ruined by the greedy devs of the game and some players have even started to hate on her
i could see certain endgame modes that disable global passives
ngl i wish to see vars playing limbus and starts to make videos about it
whos guaranteeing that theyre going to add more global passives to the game
i pulled for castorice because i though she was cool but once i found out that shes been tied to global passive and the fact that my character doesnt die thats actually wild i dont know how to feel about it it kinda feels illegal for something like that to even happen
top up services are always a risky bet wouldnt recommend taking more sponsors from them in the future the only person i know that has tried using a trusted one they used a creator code with ended up getting their genshin account banned a month or so later they hadnt used mods cheats private servers or done any account sharing use at your own risk
these sites always seam so tempting for the cheaper top ups but at the same time they look so risky in so many ways
will they also give the same bonuses that the game gives when buying
jensei i actually got the double
and whos guaranteeing that theyre not gonna
from what ive heard about honkai impact global passives arent unprecedented apparently hi has them as well and they arent substantial in the least
lmao as fp as possible genshin its one of the most stingy gacha by far honkai is better on that point but still nowhere near the most generous and fp gacha uma musume is time more generous and fp than any hoyoverse gacha same thing for the eos since or revived witch same thing for pgr tower of fantasy i dont play it but a friend i know do play wuthering wave and its way better too i could continue to quote gacha that are way more generous and fp than hoyoverse gacha its not because worst gacha exist not that much for genshin its really on the list for the worst money grab scumbag gacha like dokkan for example that we can excuse hoyoverse star rail is at the middle of the ladder at best from the fp friendly point of view mainly because of how stupid the power crept and frequency of release not even speaking about the scumbag mechanic of eidolons so no hoyoverse doesnt make the effort to make it as fp as possible like i said i have tons of example of gacha who exist since multiple year that prove that hoyoverse could be way more generous than this and still be fine
where is the music in the end from
ive seen other people mention this but the real danger of power creep is that it is alienating it will push away returning players and possibly will result in less new players as well of course these arent issues if the majority of existing players stay and keep spending but once the exodus starts its gonna be ugly
i have no issue with it not like im playing other users online just cpu
if hoyo continues with making global passives i honestly think that letting an account have only one active at a time which the player can select at any time out of combat is the only way to not break the game
the worst part is the community told them from the very begining of the character beta and they just ignored it all it shows they dont really listen to feedback
castorice passive aint even that good those who could do sustainless would do it even without her and those who cant do sustainless wount do even if they have her not to mention that endgame isnt that hard people just either refuse to farm relics or cant read as happened with nikador
good to be me because ive never really cared about end game content and do that to minimum just because im lazy for something like that i do main story events pull for characters i like and enjoy it maybe its just people who needs to chill out a bit its still the small part of community whos angry about that because hsr is now top in some chinese games chart which means that if not you then millions of other people will keep the game alive they already had such anniversary spending event in hi and no one really cared but in hsr its suddenly a problem idk sometimes i feel like people making hsr drama just for drama people hated on acheron for her new animations and dmg people are hating on castorice for her animations and dmg people gonna hate on next year anv character for their animations and dmg nothing new
they really poison pilled this issue by burying it in a highly anticipated character and anniversary tooup resets and im hella resentful its ridiculous to see how they weaponize certain characters like castorice while leaving others nothing anaxa and tbh if i wasnt looking forward to my boy phainon id have very little to hold on for at the moment elysia be damned surely they have to know how much people at least in the west dont like this pay for power stuff right but that assumes they care at all about their reputation in the west lmao
am i the only one who thinks while it does set a ominus sign of passives to come castorice seems to be overhated since she does lend herself to a unique playstyle and lets be real here she is firefly levels of fp literaly all u need is a pela and gahlager wich they have apeared in numerous banners and the remembrance tb they even gave us a lc to build with the passive is not that great since skill issue but when my units die and resurect they get hit again so bascily if u reach a point ur character dies and needs to revive then u need to restart that run most of the time the question we should really ask is when new star we need that remebrance star for castorice and aglea
lol imagine caring how a casual single player mobile game does just dont pay dont play or dont pull on the character i just dont care i pulled algaea mydei and his lc and now cast and her lc i find it funny when people who have no experience in business especially mobile gaming decides whats good or bad as if they have yhe analytical data the release schedule is only an issue if youre an entitled or greedy player i have issues skipping cringe united like tribbie yunli and houhou stop acting like the game is hard i purposely run bad team and still clear mocaspf with full stars the only issues with the game are bad writing no skip button and no hard content also im a low spender literally just pay if i dont win my or no more no less so im by no means a whale nor do i go for dupes
i cant believe there are so many players actually praising this company acting like nothings wrong and some believing this is the best thing that theyve ever done and are so oblivious to the noticeably growing fact that this company is literally preying on them with no respect for players time and efforts
my problem is why couldnt they add a standard star remembrance as well also why cant we get any star remembrance cuz hyacine looks like a star imo
everytime i see this argument i bring up the following remember when acheron released and she is able to kill overworld enemies and everyone basically said the same that is is broken and they can now just remove all overworld enemies because all characters will have that now and in the end in was just her the anniversary character maybe just maybe it is the same effect here that because cas is the anniversary character she has a unique skill i am not saying it might not happen but all i am saying maybe dont throw the baby out with the bathwater just yet people are too quick to judge when something similar happened a previous time and nothing else came of it it was unique to only ever character
you should be friends with tectone
no bro video is a mistake casto passives cant revive anyone unless they receive heal or shield so you need always a sustain in your team she is not opening the fourth slot lol
omg is it like having a virus on your account
lmao majority of the players dont really care yall the loud minority here
or worse imagine a global passive thats only enabled when you e a character or something lets just hope they keep it an anniversary thing so you can at least plan for it
they do listen do feedback but only chinese maybe chinese players dont care
its not about the passive itself but rather the precedent that it sets i am tired of beholding people repeat the same over and over again it was never about her passive specifically
adriantepes bruh did you even watch the video the cc talks how strong the passive is i know people are complaining about the future potential but thats not whas video was talking about
her damage is exceptionally high which yet again leads to hp bloating
those fp losing are either gonna suck it up or spread their wallets for the first time
man if the hoyo increase jade per patch and makes lc guaranteed i might forgive them lol
im glad you mentioned the game being centered around the global passive hoyoshills are refusing to admit this if it is brought up hoyoshills ignore that this will happen its already centering bullshit around new characters in genshin nightsoul bullshit the newer weekly bosses are so inflated too it already seemed to be pushing castorice ahead of time back with harmonious choir that boss did massive damage and feixiao does even more
just look at gbf all of the archanegels there are mustpulls no questions asked there is no room for experimentation
the bitrate whenever castorice uses her dragon is hilarious
if they keep it to just anni units i really dont mind global passives as a concept since those units usually get special privileges anyways well see if it stays that way
imagine crying because of a character grow up its a video game you sooks
i have always afraid of turned based rpg because the reliance on the stats and skills available on the characters can easily powercrepts other characters in theory everyone must pull this character they will make enemies tha forced you to use this characters i do not like that kind of development
we have leaks for several characters already none have a global passive
i was wondering why everyone was freaking out about her
let me shed some light for the cute lil brains of those whose so called a player who cares for their favorite game logically speaking in turnbased games the difficulty is the selling point so lets break it down to two core points about turnbased gacha games selling characters with simple mechanics whats mainly being sold here is influence and story engagement but as we all know hoyoverse has trashtier writing only saved by solid execution selling mechanics and mustpull characters every patch obviously there are only two target markets hardcore players whales simps or casual players who in general dont really contribute much to the games revenue hoyoverse as a dev committed to its games not players still needs big fundingespecially after breaking off from tencent and you heard theyre cooking up another honkai title right that ones running on ue this isnt about balancing or caring for the players its about server sustainability no point in catering to fp or lowmid spenders if true whales especially from mainland just want their waifus to exist as they imagine sacrificing whales means hoyo runs at a deficit simple what comes next stagnation its clear hoyo wants to keep their game alive but theyre stuck in a player dilemma just look at how many revisions the casto kit went through that speaks volumes no need to compare with stuff like wuwa which is openworld or fgo thats a different story fgos surviving off player loyalty and its whales are consistent thats why it stays at the top of income charts hoyos playerbase mostly just casuals looking for a stress reliever they dont spend much and thats why hoyos in a pinch why do i keep bringing up whales because without whales the company dies period and dont think breaking from tencent means theyre on good terms if were talking domino effect theres no way your shiny new waifuhusbando wont get gp characters that are clearly designed to be hyped will always be given that treatment at least of new installs are banking on those characters getting gp thats just how it is thats the basic logic most people only think about how gp affects casuals and new players but if youre the type who rolls for every fav char every patch you should already understand the consequences so why blame the corp theyre just tailoring characters based on current market demands and what does the market want now waifuhusbu wars meta flexing character supremacy so no hoyo isnt wrong for releasing gp at the end of the day theyre just giving players what theyve been asking for this whole time ugh this games too easy bro wheres the challenge my waifu better be meta dude people complained the game was too easy so they dropped gp now everyones whining this is the result of players own actions
global passive dots can crit
be me barely played this game log in and see i have a ton of unclaimed rewards and freebies decide to use some of them on the cute purple elf banner get her within the first pulls close the game feels good man
its really harder with the chronicle wishes because this character i really want cuz when she hurts i had a chronicles going on theres a character that i wanted and i kept pulling for her but i dont know how many pity it takes to guarantee them and i wanted her for so long but im scared for i dont know if shell be good for the metal i cant unlock her materials
heya vars love your videos but i have to ask when is my girl rappa getting her own video
i feel so bad for pulling the new character because well i needed more of my account and she has been so helpful but i agree with every single point that you made that as a free to play player trying to keep up the meta is very very very very very very very very very very impossible to keep up and because i spend a lot of time away from the game because i started on the game came out but i stopped playing it until like a few months ago so its hard to save up enough wishes to guarantee a character like i had to get her after skipping two badges of really good characters i like the deals in the amount of pools you get in getting enough to do it because i cant unlock everything at the same time have been so helpful and im kind of afraid of what will happen if i didnt have her
power creep has always been an issue in gacha games but is this really all that bad
maan i wana quit but that fate collab thou
we have curios we got du equations we got global passive we get unit that gives out eidolon level to all your characters
i dont even play star rail i just watch these videos because listening to vars talking about literally anything is strangely calming
i also dont think that her passive is as impactful as people are insinuating non sustain is already something thats done youre just getting one extra mistake
two characters and they probably arent going to be wellselling ones i predict new global passive at the next anniversary character even a few global passives is bad
western ccs are so cringy one hivemind of whiny dramafarmer
theres the release of a unit in arknights drama lasted less than month after global and everyone moved on but power difference between her and the previous supreme units is as much as creatine to anabolic steriods not even close nearglobal range bosskilling main damage even though carrying only ammo absurd splash damage triple sprites that tank what your toughest tanks could not camoflauge for extreme survivability except some aoe attacks cheap deployment price quick charge cycle for that nasty skill and yet shes now verified as a not musthave for whatever reasons that the community accepted their games powecrept fate moving on i hope hsrs community gathers the will to forgive hoyos repeat offenses wallowing is not worth it
if i quit genshin for patches long i can still clear full stars on endgame content thats hard to say for hsr
its not that castorice global passive is op but rather its setting a new standard and in the future more and more global passive will come around and perhaps it will be a game changer
thank god i decided to not play this game become power creep shit show years is crazy from dev this size and experience
i like castorice as a character i actually really like her but not gonna pull her mostly because id like to focus on my therta team acheron team and fua team
coming to a video like this or the many videos that were out during the leak period so no one could look up anything castorice related without being spoiled by her kit i see so much disdain anger absolute hate for the passive in the comments praise for the ccs speaking out about it and yet so many of those very same ccs still pulled for castorice and even those that didnt still tested her made guides after talking ad nauseum about the dangerous precedent and how it would kill the game for themothers and then the vast majority of players simply do not care or do not see it that way and happily got their castorice as seen in the comments of literally any other recent hsr videohoyolabtwitteretc they did not care to change mydei who literally becomes an auto unit after you spend thousands for his e its their game its pve idk why people are acting like its weird or that they arent allowed to do stuff in their game even if it upsets us its not the first nor the last time everyone needs to actually decide if this will be that pivotal moment that dictates whether they officially quit or if they will continue to play from an actual design perspective its actually incredibly cool its honestly a shame people hate it but from the looks of it once they have a design path in mind they dont seem to deviate from it at all
i cant wait for her to eventually get powercrept like the other shilled waifu in this game
in regards to the hp inflation like im a spender have pulled for all but or characters have lcs and es on some but i still cant beat moc currently
now all we need is a heal global passive thats cooked
her passive nerfed her eidolons so bad shes good at e but at e its straight up the worst compared to other e like therta mydei or aglea
memokeeper of rememberance cas isnt a memokeeper
as someone who has spend money this patch and will be spending more but hasnt pulled since tribbie i must say ive passed the point of caring i want anaxa and preferably as many copies as i can get while staying below i was disappointed by how much love casto got compared to him but as a jingliu main im used to seeing my fav rot in a corner end game clear is only possible to a certain point and i liked amphoreus a lot i dont play to clear anymore i come and go however i pleasemostly when theres a character i want they can do whatever they want they will do whatever they want but they aint getting a single cent after anaxa is gone
are you going to talk about the complete lack of content in the game or is that not farming enough views
i left for months and only returned for anniversary rewardsif i get anaxa in the second half though ill probably actually return to playing again and drop zz because that man is beautiful
she got soo much promotion plot this chapter unique mechanics animation extra media and support characters she absolutely did not need the global passive i can see global passives maybe giving design space if they turn into a slot like you get a single buff active on your account and then qol bonuses from them such as increased basic attack multipliers ehr boosting dot and entanglement damage or boosting star character damage so rich dont get richer but gosh oof i doubt theyd make it healthy like that
the story refused to let a majority of characters who die stay dead and now its part of gameplay now too yay i already disliked castorice as a character she didnt appeal to me and i had to spend far too much time with her i tolerate her a lot more now with all the story about her but at first she was incredibly underwhelming and annoying for me now heres her global passive which id liked to propose shortening to gbp because i think itd be hilarious setting a dangerous precedent itd be fine if it was just her team accountwide is appalling
i disagree even if they dont do it ever again its still bad castorice could have wen live like this in an acceptable way only if it was a character reward for everyone who completes the amphoreus story and in no other way a star unit is just unacceptable the only good thing they can do is backtrack and make her so that you need her in team any other option is just us eating shit willingly
this game is going to the dump fast not fun predatory and annoying edit i find it hard to believe they are trying to make the game fp friendly if that was the truth the endgame content wouldnt feel so impossible unless you have multiple premium teams
me who pulled castorice times in one pull i cant die im invincible
have you seen chinese and korean gacha fans lol
hows that weiner lil bro
man and here i thought the whiners would stfu once the patch was out but nope gotta farm those clicks xd
why do those thumbnails look ai generated lmao
i love playing hsr but i just wish the devs listen to its players theres so much going on with this game to point where im slowly losing interest in play at at all and this coming from a fp
first paywall rider in genshin and now paywall healer in hsr
good video but zerosustain is not new
in the future powercreep more crazy like march th emanator remembrance phainon night and day mechanic everyone gonna adapt anyway like honkai impact enigmata
wait till they add a character that has global def shred passive
im going to say this global passive is a new mechanic and of course placing it on the newest anniversary unit is something that should be acceptable my greatest example is dokkan battle where the anni or wwdc units introduce a new mechanic get the new st monotype leader buffs nd anni nd wwdc category leader passives leader passives mechanics rd anni transformations th anni active skills th anni new leader skills th anni revives th anni intro skills th anni standby skills th wwdc field buffs th anni taunt skills th anni swapping unit feature all of the new units and even fp or standard banner units got one of these mechanics people are getting angry for a new mechanic which will comeback with more fp friendly units is it affecting power creep absolutely power creep cannot be evaded however honkai has this problem since its st anni and it should be addressed like acheron literally has a different ult mechanic and passive structure where you have to run nihility units to make her dps stronger we might get a unit fp or star options and well have some good buffs in my opinion we should get more fp friendly stars since we only got moze as a star and hes aint even fp since he works with fua and some people dont have dr ratio because it was a limited time event overall i can understand why people are mad and but its a basic gacha game feature that has happened and is still happening to this day honkai lacks a good fp roster and that we can all agree and i feel like we should get buffs also buffs for dan heng natasha and asta global passives will be accessible and im positive about it i can understand that a revive mechanic is insanely broken and bailu has it only for unit and she aint the best healer but its an anni unit of course shell be top tier again dokkan is an good example where most of the time the major celebration units were considered as the best units in the game and are the most of the time the top grossing same with saiyan day tanabata wwdc golden week goku day etc
eh i used my guaranteed for cas and i havent changed the way how i play the game i play it the same as i did before having her
hsr needs more reruns less releases and more
people being surprise about a gacha game being a gacha game
i been saying for a long time that this isnt going to be a problem theyre limit testing they will never add flat damage buffs to global passives because thats bad for business
honestly i wish we had more than two buttons as well as a slower release time of characters
i guess the original purpose of the global passive is to make units that could be easily powercrept to have some value even when they are no longer meta which is good at first glance but this creates more problems firstly this exposes the fact that the devs have no plans on buffing dps units since they still have some value when not being deployed secondly this kills the whole purpose of teambuilding if the effect lasts even when the units not on the field players will lose incentive to use other characters creatively or strstegically
so glad i quit this game early
the game is already unfriendly to new comer idk why people think it gotten worst when were already there since the end of penacony
i hate it sm i liked castorice initially but this blatant favoritism and tasteless fanservis made me sick
people already wanted castorice before the gp so hoyo got away with it people are also hyped about the fate collab so hoyo can get away with it again that would be the biggest fomo ever since they most likely wont have a rerun
sorry but you cant go sustainless using castorice youll get more turn and then die
ive been bored with the game since leaving belabog and the only reason i kept playing was in hopes of them going back to flashing out their story this might as well be the best time to quit
cause they are for the hoyo ones
first thanks for the video second normally i dont comment and content with just like but i really want to say it i dont if it intentioal or not but for some reason whenever i search for people say negative things about version results are always people happy about version as if iam forced to watch these videos instead so i wanted to ask am i the only one that happened to me or not note i dont believe in conspiracy but these results always happen to me sorry for my bad english
as a casual player i personally dont see the problem with castorice i play the game and obtain characters based on how i like them design playstyle and personalitywise so i dont really care how much broken or trash they are
i have the battlepass and monthly pass and i can still barely keep up with the moc have been consistently clearing moc until the latest patch where even a well built eoso castorice and a well built eos feixiao couldnt even clear it
its quite unfortunate i used to really like this game but its very obvious the devs stopped caring about the players and dont have any intentions of fixing things this game fell to greed a lot faster than i thought it makes me wonder how quickly zz will fall to it
got my c castorice
my personal reason of which i think castorices global passive isnt a good idea is because it simply has no cost the cost to using any other characters ability is rooted in them taking up a party slot a universal cost for every chraracter so far castroice goes and breaks that by having an ability which holds infinite value because of the passive having no cost associated with using it given how theyve implimented the global ui i do also agree that theyre more than likely to add more global passives and thatd have the same issue as castorices global where there is no cost associated the only way i can personally see them balancing a system like this is making it so that only a set number of globals can be active at once as well as possibly providing some free global passives because at that point globals will probably function similarly to lightcones things that augment or add onto your teams playstyle
honestly the fsn collab is one of the only things that keep me in this game i have been skipping the whole amphoreus for it so you can see what i really value the most its just sad that the powercreep is so strong in the game its hard to have fun when endgame tries so hard to shove characters that you dont want down your throat
unpopular opinion fps should not be able to full clear end game unless theyre the sweaty type last i checked mhy isnt an npo and afaik theres no evidence yet that theyre selling players personal data for profit so they benefit almost zero from allowing fps to be able to full clear end game id even argue that allowing general fps to be able to full clear end game would even hurt the games longterm health as a few vocal fps will definitely start shitposting spenders all over the place for not being smart and spent money on this game which you could have cleared without spending at all
hsr now feels like a generic cash grab mobile game like diablo immortal or raid shadow legends
god forbid a company catch a vibe
in thier defnse castorice is the chrysos heir of death so her global passive makes sense
im not a hsr player so i can say this as someone standing on the sidelines making a character have a global passive that takes affect even if they arent in the party is unacceptable if she had that effect if she was in the party then itd be fine it still sounds kinda busted but its fine but it being global for everyone forever that is not okay even if her buff was something insanely tiny like atk globally it still wouldnt be okay
in practice the global passive isnt quite as earthshattering as some people have tried to make it out to be not you vars this was a great breakdown having used it to push my limits in moc i can say it is super easy to basically get no value out of it it doesnt clear status effects so if you get a dot slapped on the revived character they die immediately before getting to exploit the passive honestly the best use for it is hoping a super slow character that provides an off field effect is the one that gets revived due to how much value youd still retain until you hit that healshield or die check jade with the poets set is probably the best at the moment
man im really getting high on copium and hoping that castorice is just a special snowflake and not a setting for a new standard
i got castorice because i like her character and kit i would love if they change her passive to no longer be global because i truly dont want it to be im going to continue building and playing other teams as if i didnt have the global if i can avoid it i might take use of it occasionally but overall im going to try not to
she power creeped even the log in animations
lmao imagine loving elysia
i have a version acc that ive been playing pretty much daily ever since it is impossible to keep up with content these days the power creep is too fast there arent enough jades to pull with the content gives so little for how much time it eats out of my day its difficult to be a low spender in this economy lmao and as strong as castorice is im saving for anaxa bc i already pulled for huohuo and im on guaranteed pity rn unless of course i suddenly triple the amount of pulls i have which is unlikely bc i dont have the money to be whaling for anyone im still using serval as my lightning dps and seele as my quantum dps life is hard
curious about kafka and blade buff if its pathetic that is when i uninstall should be atleast castorice aglea level
i am fp since the start of the game once i could star all of the endgame i could do it all the time even with the health inflation its just that bad floors would take cycles instead of most of the people with vaild concernes about what this might lead and what does it set are vaild but people sayin i cant cycle anymore the powercreap is the problem or tiktok teams whit crit rate and crit damage would tell you the game is dying are the ones bloating the issue and doomposting
that is not exactly casual
bro i started playing in almost fp ive never cleared moc still however i can complete pure fiction and apocalyptic shadow with stars
i guess moc will forever be impossible for me to star at this point
i mean i agree with you its just that even that doesnt cut it sometimes the hp of the enemies sometimes are so huge that even a top older character will struggle or fail to complete the content that a mid new character can
hachanneinzbern they had to push you into pulling new characters because thats the only way of garanteeing continuous revenue its not a highsocial game so selling skins just wont cut it
cym actually making the characters more likeable also helps with sales fgo had huge revenues for years even though the metagame could be mostly ignored
ya casotirce sets a bad precedent percent however i think you are way over hyping how good casotrices passive is a revive at hp still requires you to have some sort of heal then the character dies if not healed within turn its really not that good global passives bad castorices global passive not really good either
genshin subtly look at their characters who already have global passives since x
idk i am not as concerned as everyone else i could very well imagine that it was a one time gimmick since castorice has such a special place in the world to me its comparable to acheron and her technique the timing was the same and so is the type of charachter they both are in terms of both story role and fandom hype i also feel like it does not make a bigger change to your account and the game than other characters especially supports we had which make the game just straight up x times harder if you dont have them like ruan mei robin now sunday i think and tribbie so yeah idk id say chill tbh regarding the overall problems it would help if ppl could keep their wallets shut instead of going down the pay path as soon as they cant max star a content
grow up i bet you they are not gonna drop another global passive even befor the drama i bet you
global passives exist in honkai impact this is not the first time they have done this
now im worried that their way of buffing older units is by giving them global passives not necessarily making them better in battle but by making them more valuable to have in the account and incentivizing people to pull them on their reruns
at the end of the day if the game still makes money in the long run then it will prove to be the right decision for them it means they knew their market and it worked because i would like to believe that hyv just like any other tech company is making datadriven decisions so well know in time
hypothetical if and only if they balance the game around the experience of relatively new players then global passives can be beneficial for the longterm health of the game it will still be largely fomodriven and risky to say the least but ultimately if new players are able to clear without them then their experience will be quite fine players who would already have multiple global passives on the other hand wouldnt need to feel too pressured to pull for too many new units since they would be getting buffs from their entire character roster making it easier for their older units to clear new content regardless would this be better than just reducing powercreep probably not will they actually go this route i wouldnt bet on it
i mean they still have a lot but they are a percent of the player base it doesnt surprise me they want to squeeze the ones they have before they lose many more but seriously as a fan of mihoyo i hope they fix starrail the gameplay the story the characters zz did little tweaks in story and characters once released why hsr cant
let me play the worlds smallest violin seriously who actual cares i been playing games for about years so i understand the frustration and passion but ultimately its just a game imo i actually like her passive and shes cool if people dont like it then dont get her or just stop playing the game its that easy
cant wait for kuro games turn based rpg ngl
i get the main point of this video being global passives stuck to limited units is bad to this game and yes i do agree but honestly for castorices case her passive really isnt that broken it just saves you from resetting and is just more or less quality of life
i love spamming the seconds on the start of the vid so i can hear vars say honk honk honk
i pulled cause she has scythe im a dimple dude
didnt you see all that pw trash they added this version hsr is going down that path
i pulled castorice and was going to pull her anyway i just really liked her design and personality and it sucks that shes in such controversy because of stupid decision that the devs made there are so many ways they could fix the global passives for example only anniversary units have them so they come out once every year or so they could only affect anything except dmg they could also just make them unusable in mocas and pf lets just hope that whereever they are going its not toward their grave
hopefully they do something like being able to only have one global passive at a time otherwise this game is cooked
im kinda glad i quit the game a long time ago the main reason was that i couldnt go full time on both games focusing on both stories at the same time but im glad i did when i did coz i didnt have to experience the whole powercreep express
fck all people that reported wuwa just play your hity games and leave us alone
since when was castorice a memokeeper of remembrance kek
i disagree on one particular point this doesnt mean the game is ruined no it does i know i am doomposting here but lets be real for just a second when acheron came out with her weakness ignore mechanic what happened then more and more characters came out doing it even morefirefly feixiao and now we are just talking about castorice she isnt an emenator anyone spending money dring and after castorice incident to me might as well take a gun and shoot their own foot
glad i quitted then fuck dis shit im out
the passive itself is soso i initially thought it was worthless because i thought the unit will die again if they arent healed before their next action it seems like they do actually get a full turn first tho which can make it useful for sustainless cycles but you are right its the precedent being set that is the major worry for players and rightfully so almost equally scummy is the extreme whale festival theyre holding with the anniversary an event based on how much you top up is disgusting and theres no other way to interpret it the character shop is another one that is catered to whales i did actually get one silver companion spirit upon logging in because i have e bronya as a mo player but i think im in the extreme minority there i did pull castorice because i need a modern dps but over all im not happy about this anniversary
as fp my problem is more thematic i dont care about meta or late game content so if this leads to powercreep once i cant keep up i will just stop i play for the fun i have today so stopping in the future does not represent loss to me i have the same relation to games i do spend on i support the devs for the fun i have and not for the fun i might have in the future so quitting is not a loss not to me anyway what irks me is that all players will experience the story the same but some will spend tickets and that makes castorice like them more while those that dont spent she will just ignore what about the players that get her with single ticket why are they treated differently for such low investment why are players who lose ignored by her the devs make her look like golddigger intentionally or not
i see it as a positive makes pulling characters actually useful in the long term whens the last time i used jinglui dill jing yuan its been ages they are all wasted pulls to me now provide benefit to my account while someone like castorice will forever add benefit wish way more characters had global passives give silver wolf one to always implant a weakness kafka one to add an extra dot stackblade one to replace in game music with my chemical romance
sadly this doesnt matter to hoyo as long as money comes in and they see green nothing else matters people need to vote with their wallets but they never will in mass people continue to cave into their matketing same shit nintendo is about to experience u as a player dont matter until their revenue gets shot
loads of people on the comments act like hoyo is not a company that wants what money
nahh bad take
nothing in this game is getting better at this point its just wearing people down leaving the slop eaters in da weis farm banner is going to go crazy in terms of sales and whats the damage el risitas get the list brother we got some comedy here the story still sucks whats hours with more static poses did they really fix it i saw the white screen black text and then laughed so hard because of how backhanded that fix seems they already admitted to rewriting it but uhh maybe they mean a spending event great cant wait to see more of those i also like logging into directly to a new character pull now screen a terrible half assed fix at the system you can choose characters out of the gutter well maybe fu is still ok the worthless character exchange tokens that require you to get e standard character and then you need more lmao who is this for global passives the worst one is out a revive doesnt really do much but what else can you put on a global passive now here comes power creep more power creep all the characters are t wow crazy locking kit changing effects and team comps behind eidolons and light cones relic farming is still garbage and weve gone through band aid fixes a fix on a fix on a fix all bottled necked unless you pay wow who woulda thought dot continues to remain dead and forgotten literally if you just allowed dots to crit and also proc when enemies were attacked itd be fixed very strange i used those two specific examples almost like its in the game somewhere at this point im more interested in how much further they can go its like a science experiment i think its ok to allow people to be flawed and play this game but at some point you do have to push back when the company goes crazy the question is when and if
lol thats what they meant when they said castorice has a pull video i thought the video would appear once we pull her rather than just her splash art but this is just sad are they worried people wont pull for her im genuinely confused why are they desperate
you still gonna play
the dark dragon from final fantasy iv is all grown up
cipher better
pay to win rigged sloppy game enjoy the zero cycles have all e s looking ahhs
all this talk about precedents is just glorified doomposting
this is how i feel about emblem rings in feh
im fine with everything its enough for an anniversary celebration it doesnt matter as long as i enjoy playing everybody is getting crazy bout castorice being overpowered or destroying the game like that sort of thing i didnt spend any penny on this game but still i got all the characters that i wanted that helped me push to all the contents of the game and even made this only account i had stronger no stress and frustration of being broke with just a game
it not people are overacting my god
i dont think global passives are going to be a big issue goin forward
two things cas passive allows sustainless no it fucking doesnt sustainless is accessible to everyone the only thing holding people back is fear of not having a sustain on the team and relic quality youre talking like sustainless clears were impossible before they werent fps cant keep up with the endgame i am sorry but this is literally a skill issue i spent only once on a monthly pass and have been consistently clearing since or so when my account matured the real issue lies in account mismanagement and genuine lack of knowledge and i dont blame anyone except those who dont read out of principle i recently visited my friends account who couldnt beat the moc and beat it for them with sustains on both teams using just my knowledge
i think in this situation genshin has the better approach to global passives its always some helpful but relatively minor stuff like raiden making polearm upgrades cheaper or thoma giving more fish
yall should play wuwa d come well treat you better yall deserve better
next global passive removes lc path restriction s hopefully
it doesnt matter
this gane is hopeless i got cas she is terribly built with level traces and she cycled moc where my top acheron woth her bis team took cycles
i honestly dont care been playing for about a year never spent a dime and just got castorice shes an icon shes a legend and i think everybodys being a little paranoid about the global passive i actually doubt theyll keep going down this road i think they just wanted to do something super new as a way to celebrate the nd anniversary and will stop there
nah i have to disagree on this one
the global passive just isnt that big of a deal the point of of the game is not even dying in the first place and if you did then that means your team is simply too weak
i hope they make her passive a one time thing because she is an anniversary character like when acheron was released and shattered all the damage ceilings
im so glad i left the game in cant keep up with this shit hoyo wants us to pull for every character in the game atp
leaks there was a leak a few weeks ago that phainon will be having a global passive too
i know this is going to be sounding like whining i knew what was coming up with the anniversary stuffbut the way the game immediately opened up to a cg of castorice and go to warp i thought i was watching the version pvthey play it in hi when you update and launch but i was so flabbergasted by how in your face it was that i just am not touching the app it was justso in your face this is really trivial though this is sort of the writing on the wall i can tell really hesitant to keep playingi have spent bucks and its been a year since i began playing and i never have and never will spend again even though i think a fu hua type expy might come with marshal hua or cerydra this was justwhat
i think its more worrying to put a spending event in the game tying rewards to spending money is a bad precedent to set
i kinda disagree on fp friendly aspects since its by far one of the hardest games to go in fp from my experience feature exclusive characters with high pity is just super harsh when resources are thin and powercreep is especially strong
hail global passive
rather than skipping castorice just skip this game
while i do understand the issue on a whole i thought the entire point of gacha was to have characters that do different things than the previous the character passive isnt the reason why you cant clearyou cant clear because of power creep and hp inflation
so the only issue everyone has with castorice is her global passive ask yourselves this question and answer yourself honestly how often do your characters die even if they do you mostly reset because you messed up your rotation somewhere somehow not only that but her passive isnt even a full on revive when acheron came out noone complained her technique being able to instantly kill enemies but we all know exactly how good that technique is even better than castorices passive but i do agree about powercreep they are going overboard with enemy hp inflation even in main story sometimes enemies are really tough
i hope youre feeling better now vars
kinda unrelated but does anyone know what that zz video is on the right at it looks sick haha
because they are exploration passives not combat ones i think the only character with a combatrelated passive is childe with the extra level he gives to normal attacks but this only works if he is on the team so it dont even counts
i wish the global passive were like genshin too for example castorice should have been able to locate chests and puzzles like topaz maybe but for amphoreus only now i know it seems like a lot considering you literally dont have to struggle but guides on youtube exists too which makes it a little bit balanced
hsr is beyond repairs right nowhsr is the greediest among the big mihoyo games because they keep pushing the powercreep and implementing this global passive in combat to make players spend money frequentlyi hope zz will follow genshins powercreep pathgenshin has less powercreep but the game is still profitablei dont know what hsr devs are thinking after seeing genshins success even without powercreep and global passive in combat but they still implement global passive in hsr
jarrygarry powercreep is undeniable but ill wait and see how they implement the buffs to older characters that they promised
we cant you want to villianize us for being hoyo refugees there was an insane amount of vitriol and hateful rhetoric towards tourists and hoyo refugees following cantarellas trailer and a bunch of new ppl are getting banned left and right for being hoyo refugees guess well have to wait for endfield or ananta then
i think people got really spoiled by genshin impact if you look at hsr hi and now zz gi is actually the only hoyo game that doesnt have extremely high and aggressivequick power creep but its also their most popular and bestselling game youd think they would learn from that
maybe im dumb but i think that they could just say global passives do not work in endgame content unless the character in question is on field
is it just me or each update scream to me this is a business not a game for example unskippable castorice animation upon first entering the game minutes high quality extremely emotional anime episode dedicated to castorice which is also unskippable and the overall story being revolved around her and we spend the most amount of time with her you see what i am seeing this is not a story this is a hour long promotion ad for castorice and this is a more of a business rather than a game
would it still be bad if global passive are just for anniversary characters
its really kinda amusing how people when honkai first released were going crazy myself included though i didnt think it would derail genshin or whatever saying how honkai is so much more user friendly and generous then genshin little did we know that they were basically just front loading in order to on ramp people to the game it basically didnt matter how many characters they gave away or whatever because those units will be unusable in months maybe even less than that its a shame really i had high hopes for this game since i really like turn based and sci fi space theme games but they also screwed that up making it way to easy to auto play thru which is like whats the point in that
do ppl even tried her global passive before making these bait ass videos it doesnt heal u its legit a safety net for we reason her hp drain causes ur teammate to die it does not help ur cycle team be more reliable if it fulled heal after death sure but it doesnt use ur monkey brains at least
other than the new world being so boring to trek through this move with the global passive is whats going to keep me off from playing hsr which is my favorite hyv game
in hsr the story revolves around selling you gacha characters change my mind
i know you like to act like hi doesnt exist but it does and everything they did now in hsr was done there already game is still played and exists stop doom posting in hi they buffed older units individually to make them usable again still buff older favorite units of players to make them usable in part they have a bunch of global buffs they give away characters for free in different shapes and forms they let you buy certain older units with collectable tokens none of these broke the game in fact it made it so people can use their favs longer
i feel like hoyoverse is so inexperienced when running a turn based game their only way of increasing end game difficulty add more hp on enemies and let newer characters deal more damage with this hp inflation even if they do buff characters i think they will become irrelevant in a few months i dont care if new characters are op but i do care that my il danhengs k damage cant even kill mobs in end game contents that is how bad the endgame inflation is heading
what if they just slap a global passive to old characters they said they would buff
just saying ive been playing the update for a while and only once on one character has her passive ever triggered and then that was it literally bring a healer and you dont ever see it proc if it pisses you off ig unfortunately the implementation of castorices passive means that future characters might also have this feature im not trying to defend it i just wish it only worked when shes in the party
i think hoyo sees the regulations coming that will destroy hoyos predatory monetization
im not being hyperbolic when i say that hsr has some of the worst powercreep of a modern gacha i have ever seen lol if the character release schedules matched hsr would be on par with feh or crk in terms of blatant hardcore powercreep and im being completely serious about this
from our perspective its a dangerous precedent from their perspective its an insane revenue
it really says a lot that the reactions to global passives are at best neutral no one is happy about this you either hate it think it could be worse or dont care
nah its the best thing actually let the fp complain all day
this is inevitable the only way to stop the increasingly pay to win aspect is to push for lawmakers to ban gacha entirely as a business model imagine how much fairer for the consumer hsr or any gacha game would be if hoyo et al were legally barred from selling power and could only make money by directly selling cosmetics or heaven forbid charging a monthly subscription
once they start putting good passives on characters i dont want idk man
hp inflation is still the real problem and i wish people didnt drop that topic just because theres a new ragebait topic i couldnt care less if castorices global passive can one shot a boss if my previously invested teams from last year can still achieve star moc
a decision that the company hasnt made since i understand jenshin and now hsr are the only popular hoyo games ok i even like them and play them but dont act like theyre the only games they have buffed older characters in other games since
this is why they stopped with the character quests they put it in the main story so you cant skip their ad for the new banner
reminds me of firefly
its frustrating for me because i called it but people didnt listen just saying genshin could never whenever i pointed it out everyone was so happy getting what they wanted in genshin no one could see that it was a just a bribe to get people in and distract from its failings especially when i pointed out that a lot of freebies were a bad thing gatchas giving out free stuff are not doing it out of generosity but a way to get people into the game a just enough balancing act for its power creep and for when the game is not meeting revenue expectations or years old and player retention is naturally falling and they are trying to convince you to stay
star rail was never user friendly and generous thats the joke that was the lie by fanboys who just wanted excuse to hate genshin
definitly and for me penacony was the biggest prove of that since you had a bunch of filler characters that were there just to sell a banner sparkles boothill rappa fugue jade etc
thats literally every gacha
not genshin tho lewa
abhinavanand are you sure
thats evey gatcha game not just hsr
albedomikans when the gacha story have a skip button and doesnt give a character hours of screentime yeah
that hp drain isnt problem my opinion castorice is anniversary character but her kit is so boring meta over fun good luck
glad im not the only one who got pissed for acting like hsr and genshin are the only games none of these actions are new or game braking stupid doom posting hype
lmao im watching arcane right now havent got here yet
hsr became more predatory quicker than genshin they really managed to fuck up a turn based game i hope the people who pulled for castorice enjoy her for the versions until someone twice as strong comes out making her trash and it will definitely happen and then people will move to that character like the scums they are
global passives like this are a really cool concept for a big reward after a difficult questline or somethingif we were talking about a normal rpg where it does not involve spending money given the passive they gave castorice is not that strong to begin with even if you trigger the effect any slap on he wrist will still knock you down for good and a character going down realistically only happens in high difficulties of su this is never the reason you dont get stars in any game mode but a lack of damage output is the only problem as stated in the video is that this opens the floodgates for more effects like this
i would also be okay with it if the buffs they are planning to give to kafka jingliu sw and blade meant including global passives for them basically slowly implementing globals for everyone or at least every would be a good idea
its funny how consumers dont actually care about being treated right unless they are being treated like literal garbage cause who wants good quality when i can put a gold leaf on it and wow its shiny garbage now
as long as global passives are whatever like castorice i dont really see a problem in themdont bring me examples where new bosses either have one shot like attack or bring hp of party to one because reading mechanic explains how to stop boss from doing it or in case of new dragon boss we literally get healed while attacking boss it can go out of hand for sure thou but till i see signs of it happening i dont see big problem in that i cant read future
got killed in moc today got revived by castorice stars not sure how i feel
genshin does have global passives but they crucially provide no combat effect raiden and wanderers passives halve upgrade costs for certain weapon types
boothill is very wanted and appealing
hoyo never surprised me how shit theyre at deciding stuff when it comes to their games
i pulled for castorice because right now powercreep from global passives isnt an issue but if it does in the future then i will consider it
miss this game but its too much to go back to after a year off i dont wanna deal with only having what are now terrible characters and not being able to clear
harmony emanator thats for sure to get another global passive
im happy to see the ccs and their communities are in sync about the problems with a global passive its a shame that the vast majority of players are casual and likely do not consume content or media about the games they play castorice has some of the best animations in argueably all gacha and i really like her design however have still put my money where my mouth is and quit hsr but for most they cannot take that step understandable but unfortunate i can only hope this doesnt crack open global passive for other games but weve seen the system get popularized after genshin did it
as much as i like castorice as a character i refuse to pull for her and i legitemetely hope her banner doesnt sell and is considered a failure we dont want global passives and the only way to stop hoyo from doing it again is for her to be the worst selling unit sadly i already know thats not happening cause the discord servers im in are already full of people celebrating pulling her or complaining about losing s trying to
they better make an gameentry animation for each upcoming new character because if castorice is the only one that gets glazed by them so incredibly hard she officially will become my most hated character
the amount of people that dont get or refuse to believe that this is only the beginning is concerning
this is what favouritism looks and feels like people castorice has everything that we dont have
for them to make such an unprecedented move correct and that is sad it is pretty standard for gacha games to buff older characters fgo fate nikke etc this is quite standard but not for hoyo but if people only play hoyo they see and praise this thisisnt praiseworthy this should be standard and expected
boothill isnt very appealing market wise now what kind of shirtbag told you a thing like that
riguor but as you well said they are crafting and development passives that dont impact cambat at all so not having them doesnt put you at a disadventage another thing is crafting passives are optional as you can choose to not use them even if you have the character that has the passive but castorice isnt like that as her passive is both global and exclusively active you cant choose to not use it after you get her
i think they said itd be only her if anaxa doesnt have one im rioting though
you are not only player i played her trial castorice is huge disappointment to me even more disappointing after trial acheron is much more fun to me my opiniontrue anniversary characters zz vivian and hugo genshin escoffier and ifa wuwa zani and ciaccona star rail anaxa hyacine and cipher never castorice to me and dragon genshin neuvillette good luck for pulls
she is an anniversary char ofc they would glaze herstill not enough glaze for me to pull for her
heard anaxa isnt getting one but hopefully just because he debuts in phase lets hope phase has animations as well
if phainon who is the mc of amphoreus doesnt get this treatment
guys dont get the same treatment so i keeps hopes in the basement with screwllum
shes the anniversary character so
kyarumomochi but anaxa also
akarifuyuki actual anniversary started from this date hence why its only first phase not yo defend hoyo but this is what they did for all of their games
kyarumomochi i know doesnt mean i like it
akarifuyuki i literally states the same thing
kyarumomochi oh sorry i dont know
boohoo a piece of pixels made me cry boohoo
akarifuyuki the goat got it
the amount of people extrapolating bad outcomes based on nothing is what is concerning
alhosaintaher did you even watch the video vars says for now its not too bad but once more character get global passives it becomes a whole new game of whether you have those characters or not
renbananacatsoup then complain about it when it happens global passives can be very bad or very good depending on the direction the game takes saying it will be bad is nothing but making predictions over nothing once they become bad then we can make a big deal about it and i will support you but until then it is nothing but complaining about things that havent happen
alhosaintaher do you really trust a gacha company to do you good how is a limited global passive good in any way they already implemented global passives in a bad way when the character with an op passive releases then its gonna be too late prevention is better than a cure
alhosaintaher complain it when it happens no we should complain it before it happens when we know if something bad can be happen we should avoid it take the other better optiondirection lets use our brain
setetesairhina you should look at gbf the global passives are on every major grand characters and they are celebrated put on the top of tier lists they are willing to pay for those and let those hp inflation continue unabated if global passives are already more than ok there nothing here is gonna make a difference
setetesairhina then you are complaining about your imagination why stop there complain that there are no more free pulls in the future and that characters now need to be e to unlock thier passive that kills all endgame without playing it
everytime i see this argument i bring up the following remember when acheron released and she is able to kill overworld enemies and everyone basically said the same that is is broken and they can now just remove all overworld enemies because all caharacters will have that now and in the end in was just her the anniversary character maybe just maybe it is the same effect here that because cas is the anniversary character she has a unique skill i am not saying it might not happen but all i am saying maybe dont throw the baby out with the bathwater just yet people are too quick to judge when something similar happened a previous time and nothing else came of it it was unique to only ever character
grmtid that was an over world technique which had no practical use in endgame content this exclusive passive affects every game mode its essentially a different game that revolves around whether you have that character or not that is not even in the same league as acherons technique
renbananacatsoup no practical effect in end game content acheron made du super quick and easy to clear as well as any event that has overworld enemies with acheron you can complete most if not all story content without having to worry about health issues her technique is extremely useful but also changes the game if you have her vs if you dont castorice on the other hand if you have not experienced the moon cocoon effect yet is very nuanced and unless you finely plan to the last detail including when the boss will hit you will not help bit for the most part as an example i tested her skill and played really badly as i have actually built my characters and have sustains that keeps me from dying but i went and played like the worst possible and depending if you have luck and how quick your other characters are the effect of moon cocoon will be useless the following was the scenarios i found rmc was too quick so before my sustain could act they already got their next turn and thus they died cause unlike what ccs are telling you your character cannot act again they literally only have till their next turn to get a shield or heal if not they die as their turn comes around lingsha was killed during the first swipe of flame reaver shocking i know lingsha never dies but as i said i had to play super bad to see effect she got resurrected flame reaver went into second swipe and lingsha died sometimes yes you will get lucky and her skill can help but it is not worth throwing the baby out with the bath water over that possible chance that you might be saved by a unique skill that is probably given to her due to it fitting her lore and her being an anniversary character but her skill only works once so if for example the flame reaver swipe its swipes kill a character they get resurrected if he swipes again and that kills characters they do not get resurrected if i had to choose between castorice and acheron i would say acheron is the more broken mechanic and changed the game much more than castorice that is a good unit but has a buff that will probably if ever dependent on how good you play mostly work out on her party as she sucks the life force dry of everyone around her
whenever hoyo buffs an old character its hidden by a new limited character
fr like what the fudge
boothill everyday than castorice my opinion good luck for pulls
apdf definitely going for his next rerun
what sort of a son of a nice lady told him that
i like boothill but unfortunately for all intends he is a filler character that barely had screan time relevancy or any type of dedicaded event the guy dont even have a story quest meanwhile luka the random from belobog got one
truckkun castorice doesnt have one either they just dont do story quests now boothill actually took a big part in penacony and then in the story with rappa he has more screen time than t herta fugue rappa argenti ratio
ginichimaruan id argue that argenti and ratio had a bit more screen time than boothill
apdfi agree
this character singlehandedly killed any hope of me ever returning to star rail after quitting it version i was already extremely disappointed with what they did with fuge basically just shoving her into sundays quest for no good reason but all the hp inflation everywhere honestly was killing any interest in the game already you know your game is done messed up when even genshin is far more balanced yes im well aware of how broken mavuika is but people have been consistently clearing abysses with only characters out of being from version as an example whenever i fail at getting abyss stars i feel as through its my own skill issue not an issue of literally not being able to deal enough damage
where are the people that say hsr is so generous to its players
eh didnt we establish after release that casto global passive isnt really big deal before release i do agree and concern too that the next characters will have more meta global passive but looking at play now just feels like a nice qol you can get hit immediately after ressu with hp before enemy actions get hit again then it is die for sure its a nice safety net but still with chances and when shes on the party more safety net from the dragon but thats sacrificing her dragons hp thus lowering personal dps i think thats a fair game powercreep are there too so this problem would pronounce more on game like genshin or arknight that had really slow pace and took a long time for rerun heck even ak rerun banners are miracle while these global passive can be debatable now i do concern more on people who thought this time hoyo goes too greedy with a lot of anniv bundles here im questioning why they had less reward and less bundles compared to other gacha idk about hi but years on genshin years on hsr and waiting for zz i feel like they really tanking everything from the gacha revenue which is make sense but i still think they holding a lot on these bundles hsr do have problems but now im starting to think twice to engage with the community problems on this game i thought i can learn one or two about somethinglogical thinking from others now i cant differentiate between good argument and justwannawhineoneverything anymore does this how it feels like when people said dont engage to the community i think i understand now
just pull for game changer characters like castorice and stop pulling for crippled ones easy me personally would stop pulling after castorice and just wait for the next big thing also pulling for characters you like is the most brainless way of using your limited resources cox its not even an open world game like genshin where you can roam using you favorite character sheess btw hsr on the next gacha pvp will get top beating that prn game called lads and that pokemon junk
all hell is going to break loose now im still in shock that global passives are a thing there is already one thing for an upcoming character that is the subject of speculation and yikes
how many people actually play endgame if not much than this passive will be not all that conterversial it is for endgame players but i think this is something hoyo is thinking
this game is doomed i will enjoy it while it lasts and once it reaches that point of no return i will be ready to say goodbye
i still cant get over how people hate the passive yes its a global passive and yes it means they might do it again unfortunately but people forget its one revive per battle seriously what difference will it make if they keep stronger and stronger bosses nonstop besides mydei gets like revives and does the same amount of damage plus can easily solo content even at e so again what difference does this passive make like literally its almost as bad as the people complaining about mydeis auto battle niche heaven forbid a character is actually unique in gameplay compared to others i honestly feel like its the same with ac shadows and its just everyone being negative for no reason i dont live on the internet but i have noticed a huge increase of negativity lately whether its for games or movies or music or whatever like what the hell happened lately the internet today is filled with negativity and then borderline pronography with everyone being addicted to it like are we evolving backwards or something again i dont live on the internet or have any forms of social media which thank god for that so i honestly wouldnt know
precedent what if this what if that what if these what if those what if im so tired of this
i dont hate the idea of global passives theres only so much you can do with unique characters in a turnbased game especially when elemental reactions dont play as big a role but this is something that needed to exist from the beginning of the game and needs to be limited say you can only have one or two global passives active at a time something like elemental resonance from genshin not ideal but then i think if this was in hsr from the start and it wasnt so powerful right off the bat i dont think anyone would be complaining context i dont play hsr just genshin lmao im sorry if im missing context took one look at the game being turnbased and noped out of there and im glad i did
the only global passive in genshin is just thomas fishing passive lmao this crap better not carry over there
spoiler as i finished the story i understand now why shes like that she will never be seen again man haahhaah
next is they gonna make a global passive of giving the all the characters a speed something like that edit or atk and break effect
yeah i am part of the problem unfortunately this passive is a terrible idea and precedent but all the sales are too juicy and useful for me not to use cause i want pretty much every upcoming character thank god tho they are actually buffing units and also moved old units into the pity pool and gave a free ruan mei so frankly the scales have completely balanced out imagine the other game doing half of this
unrelated but can you maybe get a better mic setup your audio always has this awful reverb its jarring to listen to your videos as background noise i dont have this problem with other videos
milking views for a game you dont play
i am of the opinion that hoyo will destroy hsr purely based on greed and will not do anything to truly address any of the core problems what theyve been doing so far is introduce more powercreep or storytelling elements stronger characters with hp sponge enemies that require the character to even clear comfortably excessive yap and white text on black screen and are trying to bandaid it with character buffs that will be obsolete in patch and black text on white screen with how badly theyve been milking the game i guarantee you theyll make more of these permanent problems and offer temporary solutions until the game is well and truly dead
its already happening as i said in another video for me whats also an issue is that hoyo will scale hsrs endgame to the latest shiny unit they have they buffed the enemies hp for acherons release then feixiao and now most likely for castorice so she has an autorevive which used to be reserved for older units e that can activate even when shes not in the party gee i wonder if theyll release enemies with instadeath abilities or deal damage that can bypass shields and leave your units at hp wait a minute
its anniversary for hoyo not for players
genshin could never
people still clear moc with s it just requires good relics and gameplay
tfemrobin was it around tries with insanly good gear
ill try to add perspective and preface by saying to enjoy whatever game you want not judging you the people that feel her global passive isnt a problem likely just ignore the valid points people make everyone kept saying yes her particular passive isnt broken or godlike that isnt what people are talking about it is the obvious precedent they are making trying to normalize this which inherently makes the game and potential other gachas more predatory than they already are they already did this with genshin btw constellations that wasnt standard in gachas duplications in gachas traditionally just give stats and that is it genshin helped normalize tying critical aspects of a characters kit to there dupes and sometimes weapons which of course makes the game more predatory acheron troubling you with that nihility restriction wellet me tell you about her e similar case with global passives they dip there toes in the water conditioning players to accept it then gradually increase how powerful they become to entice more money and resources it is standard stuff not trying to be toxic or hateful towards you btw if you enjoy the game and castorice more power to you please enjoy any video game you want just offering perspective maybe you didnt see what people meant because plenty in the community are ultra toxic and pad there criticisms with a ton of insults hopefully i conveyed this respectfully to you
godofgoblins o yea ya you good thank you even yours doesnt sounds aggressive and more reasonable i do wanna add too that i dont really follow news casto doesnt grab my attention not pulling her so when the global passive news pops up everywhere i thought maybe this is really a big problem even i dont look for it the recommendation are everywhere so it spark my curiosity on how casto played out after release and thats my comment on that now i think about it yea genshin copies do give value on actionnumber compared to others that just give small stats but whats predatory about it isnt that how developer get creative with what they sell and how it give player another experience from the chars i play genshin fp and still feel rewarded without copies plus theres no need for cons or even sign weapon i think this is the nd game i played after ak that doesnt made me feel pressured to pull every banner i cant say the same for hsr some chars made me need to pull sign but it doesnt hinder my progress on end game still all clear gacha nowadays just need to gain game experience and manage account better right or i am missing the point cause i just start reading here and there about game and how they perceive just around this year
so you realize the second part of your sentence is countered by the first part right you literally just said it the issue isnt the power level of the current passive everyone basically agrees it isnt ultra powerful or a big deal it is the precedent it leaves for them to obviously push for stronger ones which leads to a more predatory environment than it already is and its hoyoof course they will they can go ahead and release a global passive that does some def shred you dont counter the argument with ok but i have a character that can def shred again you need to see the obvious bigger picture here before you know it they will start doing global passives where you get an extra turn and you decide to say ok but bronya can give me another turn so like look just like how they try to normalize constellations in genshin this is another means to try and make the game more predatory to make money its simple not hating or judging you btw if you like the game please continue to enjoy just stating the obvious yes it is an issue but if you dont care that is fine enjoy but if you dont understand why its an issue hopefully i elaborated on that a little
you did not watch the video the problem is not the passive but rather what it represents today is a revive tomorrow it will be crit and the day after break damage and then def and hp and then more and more and more pretty much the only thing i do agree with has to be the social media part filled with negativity but everything else is wrong
so tired that whatever predictions have happened are true yea this game is ruined enjoy castorice for the months while she is replaced by a better character
riyozsu no im tired of this absolute victim mentality that have been plaguing yall its almost as if you lot have been asking for these to happen if anything
then why are you here
winstonlin no actual arguments be reductive instead
pollux allow me to introduce myself
hsr could never
i think people forget that even global passive can be designed in myriad ways that can be less offensive like increase crit rate by for two turns or need two abundance to increase heal by it really can be designed to be less game breaking and not as annoying people need to really stop this level of fear when it hasnt even happened
great first a dangerous president of a certain north american country now a dangerous precedent of a certain passive of a new character whether president or precedent theyre all dangerous
love seeing how people say its just a pve game they were the same one complaining about the hp inflation and the dangerous powercreep
well good fucking job hoyo you make want to play other gacha game excited for ananta
didnt know about castorices passive until now but in seeing this i do feel like the most likely outcome is a pretty simple one having played genshin since day i know what a dev who barely pays its community any notice looks like and while the dev team of genshin gives us things we want four to five years down the line hsr is pretty quick to listen and in my opinion has been doing a pretty good job of it too i think this way castorice has this passive to be cool and themey and to apply fomo fomo that i suspect is fake because while slightly worse id suspect that the next tb is going to have a similar passive lets say its abundance itll be slightly weaker to incite you to buy castorice on reruns say the deaths door effect is only cancelled if healed to full or shielded of their health kind of thing and heck maybe doesnt even require tb to be in abundance it seems pretty thematic that the benefits of abundance come with consequences you cant get rid of its kinda yaoshis whole thing
i think the thing that pisses me off about it is that rather than owning it hoyo is going full there is no war in ba sing se on the whole situation like it doesnt even register as a blip on their metaphorical radar
i really do think that global passive isnt a big of a deal first of all this is a pve game if it was a pvp yeah that would be a broken ability to have second there are other characters that have unique talents or mechanics that give quality of life improvements in the game acherons technique being able to delete mobs without entering a fight fireflys technique being able to easily delete the pigs for that mini game in the simulated universe ruan meis also has a bonus in su topaz or hertas that can locate chests you get the point third even if you revive you have to be healed or shielded asap otherwise the character will die and if you die in this game then you should consider rework your team or tweak the builds of your characters not saying is a skill issue at all but if i die in a battle i often restart and try another approach
would yall stop grifting on the global passive its not a big deal ffs
the unique passive is not that much of game breaker unless you have some very speed tuned healers which i guess hyacine will be but thats up for air it happened to me several times on du and opponents are so fast that the revived party member dies again immediately and it only happened once per battle in long term boss raids it could be clutch but considering they also upped the speed of enemies plus most of them doing stray aoe attacks yeah the usefulness just drops significantly i guess it was actually busted before with multiple usage per battle and a hefty sum of hp once revived but was super nerfted from the beta experience backlash im not defending it its still an awful system im just saying that people are getting too riled up over it unless they make another one that heals a party member on very critical hpin conjunction with this now thats when we really get mad
dude whats the point of adding spoilers
itd be interesting to see if they do make global passives for the purpose of buffing older units it could be a way to revitalise the early roster heck maybe our general will get a buff this way too
i pray that hoyo somehow shuts down
genuinely if i dont like the char i will regret pulling i got castorice and really regret it bc i dont like her however her global passive did make me force myself to pull plus shes a good teammate for mydei idk i felt reallypressured to get her and it sucks
once you obtain this character when therere enemies with hp their hp will be depleted entirely this skill is active even if the character isnt in the party after obtaining this character when teammates energy needs were nine or less to reach max energy this character will provide the needs so they have full energy this skill is active even if the character isnt in the party
a huge mistake with a huge income this month cant wait for my monthly gacha pvp and see if hsr beats pokemon and love deepspace
it isnt a big deal whenever i did die in moc the run was over its just a pretty animation it is cool tho
i quit the game before even found out about castorice global passive im feeling very vindicated right now
also adding another dangerous precedent the precendent that hsr team wont listen to community negative feedback even if the feedback is loud and clear since they could get away with it lol
castorice is my favorite character in the game and i got her today shes so amazing shes already doing k damage like i dont even have all her traces maxed out yet like i pre farmed for her and shes doing pretty well
something i really wish is that they would finally allow characters to have more than one skill and an ultimate theres only so much you can do with two options resulting in overloaded kits for new characters and the game feeling more restrained with time
people love doomposting
cas itself is fine but what will the next global passive be speed get extra true damage per followup attack get additional crit rate for each turn you arent hit by an enemy energy gain time will tell
again its not the passive its the problems that come after in the future
are you coming from the future
if i say yes would u believe me
yellowleaflc perhaps lol
yellowleaflc hey and im coming from the past i think acherons ability to destroy overworld enemies without fights will destroy this game think about it they will now release every unit after acheron which will be able to kill units without ever engaging in a fight with them there will never be any gameplay now
but the thing is archeron cant kill big mobs and her killing isnt global like in the cutsence like she killed adventurine imagine if they actually do like what i said ill suck da wei dickk all days
mr pokke will instantly pull for that first one
negative feedback from some of the community youd be surprised how few people really care
fluwmir these people who ignore the situation be like i love casto shes my wife so i dont care about the passive because i anyway will have her on my account let just wait to see their faces when hoyo will starts implementing such a passives for the future gameplayshitty characters like incoming anaxa
fluwmir perhaps doesnt change how valid the existing feedback is though few is relative and considering how much traction this topic got its definitely bigger than other community concerns and if they still dont listen because they consider it still few people caring thats all the more a dangerous precedent
the only feedback theyll listen to is how much money the castorice banner will make
youd be surprised for the amount of white knights who thinks criticism is bad for the game
guyonyoutube sadly seems to be the likely case but i am holding out hope theyve been known to listen to community feedback in the past
some of us want the passives xd
quint and youre entitled to wanting it the same way we are entitled to think its a net negative with all of the videos points and more
whats interesting is that the only community that really cares about this are western players apparently players in cn or asia dont care very much about the global passive at the end of the day it sounds like hoyo care more about their local cn community than globaloverseas because they spend more
wizirbyman the cn community is already fustrated enough over powercreep and hp inflation in moc global passive isnt even worth probab second priority discuss compare to how the character powercreep insanely i remeber see a vid of comparing csignature lightcone jingliu vs the herta and the discussion about the powercreep stacked up in the comments
wizirbyman ive heard the opposite some sources were saying even the chinese side were generally against it during beta that they thought theyd roll it back which made it more surprising they didnt
if it came from the cn player base it would matter
nobady cares about a loud minority of clowns in global games was top for days in china jp kr etc hoyo doenst listen to clowns that get their ideas from cc drama
guyonyoutube this is true people criticized the mavuikacitlali dual banners in the same phase and it resulted in over million dollars in revenue for hyv so yeah they called the communitys bluff and sadly the community folded
oh castorice is getting a global passive well its not really good oh shes getting an anime styled pv okay thats good i guess she got three asmr styled videos thats a good place to stop shes going to be the one to save all of amphoreus okay alright she got a her own unique loading screen its enough slices
how did my guy complain about something in a gacha game whilst promoting a topup website hyprocite at its finest
i have a feeling they will give a free unit that gives a global passive to soothe the pain of ppl still playing the game then release another absolute unit with a good global passive
this comment section is infuriating so many people assume the worst about everything
to be honest the problem isnt hoyo or the power creep is the player themselves they are just pay and pay over and over at this rate hoyo cant even see any problem with that look the players are paying and having fun and they actually make an auto character that you cant even control and people still paying for it if people stop paying and make hoyo at the edge they will start to see the problem and see the content creators videos and start understanding the problem because they dont play their own game
ok but realistically i think it will be a one time thing acheron the previous anniversary unit is the only one who can skip entire fights not as impactful but it is a one time thing
the worst thing is hoyoverse is going to see castorice make a lot of money because of the topup and how hard they were shilling her and executives are going to see the sales and interpret as people wanting more global passives
bgm from fire emblem
the thumbnail is pretty tho castorice is pretty
realistically castorices global passive is a qol at best its a safety net for when an uppity amphoreus enemy scores a cheap oneshot on a member of your team its why i expect any future global passives to focus on accountwide qol my prediction the next global passive will be an ehr buff as its a notoriously difficult stat to build around and a major weakness of the nihility path
i stopped playing months ago and im so glad i stopped there were so many characters i wanted in order to complete end game content but the insane power creep this game brought was too much and dailys became a chore along with the events plus no skip button
this whole patch gives greedy the game rakes in millions yet hoyo feels the need to blatantly leech money off its playerbase who have a cultlike attachment and admiration for the game theyre also doing a blatant tactic where they test the waters with a new mechanic and either continue making these global passives just as or more broken or in an attempt to manipulate the playerbase into thinking they listened they will make these passives slightly less impactful but will still not remove them completely cause they know sweats will still pull for even a attack boost see honkai impact rd i used to enjoy hoyo games but the greed is biblical levels i wish people held gacha companies as accountable as infamous companies like ea as their money practices and nickelanddiming are shockingly similar its sad that a company i was willing to give some leeway to for the overall quality of their games have sunk so low but if you give a download theyll ask for
at this rate what happened to acheron coming up soon
honestly even if global passives didnt exist powercreep is real and some crazy wacky units will probably surpass all these characters in the future
i cant wait for a global passive that gets stronger the more copies of a character you have
the fire emblem heroes shade
the issue with all this powercreep is new players wont have all these limited characters that are necessary they will atbest have limited characters and a standard star with a bunch of stars that will suck
okay im just saying to those who think the passive aint turbo broken ive been able to clear moc with her passive alone no sustain
i have castorice and her unique passive is useless
they dont even care about the blackscreen they literally changed it into white lmao
fr the favoritism is crazy i feel bad as an anaxa fan watch him get only pv and no lore trailer
viixine boothill situation all over again
and shes not even a real flame chaser were only getting of the original its stupid no moebius not even worth playing until elysia is out
istg if phainon doesnt get this castorice treatment considering that hes like the mc of amphoreus
viixine na the worst part is he is dead before he is available
at this point shes a mary sue
armadan dumbass its a different universe tf do you expect
shes not saving amhoreus she didnt even do anything memorable in quest shes just a bland boring character
qihwjsishwjsdb shes pretty good story wise but hoyoverse is glazing her way too hard and its kinda not her character problem but how she is executed
bro the one who saves amphoreus will be trailblazerphainon we know that since literally phainon is glazed in the story as the savior though im not surprised that conspiracy theorists arent thinking straight
you would have to pray for hoyo to even care a little about their male characters viixine
dont be naive corporations cant be trusted to exercise any level of restraint
artisticcannibalism smh
dia_d_auth youre the one who clicked on this video and decided to insert yourself into the conversation take responsibility for your actions and stop complaining
artisticcannibalism my fault for expecting people to be more reasonable in the comments
dia_d_auth i apologize for my earlier comment i had you mistaken for someone else however the discussion and conclusions are reasonable you just dont like the obvious conclusion
artisticcannibalism its a pessimistic conclusion
dia_d_auth sometimes people are correct to be pessimistic this is one such case hoyo is a corporation and like any other corporation their goal is to make money and theyve been financially rewarded for their decision here
they dont design a ui for a time thing
the difference is that acheron can only skip fights against trash mobs which only saves you time meanwhile castorice passive could save your mocpure fictionwhatever run if you get randomly oneshot
i dont think theyll do stat buffs it will tiny no consequence bonuses like with cypher on your team there is a chance for regular enemies to drop relics or whenever a character is healed apply a small shield at the end of every cycle the lowest health enemy is hit with an arrow dealing true dmg etc
yep but the problem is that most of the chinese communtity have no standards and no backbone they fold like paper with just a couple freebies
im just grateful hsr isnt made by ea because if it was then you wouldnt even be able to attempt to play moc without paying a fee and youd start with cycles left and have to pay to add more
shes getting a buff when cipher comes out
shh we cant let hoyo get ideas
you just gave them a dangerous idea my dude
what about global passive that only actiave if you of spesific character like exodia
swwl each of their sig cones are required
swwl that would be fking crazy but i think people would still go for it lol
the next global passive can be immune to all types of ccs when encounter cc the cc effect will be dispelled and converted to a doublebladed buff this would def blow things up
my bet is entire game modes will be locked behind owning a gacha character
swwl characters all e with their signature weapons cause why not
waiting for the global passive that adds a skip button
then just play the game for longer
if the powercreep is so bad then wont having just one new unit be enough for them to clear the game
you need two teams for all end game modes and you will still need sustainers
no ones gonna stick it out for months to get enough characters to know if its fun for them
luckiestluck then just dont play it why complain when you can play a better game with less power creep
thats how it works for every gacha game out there tho for new players like how the hell you play a gacha game for week to month and expect them to dabble in endgame content already the people that play the endgame didnt even make of the total playerbase too and this is before said hp inflation were a thing
that how the game work buddy not just star rail but all game is like that
yeah i dont think people in these replies get it every time some player comes back from like say a month break the meta is just always changing and the limited characters they had before are now useless and so they feel tempted to pull and spend money so they can keep up with the meta thats the strat for them cause at lesst in genshin you can definitely do many of the games progress with just stars honestly
this meta only affects the endgame tho you can still clear story and events with old characters heck old characters can still even be used in moc but only up to floor floor and has always been stages for fomo for the new banner characters and its always been like that ever since floor and got introduced you only miss out pull if you dont clear floor and its not that deep man
mysteriousdora month break for what might aswell quit
oh idk maybe because of simply just burnout in general are you really gonna be playing an rpg game for what exactly i cant imagine actually not getting tired of this game unless youre a whale and also it probably couldnt even be just months fugue was meta for one patch and now shes literally useless
itsbiox yes why do you think i mentioned the break im aware its endgame thats the issue in itself are you sure im the one making it deep when you just tried to explain the moc to me regardless it still doesnt change the fact that old characters are just getting overshadowed left and right
mysteriousdora you only miss few pulls if you cant clear endgame jades for moc for mocand for moc which is just and half pull you miss month worth of jades but concerned about and half pullreally
the game isnt just relevant to moc theres still difficulties like boss fights or a couple of weekly bosses you most likely would need certain star characters specifically at least a good support to withstand some of the mechanics that bosses havs
mysteriousdora you can adjust the difficult if you struggling complain and complain did you really play the game you can easily clear the story boss if you really build you character and read boss mechanic for example you need aoe or blast character to win dice game in aventurine boss and dont forget there no cycle to win the boss story so you can stalling as much as possible with sustain if your character keep dying
issue is end game has a lot of the gems especially if you dont min max by doing every event and all the crappy side questsexploration and even if you dont bother with floor and are being made significantly harder than it was just a year ago
zensenmoyatte no im just gonna skip and play another game that respects my time instead
luckiestluck what months the permament pulls in the game are like new players can even have stronger teams than you returning players is the issue because you will have exaust a lot of those permamnet rewards
i have a sneaking suspicion thats just there to make you think of how useful it is watch it be completely useless outside of that boss and in the future they do this all the damn time it doesnt make the situation better because its just about the six week fomo cycle again
missed the point of the videoo
herrscherofkugisaki wouldnt that also mean that future characters global passive would also be useless think npc think
xenosaber what an insanely foolish thing to say why would you trust the corporation infamous for its power creep not to do the thing that it has already done repeatedly
artisticcannibalism cause i dont really care its that simple
xenosaber if you dont care then dont get involved in the conversation this is easy
wait now theyre blinding us
oh great now my oled screen is gonna get burn in minutes faster gg hoyo
to be fair the black screen still existed but i wanna say i saw it less than ten times in the quest unlike
no we are not lucky that the first set of global passive is in a wanted character hoyo only made castorice have the first global passive because they knew they could get away with it castorice was beloved everyone wanted her anniversary refreshed the shop and gave motives for people to waste more money so ofc this month will be their biggest revenue ever in hsr story which basically means they can add global passives without any trouble because they did it first and it sold greatly
we all know this isnt going to kill the game we all know this will sell well we all know this will only get worse we all know people will continue playing they are going so hard on her in just about everything from animation release window power and how many ui animations that she is a first for and honestly i think its because they kinda know this game just has its looks going for it at this point as gameplay is so stupid simple that if it didnt look good people wouldnt care anymore so they went all out with her because its all she actually has that will last nothing she does even her global passive will last because she will be replaced by hoyo themselves soon enough
once again nope this will not become a problem and the fearmongering is getting ridiculous
this is why i cant take any of yall seriously crit rate sure jan
dude is still yapping for views
hsrs only value to me rn is watching my friends stream their pulls tbqh bc i havent touched it in a minute
damn a reference from arcane
a friend mentioned jokingly that there wont be a because by that point hsr will have throughly exhausted the following points players paitence for bullshit ideas for new characters ways to balance everything
anyone who cant clear endgame in hoyos games is a subhuman skill issue
im sorry but i cant take this video seriously when your sponsor is ld shop a top up website for gacha games this whole controversy is so wildly overblown and i cant help but not care anymore when so many content creators are trying to make it some kind of moral obligation to skip castorice its just a game if you dont like whats going on seriously just quit and play a different game criticism is fine but this topic has already been completely beaten to death and now its just annoying they added the passive its in the game its not going away the best thing players can do is put their dissatisfaction in the surveys at this point and hope that hoyoverse sees the backlash from there
what sucks is that castorice has a genuinely good kit design i love the dragon animations and her playstyle is really interesting and has its own pretty intersting decision making and planning but whos to say she will still be relevant a year from now i still got a good amount saved for phainon and the fate collab and that will probably be the last chance to keep me invested in the game especially with endfield most likely releasing this year a game im really hyped for and hsr is the game i would drop to make time to play it i can see an argument that the global passive keeps her relevant even after she is powercrept but i dont want my future characters to get reduced to a passive after a couple versions
this is basically the optimus prime question from transformers freedom is your right if you make that request we will honor it but before your president decides please ask him this what if we leave and your wrong basically no one has a problem with castorice global passive for now because everyone wants castorice but what happens when they bring out a character no one wants but they have a broken passive that you need to have or else your cooked
is intresting that so many ppl have different options about her i mean i pulled her and dont even noticed the passive that much and before i was doing all content without her and the op characters only with characters i got from pulls and does are what ppl say are weak i mean i use gepard and he does his job good as well bronja and houhou and mydei and he does auto battle what is fine for me i mean yes the passive is not a good idea i know but when you dont like the passive dont pull her i pull her bc i dont really care about the passive that much my most run team is mydei gepard bronya and houhou what is intresting i mean i can beat most endgame content and i am free to play since i start playing honkai star rail
get castorice cant level cuz no material go play du best run i had sustain gets one shot on final boss instantly revived by castorice win
im still playing just because i wanted to get fugue to try boothil at his full power ill stop playing the game soon i so regret spending money on this game and will never spend in a hoyo game again
the only way people would have naturally accepted the global passive is if it was tied to rem trailblazer rather than cast price as a unlock after beating the most recent story quest boss would have solved the issue you noted about its availability at the very least
man showing fire emblem heroes lol now thats real toxic powercreep
people seem to forget that theyve been breezing through end game content with just playing auto and not thinking now people are actually have to think how to full clear moc the endgame mode is designed to cater to new character this is not something new ive struggled with recent end game content and i racked my brain to full clear it i do want a good challenge but this seems almost impossible as for future global passives i think its best to tone it down thats not ground breaking and make it so you can only select one global passive ensuring that castorice doesnt get the only special treatment and fair for future character global passives gacha games are inherently predatory this is no surprise pull for whoever you like not what the meta dictates there is no future proof characters hoyo does need to tone down the recent moc as the rewards doesnt match the difficulty of the challenges even with new units it is still hard to clear them the only thing we can do as a community is to give feedback such as what ive provided earlier pull for whoever you like and dont let anyone judge you for doing so dont feel guilty for not getting the character you wanted and spend your money and pulls wisely
this is a turnbased game theres only so much they can do i expected global passives or something similar to have been came in the game meta cost money if you are unlucky just play the game again this is a turnbased game you cant do much anyways other than attack on your turn wait to be attacked activate a ultimate and have a followup mechanic they need to add something else
im not even fp but even while occassionally spending for the charas i really like it has been really disheartening to look at the clearance lineup of friends when i cant star clear moc and and to then see that all the people who did manage to do it were using whatever the latest new dps was skipping therta castorice and tribbie to go for es mydei now means that i cant full clear moc even on attempt or because of course the weaknesses on the enemies and even their special mechanics are tailored to fit the newest releases
shes not really loved she didnt have any intimate interaction most of the time she was just there but hoyo made sure she was in every scene of amphoreus which makes all that investment in how she fare in the meta and the amount of animations exclusively for her
which makes me think shes more of a fomo situation than a desired character for her development
nothing will beat hsrs launch which made over an estimated million across all platforms
bensxed i agree she is there mostly to look pretty her personality is bland to me and quest is more focused on anaxa than on her it kinda reminds me of firefly also didnt do anything memorable in quests looked pretty thats all but surely characters like this sell very well because people like pretty characters and strong characters character is pretty and strong profit personally i dont care about castro im pulling for nax
why do you assume they care about balance in pve gacha game bruh they would sell a acheron bikini skin if they knew the simps would spend dollars on it and i dont even want to think what they put tribbie in if they could get away with it yall give big corporations way to much respect
seven trust me the only reason they dont put bikini skins in the game is to keep the rating pg for the kids with unsupervised parent credit cards because i guarantee if they do the skin will immediately sell more than actual characters
your friend is on some great copium they pull on mobile only min m a month and on great months prob m
genshin killer mentality from your friend i heard similar bullcrap arguments from people hating genshin you guys arent original with ridiculous hate but you are amusing that you actually think that you are right
talking about su i swear like of the blessings are great for castorice every night buff works great on her running anyone excluding medei during night is ass its like the new su is balanced on castorice
potatochip same
potatochip its fireflys du all over again
if they wanted to keep the same passive they couldve have catorice give rem trailblazer a blessing or something physical in your inventory that you get after doing a certain amount of the story
fire emblem heros makes castorices global passive look like childs play all thing considered
if this is the max they could do then they should give up on this game its not hard for billion dollar company to make great characters they just want quick money as soon as possible by making lazy characters like this slop
dude the second half of moc atm is fully weak to imaginary its free for mydei first half is doable with a jing yuansunday team or a jade team if you have them
thejh i tried jing yuan sunday jade aventurine st half no dice not enough damage i go down to cycles or less acheron team with jiaoqiu and pela no dice the shadow things survive firefly super break no dice shadow things survive and murder the team eventually jingliu blade attempt was even sadder mydei can do nd half fast with bronya robin luocha but not cycles fast
thejh to me it seems jade can only do it if she is with big herta
this damn powercreep shilling the latest units without them its impossible to clear endgame now lets see whos the latest unit there oh mydei
tehpathy i really dont get what youre snide about here
barasmin mind posting uid or mydeis stat
mydei has a free cycle second half i have no idea what ur on abt
im snide about you crying about people using the latest units to clear endgame while you yourself have a literally latest dps unit with a copy and a sig saying that you cant clear
barasmin this current moc first half is not really that hard like first off you need to understand how to damage the flame reaver properly when he summons his shadows you need to kill them all at once so always always save up your ult and everything and only ever unleased everything when he summons his shadows
tehpathy my issue is that i would have needed all the latest dps first half of moc is asking quantum or ice dmg and it needs dps that can hit enemies at once or you dont get the shadows in time to me it looks very much like youre meant to clear with the herta or castorice which i dont have and dont want of all people on my friends list none managed to star clear without the herta or castorice that is my gripe here and for nearly all the latest pf and as if i cant clear and look for what others did it shows me that all my friends who cleared did it with units i dont have so i can go f myself for not pulling those units
itsbiox my one aoe dps with the right element is jing yuan whose lightning lord does what it wants so if the timing is very important to break the shadows that may be why i cant clear before it goes down to cycles i hadnt thought of that
barasmin yup its alright you can retry that and take the advice in mind ive seen too many people blame that everything in hsr is hard now because of the hp inflation but keep in mind this hp inflation only affects old enemies like svarog and the propagation bug that usually shows in moc while the newer enemies always has some type of mechanic to justify their hp increase like nikador and this recent flame reaver where both has special mechanics to kill them quickly
i cleared by min maxing my old units last pull i did was sunday
barasmin hey i just want to put in my advice as well but it is going to be a bit more general since someone already helped with the reaver fight which i will say does require you to only do aoe attacks when his shadows are up never when hes alone if you need skill points this is the best time to do basics i cleared this moc with st acheron es jq es pela fu xuan es nd firefly es ruan mei es hmc s dd lingsha es this was the first moc where i was truly stuck because i didnt have the correct characters until i completed my acheron team with jq one thing i will say is that mydei sustainless is completely viable in this moc you can replace luocha with remembrance mc and youll see a major difference and i am not exaggerating if you want the sustain replace robin and put her in the first half probably replacing jade for the classic robinsunday combo also dont be afraid to look on youtube for jing yuan clears especially for the reaver because even though this game can be a character check sometimes you have to check your stats and your gameplay first before finally saying this moc is hard trust me i tried many teams before settling for this see other peoples jing yuan stats which are shown in most videos sure some of them has tribbie but sundayrobin can suffice good luck if you havent already completed it
people yap too much about this if it happens it happens if you dont like it then quit if the game dies it dies simple
can you make a video about the sad state of hunt units i just feel like the path as a whole is rendered useless when units like castorice herta anaxa mydei etc can do insane single target damage along insane aoe damage easily destroying both single target and aoe content while hunt units excel at one they just feel borderline useless and this is coming from a feixiao main with a extremely heavily invested fua team
funny you mention rappa even though she will definitely get the ratio treament for reruns
theyre pretty much adding a new rarity to the game characters with global passives should be considered as for all intent and purposes i remember they did something similar in another gacha i played magia record they added special units that had passive skills that could affect your entire team something never seen before it just ruined the game completely and eventually you had to have all the characters with these passives if you wanted to clear the hardest content not to mention pvp but at least they were limited to being used while they were in the party this is just so much worse i can imagine the state of the game in a couple years there will be so many global passives stacking up on top of each other that your account pretty much has cr er spd break efficiency etc and new players wont be able to clear moc stage because of how many characters youll need to deal with the monstrous hp of everything this is not the end its the beginning of the end
version hell even version s rate of powercreep was already frankly absurd adding in a global passive is like the omen to a catastrophe your comment on enshittification is scarily accurate and has represented star rail for the past year now the worst is simply yet to come
ive played star rail since the beginning of the game i am completely ftp i have never been able to fully complete any game mode and with the hp inflation and all these new broken characters i dont have the pulls for i doubt i ever will this game is quite literally made for whales i quit recently and seeing the castorice issue completely validates my idea that this game never has and never will be fully accessible to ftps
ok first off what deathimmunity theyll all be dead on the next turn when there are zero sustain units because it literally says if hp increases then they wont die so how can you run fullon dps team like that
in honkai impact there was a similar system where you would get a global stat increase based on if you had a certain star weapon or not however you didnt have to pull for some of these weapons and could earn them through playing also their global passives were not as game changing as cheating death rather you would gain more hp atk or crit rate
the sad thing is that she wont be relevant next year anywayssince they will inevitably invent a passive that will borrow a passive from another hoyo game character probably that is probably a next step or some shii
people saying you still need a supporthealershielder i see castorices passive as fate grand orders command seals while it is nice to have it takes some of the team buildingstrategic aspect of the game out because you know you have a safety net if for whatever reason you fucked up or are just one turnnormal attack away from a win to me taking strategyteam building away from a turn base strategy game just makes me not interested again i loved hsr but since the all res pen stuff and implant weakness my love for it has been in decline and the way and how they implemented global passives just made me quit
global passive bs made it to live so hoyo isnt seeing another cent of my money
all the standard banner units should be given a global passive
even if global passives are a success for hoyo the game is really stale and boring theres nothing to do and since endgame is just an advertisement of get a new character youre screwed
you are a little late to the doomposting party the passive itself its not important it doesnt really change your gameplay if you dont have a sustain ready you revived char is gonna die again one moment after and those sustainless comps only work when your team is hyper invested from the get go for example e s plus supps also similarly invested mostly cycle clears maybe it can help if you get unlucky at the last second and all enemies decide to target tingyun at their last turn but in any case if you are whaling like that you are already playing a different game that the rest of folk the precedentslippery slope argument is fearmongering its just a what if what if they do something bad in the future well if they do we can complain at that time no need to get hysterical now i woulda prefer they didnt add this passive just so i didnt have to hear the moanings of a vocal reddit minority fueled by content creators for over a month
you really dont need to play clips from the animated short in a video about the characters kit please leave it out in the future
words cannot express how disappointed i am to see that people will spend money on this character when he will singlehandedly kill the health of the game i dont trust them to not release more global passive in the future they will also probably allow enemies to one shot you because they will expect you to have castorice the powercreep is already bad and this is the last straw for some players including myself i personally dont want to play anymore unless they fix this
next a global passive that adds a th slot for x amout of turns or some ship
i have no idea how their games have been doing revenue wise compared to the past but oh my lord this patch feels like they are desperate for money it icks me massively
i opened hsr today to be flashed with a castorice vid and the multiplpaid eventslightcones and characters they really arent even hiding the fact they want money and at this point they couldve made her banner the whole patch to milk it
there is an easy solution to castorice dont pull for her
they love the game thats why theyre criticizing it they want hsr to be better idk how hard that is to understand they cant quit because again they love this game second is some of the players who also hates the global passive already spend a sht ton for this game
herrscherofkugisaki boo hoo then
meta shift hits hard not gonna lie this aoe focused one is not great for hunt but my es fei team robin aven topaz all es cleared second side moc in cycles still sure not as good as or cycle from some time ago but not terrible either
chirikain its not just the meta shift its just the insane restriction to do what aoe units can easily do with less effort and especially new units with less cost
buddy i dont mean to be offensive but thats skill issues im fp too and been fully clearing for a long time now
chirikain gotta agree with you here been playing since the game came out and have only spent about on the game all of my stars are e and i intentionally skipped some light cones to save pulls as i relied on some really good star light cones with all of that ive still been able to clear some of the hardest content in the game all simulated universes have been cleared on max threshold and have even been able to full clear moc and ap depending on the enemies on occasion would i say a really good character and their light cone would have helped me clear better of course but would i say theyre absolutely necessary to even have a chance im not willing to go that far
haha no offense taken yeah i must be doing something very wrong lol
i think it depends on how you play the game for casual players those who dont care about end games and only play for the story and characters hsr is still fp friendly
thats fair thats fair im a casual player but i want to be able to clear the content
its not even game changing if you were already clearing endgame content then you probably dont even need it if you were running sustainless theyll die almost immediately again anyway and if you were running a sustain with how strong enemies are now if your characters do die theyll probably die again even if they get revived its occasionally helpful in specific circumstances i would rather take increased stats thats always helpful than the revive
you can turn it on and off tho
only if they provide a way to get all of them guaranteed
when those old limited characters didnt even go into the standard banner and the only way to get them is to lose is crazy to me not to mention their lc
svarog jumping in from the sky the moment an enemy hits an underaged character
they are buffing the old char right still havent heard any details might have to wait till for them final passive buff
tristanwalhain lmaoo i want that so bad
yanqing has already a global passive which is being annoying
yellowleaflc i dont think they can legally add them to standard banner has to do with how the marketing works
you clearly missed the point of the video to type this and neglect the real issue
vectory you clearly didnt read what i wrote cause i mentioned that what ifs and precedents arguments are bs
chirikain what vars doesnt know is that this is a hoyoverse blueprint honkai impact did it genshin did it with natlan characters global passive is a problem because supporting this will help them go further in the predatory practice they created being pessimistic and fearmongering is not the same thing at all this is an issue right now
vectory genshin has global passives remember raiden with her global passive where it took less mora to upgrade polearms and swords
oh i expect them to massively increase the damage output of enemies now
good riddance
_thestormthatisapproaching they already did after aventurine got released some bosses will technically one shot you unless you have a ton of hp so you are forced to use a shield
xenosaber stay in your game then i dont need your opinion
vectory good thing i dont even consider any of your opinion valid
yet youre here getting pissed at his opinion funny isnt it
_thestormthatisapproaching who said im pissed holy projection batman
thats ironic yall good riddance nerds are just so easy to read lmao yall be watching videos criticizing your gacha game and scrolling through the comments to search for a reason to get pissed at something but keep acting tuff if that makes you feel any better
_thestormthatisapproaching nice projection have a nice life its not wrong to say good riddance is it
yeah and as expected youve got nothing interesting to say just wasting peoples time later gator
_thestormthatisapproaching answer then
welcome to gacha games nintendo wants to say hello as well
doesnt seem desperate more like they realize how excited people are and want to take advantage of it
hoyoverse games are still doing miles ahead of wuwa and as of today hsr topped the chart of multiple asia regions china sea korea and japan seen from a video i saw in cn community and cn community doesnt really care that much about global passive
wizzythedizzy how is wuwa even relevant to the current conversation no one here mentioned it if it was relevant wuwas revenue is almost always guaranteed to be on the lower side due to its gacha model
wizzythedizzy are you happy star rail is earning much money after having anniversary spending event and a whale shop are you a whale do you want more of this
eszterfodor no but this is hoyoverse we are talking about if they earn a lot no pushback from cn community you can rest assured they are not going to change there is nothing we can do
they have been topping the charts for over a year thats why theyre this greedy they know they can get away with it
the fact of the anniversary rewards are behind a major paywall like noy even low spenders get anything worth while its purely a whale only event
i didnt know it was this bad lmao
accountthatexists is the number you pulled out of your ass and there is no other explanation like i hate the spending event myself but the only items of value are the shop thing which is literally whale targeted system to begin with the rest is a giant nothingburger also its literally just one event on the side its not even listed i think unless you open a shop xd doesnt change it suck but wow a spending event have a pop up icon when you open shop crazy anyway what fp players like the most pulls guess what isnt paywalled wow you guessed it all the currency and pull my point is if you hate something at least do it with a proper argumentation and not rage over imaginary problem that you quite literally just made up lol
just swipe your card simple you want it hard you pay for it
nah that would make too much sense lmao
tshegofatsosekololo guys good news i got castorice es at around pulls so yeah good game
kurisu congrats
tshegofatsosekololo i literally just download it again after a year guess id be here in a while
the game is just an ad for castorice
eszterfodor in fairness the entire game is just an ad for its characters just by the nature of gacha games
tani proper argumentation bro hea just talking about how little you get from the anni event what do you want him to do make a scientific study on why the rewards feel bad
ah ye my bad that if you dont get free c and pulls it feels bad my fucking bad xd no complained about previous anniversary rewards people were even happy mocking how genshin could never the rewards are fine nothing major changed compared to last time you just have unrealistic expectations for what they should be at the end if youre so butthurt by it just quit the game cause its clearly not for you if you expect to get literally everything for you and anything you get is never enough reminder you willingly play fp gatcha game that makes company money by spending money in it so again expecting company to give you everything for free cuz its anniversary is quite literally setting yourself for dissapointment lol point is could they do more ye was it realistic no and even if they did get you more free pulls you fuckers would be here complaining anyway just cause its nof free castorice
i was looking forward to getting some free stuff playing a fun event and reading the story and pulling for anaxa not getting told to pay for stuff to get xyz free thing that probably isnt even a good deal im fp
theyre essentially putting paywalls on stat boosts
i recently started playing this game with the knowledge that it is powercreep central so im not bothered by anything they do but i get its frustrating for people who started early on and had any level of trust or higher expectations probably feels like they were mislead and spent money on a false premise or something
this is straight up delirium if you know even a single thing about hsr endgame this will not affect efficiency only quality of life so you dont have to make runs only it will never replace a sustain and if you think so you are delusional
congratulations to hoyo because this thing is what made me stop spending on hsr and this says a lot because im a huge hi flame chaser fan
people who dont like the global passive should just quit and stop complaining
i think that spending event its the devs just telling us that this is not a casualfriendly game its for whales and thats it
i find this just a bit sad i havent been keeping up with star rail but the story and the turn based combat is something that i have been feeling like returning to and when i want to return i start hearing about global buffs hidden behind pay walls making the game even less accessible to a free to play player like me my teams are already super dated and even if some characters i have get buffed i just feel like i couldnt keep up so when i already had problems in penaconi with my teams then i just dont think its worth the effort to get back into it honestly really sad since i was really enjoying the story when i was playing
crit is a horrible example think more in line of hi it would probably be atk or hp its not good but hi has been this way with even worse powercreep for years this is a honkai game after all
what i find mildly hilarious about the global passive is that it also just doesnt work out in your favor sometimesjust doesnt matter practically all relevant enemies do more than one action during their turn anyway be it fua or just flat out doing more damaging actions in a turn that even if a team member dies and gets revived theyll still be killed anyway because you have no way to survive or even interact with multiple attacks like that and you just end up dying anyway i know this cause it happened when i tried moc after getting castorice things just attack way to much and way too hard now that its become an arms race of scaling damage mechanics and overall bloat to the game where therere just way too many things to keep track of and surviving this shit is just too much to ask sometimes
unfortunately castorice is going to easily make over million between the top up reset the spending event insane character animations global passive and the general excitement for anniversary patches shareholders are going to see that and say yeah you need to do that again regardless if its bad for the games health the sales are the only thing that matters and they made certain it was going to be a crazy revenue spike
my true problem with global passives is not only the problems it can give to hsr but also to the gacha industry as a whole we all know that modern gacha games tend to have some mayor inspiration from hoyoverse as a whole for both the better and the worse so if they see this passive being successful we may see it in other games kuro games is a great example since their very beginning they have been taking some heavy notes from hoyo as a whole what will happend to wuwa once they implement global passives or worse their future hsr version you can also come to the argument that that wont be the case because kuro is hoyo but better so that wont happen argument and i wont debate whenever or not thats true because thats not the point point is what will happen to other gacha games that look at this ananta neverness to everness black beacon azur promilia my only hope is that future gacha devs will either see this and not try it or that the chinese government puts some sort of law that prohibits this kind of passives and before you say anything yes im inhaling copium for this
i always suspected star rail could go this way because most gacha games do sth to a similar vein create an exclusive skillpassive or just make the char a must pull anchor by making them ridiculously op its such a major problem bcz its a hoyo game
why you promoting dangerous site like ld shop are they associated with hoyo if not thats asking for potential bans
the rate of hsrs powercreep is scaring me while yes i have a job and could top up for the new units hoyo keeps on releasing every new patch that does not sound like a good financial decision since that would imply that every month or other month i have to spend
pulled castorice and lc hope will get e until end of banner
the only reason i reinstalled the game is because castorice has a dragon i swear thats the only reason and i am really pissed off i fucking love dragons so much and the moment they decide to add a dragon they also decide to shit on the game i just cant believe how fucking unlucky i am thankfully wuwa does have my back with jinshi and i trust kuro would never make something like this with their current track record but still even ju is an eastern style dragon not the more cooler looking western style dragon bro i am really mad right now this comment cant do my anger justice
i really dont think its a big deal it only matters to min maxers if you just only go for the chars that u like then there wont be a difference
i think theyre gonna follow the hird divine key road with this one and if thats as far as theyre going its honestly pretty negligeable especially since a lot of divine keys are free so its probably not as big of a deal as it seems
lets not ignore the fact that castorice poaches the entire fp break engine for her only fp team meaning cas players not only need her and her lc but also a team of upcoming supports to free up their break teams again
i dont really trust them not to add an actually useful global passive after seeing this new spending event
yes we all acknowledge that powercreep in a gacha game is somewhat normal but the speed that they drop those powercreep is way too fast and too sudden to the point that u barely keep up with it
not really a false premise a majority of the players are just greedy and stupid and pull for every new shiny character instead of planning their pulls
doing something with times less attempts is literally an efficiency gain
luucx no its not and efficiency gain is when you clear cycle faster when you clear in same amount of cycles but use less of your time it doesnt make the result anymore effective from gameplay perspective
same i used to like the game and buy bp every patch but after damn
welcome to gacha games maam
speak for yourself
grayewicked notice how the op used the word i im me yeah because they were speaking for themselvesuse your brain
grayewicked wisdom chases you but you are faster
im not gonna sit here as if people havent been having this disgusting activistic undertone on their comments but sure you do you
grayewicked what are you talking about there is no undertone in ops comment all i pointed out was that the op was obviously speaking from their personal experience
phycyo sure every anecdote is a personal experience until the community starts mobbing i mean just look at all yall currently
grayewicked oooh here comes the white knight defending the billion dollar company did that make you feel good do you want a cookie or perhaps pulls
it made me quit after almost years of playing and i was not even fp
emmasmith where have i actively defended hoyo
emmasmith where have i actively defended hoyo i havent
if you are really playing hi you know they have the worst powercreep and they also hhave spending event you are weak and no idea what hi is
grayewicked i was speaking on hoyo and you just jumped so either youre being a white knight or youre just delusional either way im not interested in those brownie points youre desperate to get
emmasmith hey im saving yall from yourselves enlightening you with another solution which is mindfulness but im not a bald person forcing my ideology on others yall can go gang up on me like a v on a podcast and thats understandable and to be expected
grayewicked no one asked lil bro
emmasmith right and no one cares about your rallies spawn of gachaslop and kektone
grayewicked bro are you schizo
grayewicked haha hoyo defender
omg really they didnt invest millions creating a game for people to play it for free oh wow thats shocking
chirikain its almost like the game earns like million dollars a month stop being an idiot please
chirikain the multibilliondollar company isnt going to date you bro stop making excuses for greed
chirikain kid i say this as a business owner even if only small while yes you run a business for profit not for charity its still reasonable and positive to respect and value your customer you shouldnt treat your customers badly and while giving preferential treatment to vips is almost mandatory that doesnt mean you should then treat your minor customers badly and its a fact that fp are customers for the game called hsr just as much as whales and dolphins even tough fp dont invest monkey directly they invest time in the game that impacts positively in player activity stadistics as well as they make free publicity and community both necessary for liveservice games so hoyo isnt entitled to implement bad directives for the games development just because its allegedly more redituable its bad for all their players not just the fp and i would dare say its also bad for business in the long run even though most greedy blockheads will say that it makes bigger numbers now as those numbers likely come at the cost of customers trust and goodwill
the token that u get after e someone already said a lots
i mean you get pulls as fp in days thats a free go to another game and check how much you ger there it still gives more pulls then most other games just saying
u forgot wuwa just gave out free stars at the start plus the plus ish pull then they proceed to gave out another limited star at patch or sth yeah hsr gave more pull than other games righht not to mention a free star weapon too ohh wait theres more weapon banners are guarantee
ggthalock pulls in days you sure about that last i checked i only got around ish as an active fp unless youve been hoarding since previous patches please show us the math kind sir
trebull not to be a kurobot but while youre generally right i wanna make a couple of corrections kuro has a precedent of treating players well since pgr which came out half a decade or so ago kuro is also not a big company they have seen relative success since wuwa but make no mistake they were nowhere near mihoyo in terms of how wealthy expansive and successful they were until wuwa and even then hoyo has nearly successfully monopolized the gacha market youre acting like these two companies are equivalent when one is incredibly rich and the other has only just begun to see success please bffr
even though genshin is stingy and has a lot of flawsi respect them for not giving power creep as horrible as thisgenshin is more casual friendly than honkai because at least the characters from years ago are still usablehsr is more for whales if players want to experience the game fullyi hope what they did to hsr in term of powercreep will not effect genshin and zenless zone zero in the future
i feel like the game is still extremely free to play friendly but just very gacha dependent if you want to full clear everything its a fun casual game if you dont care about all of that
hido are you kidding its a very fp friendly game if you dont care about anything to do with endgame in and the game barely had any events just the usual endgame reset and simulated universe how can you say its fp friendly when you can only pull character and not even sure its going to be the limited version sure if you dont want limited characters or endgame you can watch the story on youtube at this point
eszterfodor dawg i got no idea what youre even on about i havent even played the story since penacony started i just do everything else and find it fun one character per version i find generous ive played a ton of shitty and genuinely predatory gacha games in the past so maybe my expectations arent high for gacha games
if you want to play a turn based game go play a real jrpg not this coomer slop
jrpgs arent as convenient story based games you have to sit down and actually play a mobile game like hsr you can get on do some grinding to level characters or hard content at any convenient time
ive seen so many people saying itll be egregious like a def ignore or yeah that crit rate but from what weve seen with a revive itll be something small and hardly noticeable more in line with what you said i was thinking atk or hp lol not to mention i think the frequency of this implementation will probably be relatively far and few between based on character importance and popularity they gave the most popular character almost everyone was pulling for anyway the global passive someone similar to her would likely get the next
if youre running a nosustain team as vars posits here you cant heal unless your healing is provided by su blessing or a light cone or something therefore your affected units would die after taking action
angeldiaz thats why he literally said edge out an extra turn he didnt say the global passive is going to give fucking extra cycles
funny how most of that revenue can barely be attributed to the global passive but theyll spin the story saying oh the gp sells
thats what irks me about this so much they added this controversial passive to an anticipated character of course people will pull for her when shes a belovwd character or a character that obviously has an appealing concept summoning a big fuck you dragon even if she isnt meta this will artificially inflate the sales to even those who arent meta slaves i just hate how they handled her that it makes someone conflicted on pulling for her
its kinda sad how the anniversary is completely overshadowed by spending events and top up deals
ogmechsftw thats what makes the global passive so stupid simply she doesnt need it to sell she has a nice design godly animations and uniqueness
all the new tabs and event pages looks like a casino
natlbg to be fair theres not a lot in the anniversary anyway so
thejh im waiting for more events cause im confusion
not sure what you mean by shareholders hoyo has always been a private company i agree with everything else in your comment though
this is unfortunately very much true however as nihilistic as sounds that they will just global passive the game to death if we as a fanbase that cares for the longevity of the game go to the feedback page and flood their systems with disapproval yes theyll listen to the numbers that she sold millions because she will sell but if you wish to see this game last well into years do not spend on her banner now and instead not spend all of anniversary or spend it all on anaxagoras or the rerun banners on top of the feedback it is the only way that even something remotely will be moved at all because casuals will not give a shit
thejh yeah like a dead anniversary xd
and they gonna do it again and again and again and again they will sell global passive and mock people who like certain character play certain playstyle and invest on it
yeah i am part of the problem unfortunately this passive is a terrible idea and precedent but all the sales are too juicy and useful for me not to use cause i want pretty much every upcoming character thank god tho they are actually buffing units and also moved old units into the pity pool and gave a free ruan mei so frankly the scales have completely balanced out imagine the other game doing half of this
lizardkingrequiem u forgot that the buffing units arent out yet and the scale has not balanced yet the way they do this is not a permanent solution instead it just a bandage to a peace the players hiding the bad shit that they about to do next in the future
neokatwastaken i was scrolling hoping to see someone mention this
mihoyo doesnt have a single shareholders they are a private company more than of their revenue goes to the chinese founders including dawei and cao haiyu the most problematic one the remaining shares is split between ppl who invested in them in the beginning including sky mobbi which is part of hangzhou miyi
mindless consumerism won the day again my wallet my choice and people be doomed
eah this game is beyond cooked
i doubt it will make million many players already quit and the castorice trailer which acts as the main advertisement for an anniversary character is lacking enough views compared to other hyped characters on their day
natlbg first time seeing a spending event on a gacha game you twit
yup i already maxed out the top up might as well since ima spend it anyways might as well get more for my money
cantarellafisalia lol must be your first gacha game dont look at nikke xd
voledae the worst thing is hoyoverse is going to see castorice make a lot of money because of the topup and how hard they were shilling her and executives are going to see the sales and interpret as people wanting more global passives
we getting top up reset which day
hoyo is a private company there are no public shareholders
she even have a unique animation when you enter the game first time after the update even the previous anniversary main dps acheron dont have such treatment the devs def want to go all in for the revenues from this banner topup resetspending events
someone already bought copies of her we are so cooked
natlbg the anniversary is shit without the ads a story quest two events an anniversary event thats time gated
neokatwastaken no really hoyo is own by tencent
it depends on the conversion rate some people buy the currency but dont spend it on the banner they spend at conversion rate will be low hyv not a new company they should be able to track that
dilucsf its already at mil
i played since day ill just quit if they continue
im glad is the case she is awesome and patch ha sbeing relly good
hoyo is a private company
i think you meant to say over million
damn you were right hsr made over m from ios android alone
please dont spend spending money to pull for meta is a rabbit hole and if you fall in it you wont be able to get out until its taking too much of a toll in your pouch some pitiful souls dont ever get out of it if you feel like spending to support a game you like and feel is worth it its your decision but spending responsably should come first and never because the game its leading you there with powercreep as thats a sign of a negative game
oscargutierrez not saying id whale or spend money only time ill ever do that is if i really like a certain character or characters then i would es them besides i already have a list on who i want to pull anyway
i thought that e archeron was enough because even though there is powercreep in the game i didnt think its gonna be this fast at least let my e archeron last for another year or
jaya well thats fine please dont take it as me telling you how to spend your money i just wanted to prevent someone to naively begin spending in gacha meta
oscargutierrez yeah i know that money should be spent wisely
never top up those are words i live by in gachas the pass is pretty innocuous and high value so i normally go for that but even that is in question now with the extreme greed on display seriously considering going fp when my current pass runs out and if the game becomes too hard or unfun for fp in the future it might be time to move on
same i take months off usually works out when the guys banners are up turned off reddityoutube leaks and news working on learning german and working out things i dont need a roulette wheel foror the classic steam backlog good luck
fucking same literally just the dragon if it wasnt for the dragon castorice couldve been an easy skip for me such a missed opportunity of a potentially interesting thematic of character as a whole
for global passives as a concept or for just this one in particular
grimsdol as a concept to me if i dont like a characters designlorewhatever i wont get them i didnt get tribbie for example even when i knew i was gonna get castorice ppl are too focused on endgame in a single player game and if you just get the chars u want and have fun playing the storywhatever
blehbeh well theyre focused on the endgame cuz thats all the content outside of story and ig exploring but thats meh and its where we get a good chunk of jades from so it still is an important part of the game
ofc i understand but its not realistic to think that ur gonna clear the hardest content in a pw game every patch otherwise why would whales spend money so why even focus on that to begin with just clear the content build ur chars and play an event or then swap games gacha games arent made to be played like a normal game anyway
blehbeh it is and it should be theres a reason why gacha games rightfully get called trash and its because of things like that reason why genshin was such a massive success was because it made sure that never happens it doesnt matter how good your graphics or gameplay is if people constantly feel the need to use the hot new thing in order to enjoy parts of the game and if hoyo wanted players to spend more then they should improve their character is more either through stroy fun or marketing people dont whale in these games because of meta reasons its purely because they like the character that much
no thats not true ive known many people that did not care for characters and only pulled for meta to build the strongest team so to say and u say that it should be but it isnt there is patches that bring new content u play the patch and then quit or you login every day until the next content drops thats gacha games at its core if you want a game that u can play thats not gacha games and people need to understand that hoyo also doesnt care that much because people keep buying their characters no matter what anyway look at pokemon for example they have huge numbers even though the games are laggybad graphics hoyo is in the same boat because there isnt a lot of competition this has gotten better ofc bcs of wuwa etc but not perfect yet
blehbeh people who care about the meta are in the minority and people who pull purely based off of meta are an even smaller minority the only time the wider community cares about meta is when it becomes a problem that effects their gameplay experience like powercreep or a character being too powerful otherwise they just pull for the characters they like and those players should still be able to enjoy the entire game without having to be meta slave and adding things like global passives makes that harder and harder to do each time a new passive gets added
grimsdol no u are again thinking a gacha game is like a normal game its not and ppl need to stop fooling themselves bcs of it gacha games will be harder to beat esp end game contentmodes if you do not pull for objectivly good characters thats why there is challenge accounts to begin with star only fp only etc im not saying global passives are good im saying they simply do not affect me and probably a majority of the fanbase that doesnt even cleartouch moc for example and that at the end of the day we should just pull for the chars we want bcs they make us play the game and if we cant clear content the highest tiers of end game content bcs of that then thats fine with me whales will have incentive to pull and look cool and the game will keep going steadily
blehbeh why not think a gacha game especially a hoyo game is like other games people who actively try not to have things be compared to each other are people being disingenuous hsr and gacha games as whole are still games and they should be fun and fair making it so you need you cant use the characters you want and instead have to use your precious money or pulls on the best characters whether you like them or not isnt fun and if your answer is thats how gacha games are then guess what those games are trash theyre not good games the reason why genshin and hoyoverse as whole was such a massive success is because it made sure not to fall into the same pitfalls as other gachas
grimsdol sure you are right to a certain extent however at the end of the day hoyo games are still gacha games and no matter how fair they still use the same practices denying that and saying they are still games they should be fun and fair is like turning a blind eye towards how gacha games function they profit off of fomo and they do anything to make you spend money this is why moc changes favorably towards newer characters and is why we have different meta over the span of years esp with star rail you notice this with powercreep and now ofc global cooldowns genshin and star rail and zz operate the same way daily login weeklies different in game quests events etc these games are not comparable to for example monster hunter world where you buy the gameexpansion and then are able to grind and complete everything within the game without having to spend more money on armorweapons which is their equivulant of chars i suppose gacha games are free and they need to earn money too free games usually have skins fortnite cod etc and gacha games have characters also sometimes skins my answer to why not a gacha games is that they are free and need to make money they earn their majority money from whales this is a known fact with gacha games and that means they will always need to give whales that powerful feeling hence the moc catering to newer characters harder content for fplow spenders its how these games work and thats why i dont even try to compete with them i just have fun with the characters i want and plan accordingly every patch i also have accounts so i am able to get the characters i want gacha games give you the illusion u can play for free by having to invest a huge amount of time because time money and time invested more incentive to spend money you should not forget that all games but especially gacha games are made to make money
blehbeh theres always an acceptable limit and its important to create one the argument that they have to make money can be used to excuse any scummy way of marketing or monetization hey why is this is this game well they gotta make money somehow
yes but that is gacha games at its core yes ofc game prices need to be realistic but gacha games specifically reward whales by having better characters when they spend money thats their whole business model and why the game is free and why they give more free pulls towards the beginning of the game its a known tactic to get you hooked thats why i keep saying gacha games are different and why when we play them we should keep that in mind
blehbeh hsr has hundreds of millions of dollars in budget and makes just as much it does not need to do this in order to keep afloat and idk any whales who arent selfish idiots who asked for global passives on star characters
they didnt ask for it but it doesnt bother them because they will always get them anyway also they earn way more than they spend thats just normal business practice that every company does again gacha games just work like this no matter the company the sooner you realize that the sooner u can start planning and have fun on ur own terms
blehbeh global passives on limited characters are not the norm in gachas and being complacent with yummy practices that dont improve the game in anyway is how games die
grimsdol they might not be the norm but that doesnt change how gachas work if anything they are trying to create more fomo for more money yes i agree its how games die and the game might lose players for that i dont think i would have introduced a global passive if i was in charge and i dont think its a good decision however it does not affect me because i am not a whale and i am not clearing all of the hardest content every patch anyway if the storyevents however start to become too hard to the point where u have to rely on new characters to clear it then i think it will have gone too far
blehbeh how is the game losing players not harmful to you if the game had less players then that means less content will be made because theres not enough players and income to sustain it even if all the players who leave are fp thats still bad as a big budget game with a low population is still bad and whales arent going to spend on a game that has less and less players and content
i think its to early to judge how powerful the become in the future this one was for testing the waters with players how they react to it and how good she will sell the next global passive that comes is pretty much the make or break part ive it staiys at this smaller power scale then will its still shit you dont brick your account ive you dont pull that charakter but ive they decide to put stats or action advance on it then it becommes an even bigger problem
thing is the divine keys change the characters playstyles not affect the whole account like a global passive
yeah she not only steals ffs role in but also snags all of ffs fp team with free ruan mei being her nd best harmony behind tribbie
insane how in a build guide i found of castorice that the free and semi free remembrance light are not her second best option its any other star lightcone that has high base hp thats her second best
only bp lc works on her i straight up have bailus lc for the hp
that seems like a plus side because itll make her way more accessible for fp players unlike aglaea who required a lot of investment to perform at her peak
i was prepared to use that if i didnt get her sig as well despite this i still cannot star floor because my only competitive teams are break and cas which are held together with paperclips at this point
yes she shares supports thats been done forever back in everyone wanted ruan mei
tfemrobin exactly
whats wrong with rewarding the people that actively fund the game
tfemrobin its not wrong but the way its done seems kinda i mean i the retroactive pull reward thing is alright but the reward giveaway for spending money is a pretty twisted way of rewarding spenders for me at least
tfemrobin its not a celebration for the players then no way youre defending this greedy ass shit when its an anniversary for the players that keep the game running
tfemrobin reward
tfemrobin because those people literally fund game decisions that could screw everyone else over especially fp yeah the group of people yall never consider
tfemrobin you have major brainrot please speak with people outside of the gatcha bubble
heavily disagree a global passive granting any sort of combat advantage is several times more staggering than the slight off chance that castorices revive granting your aglaea one extra turn earning you a clear while gps are bad for sure castorices gp in specific is not strong at all like even a crit damage global passive is way worse than what castorice has
everyone complaining me who pulled castorice homer hiding in the bushe
meow
they could make it so that you can only have one global pasive at a time that way they can release a free character with one it wouldnt solve the issue completely but it would be better
are we seriously still on about this heres a stunt im going to not watch the video and see if i can still nail the content let me know how i did part castorice and her global passive are briefly introduced part an explanation of what a global passive is part the potential pitfalls of global passives long term part agonized handwringing over whether or not we trust hoyo to not monetize a mechanic spoiler alert we dont part the rather odd assertion that the players who arent quitting right now are too stupid to understand any of the above points part defensive dismissal of possible counterarguments part the disingenuous argument that any nice thing introduced to hsr from now on is part of a cynical effort to distract the fans rather than address the underlying issues part connect to the wider power creep issue avoid at all costs explaining how these issues arent baked into the gacha format part wrap up by asking for engagement in the comments ive been seeing this video in some form or another for months and they all every last one of them follow this pattern
doesnt the passive require a sustain i know castorice can heal in some way but not that quickly so even if she has that passive you still need a healer or a shielder to not lose that second life
whoever idea that is they should be fired immediately
global passives better be locked to major releases if they want the game to still be at least fp friendly atp castorice is acheron v and i definitely dont want to get her in terms of a gameplay perspective the real issue here is that instead of skipping out of damage acheron youre skipping out on a passive that extends outside of a character basically its an account buff facepurplecrying
on top of the entire controversy and major power scaling issue just like mauvika i want to play the character not a bike or a dragon i dont understand their design focus and thank goodness she doesnt appeal to me so its an easy skip whereas i understand how so many are tempted by the supposed meta with how they are continuing its killed any interest in continuing to invest as its proven it makes dedication pointless or quickly overcome basically in a few patches hope theyll redirect and correct before they continue going down this path too long
free to play dying
not hoyo shoving a unique castorice animation at the login screen yikes
they already brainwashed the players by giving a free star and pulls whats stopping them from adding more global passives the hsr player base aint doing shit not to mention when tf are we getting a star
himeko the next stop is powercreep
this is hilarious i actually started day then quit shortly after pulling and building huohuo i just got fed up and extremely bored with how limited this turn based game is instead of making this account wide buff a free unlock through story and in the future potentially adding more account wide unlocks which add more depth to your favourite two button autoplay masher they put it into a limited characters kit chefs kiss
wuwa dying video when
i would agree that chars power did spike alot but most of them are restricted aswell like herta and archeron needing certain chars to function well the same kinda with castorice might need more than one healing unit older dps like blade yunli etc arent that restriced i dont really understand the fuss about her passive though while its funny that that powerceps bailus completly its for most content not that usefull anyway i do think this will be special for her aswell since shes kinda death incarnet i really dont think were gonna see that often and when it wont be direct damage or stat boosts
castorices global passive i can revive you some players brother ew
as a guardian tales enjoyer castorices global passive is a joke compared to global stats buff pvp gacha btw
how bad global passive is entirely dependent on how much faith you have in hoyo balancing global passives if all passives are practically pointless and have a set limit then the game will live but if youre like me you have no faith in hoyo and fully expect them to powercreep global passives and make them a must have or struggle and have linit on how many can be active
all amphoreus characters have basically been s tier so far i have doubt that the next characters are gonna be the same powercreep rail is real
this it would reduce the fomo and will have people consider if one passive is better for a team over another rather than new global passive will buff my characters need to pull
or none
or have it only active while fighting in amphoreusduring the amphoreus act as like a thing for the story idk
and you know damn well they would never do that
no just make the global passives freely farmable the problem arent the passives but that theyre completely locked behind limited units this wouldnt be a problem if powercreep wasnt as blatantly bad as this newer enemies are always balanced around newer units what makes you think they wont be balanced around requiring global passives also
that doesnt solve anything maybe just dont release characters with global a passive in the first place
commenter above doesnt read op properly
im gonna reply this comment because of seth thank you fellow silver knight
yeah surely hoyo will do that thats just copium honestly
honestly just remove the global aspect of the revive and make it so that she can prevent a fatal attack once per battle in her current team its that simple
johnarcenas chinese law can allow that so yeah cooked
justamoogle they cant backtrack they cant just nerf castorice and because they will do more in the future at least limit them to one por team
legatusfall best knight in fe my homies hate orson
thats exactly what im saying it would still keep the economic gambling perception as always and not break the games meta people dont have to pull all the characters they can just save for a passive they want to have and even so i dont think this passive is going to be a consistent thing jsut something every once in a while like anniversaries
nicholasrodriguez no i think the game having new mechanics is good increases diversity of gameplay and generates more revenue for characters cause at the end of the day they are still a billion dollar company and compnies want money
zennir new mechanics revive is new mechanics on hsr or its the global passive you are talking about if yes then that not a very good one one mechanics they can do that is not as bad as being global passive is just make it team wide passiveno activation required just meeting certain requirements an example would be similar to march hunt has but team wide not just for herself hp increase for the team the unity with that passive and not something that will take effect just from having them even in team the unit is not part of
zennir ive been telling people that this global passive is a special thing that literally only reserved for a special anniversary characters like last year we got acheron that has a technique that is still the only one that is able to kill mobs instantly castorices revive isnt really that good either man these small percentage of the total population quite literally freaked out because of all of these what ifs lmao i dabbled in leaks still to this day theres no datamined information about gp other than castorices
they definitely gonna do that
or maybe they should change the global passive into a party passive and have it so her passive activates if she is in the current team
seth complaining about game balance has to be one of the most ironic takes
this
you should shield or heal the semidead person if you fail to do that they die for reals
you did not get the point of the video
you completely ignored everything vars said
look at this shit
i agree i got fully convinced to skip her after doing her trial i prefer to play and see my character and not the summon when in combat especially in this game where theres not much to do in the overworld
lulu jpg its fine everyone has their own fun respect each other
lulujpg castorice still fights normally in battle even when she summons her dragon wtf are yall on about
thejh you see and use the dragon way more in battle than castorice herself thats their point
its funny how im actually completely opposite im a guy that always pick summoner class for most games so when i saw a dragon i just had to save for her on my second acc lol though im basically done with spending money anyway except for battlepass here and there when i feel like it really just depends on how they handle character buffs and story telling from now on
edandeyo yup
okay this is just straight up opinion based like other people have more fun with summoners than playing the characters im neither of them and it only depends on how fun playing the summon is
istaroth update i pulled her and her lc haha
lulujpg lol me too i couldnt resist since i just love pink haired characters sad that she will forever be hated by some people because the devs decided to be greedy
they did it first in zz with miyabi but no one talked about it because
my game froze during that scene and booted me out of it lmao its like it was protecting me from poor marketing choices
phoebebonkstick mostly cause miyabi was built up since the games beta and doesnt fundamentally change how the game works even if she is very atypical
naah bro it tried to do it again and it froze too
the moment i saw this i was like they dont even try to hide it anymore
phoebebonkstick perhaps because miyabi wasnt that much of an issue like the biggest problem ive heard was her giving powercreep and how big it was i guess
oh my lord its an animation to promote the banner character lots of gacha games do this youll live
with a button to take you directly to summon her
that wasnt even a problem for me since i found that normal the fact they have the shopping cart shown at the top of gui is worse
rain yes but do they need to send me to the banner whats the point they could have made the animation play when you click on the banner icon
go to shop
phoebebonkstick probably because zz is doing very badly at least for a hoyo game and was a desperate effort save the game from steady decline by implementing all the feedback people already gave them a thousand times over since the first open beta thats the point when companies do this its because of desperation something is going very wrong at hoyoverse
ok so what about the other page of hoyo trying to make me buy something before i even get to the game rain
phoebebonkstick miyabis a void hunter meanwhile cas isnt even an emanator yet given such special treatment
otherface retroactively she hasnt power crept the game dps released after her are following the standard power level and she is being made to be an outlier not setting a new norm
strobo lore accurate castorice killing stuff
fp needs to silence man
dragonkingtaidus didnt she bring a new type
phoebebonkstick because youll anger the miyabi fanboys hoyo themselves with their golden child powercreeper that appears in every version even when it has nothing to do with her rip rina and belobog heavy industries will get a skin wit alternate effects got a whole new element and still dominates the meta even after eve and sanby
xenosaber yup heres the miyabi fanboys
theres no fucking way people are complaining about a little animation in a game thats literally supposed to sell its characters
uhhneri oh im sorry i didnt expect to speak to a child move along then
dia_d_auth yup people complaining about nothingburgers even anby isnt interested
xenosaber sure thing although the projection is insane
uhhneri yeah i agree hope you grow up into someone respectable lil bro
why not putting it when you pull her yikes instead putting it login
have you celebrated your castoversarry yet its a holy anniversary to pull for castorice have you the watched the special entrance animation have you clicked warp now button have you topped up yet have you used the super duper deals to top up have you watched our total of minutes anime episode about her she has a global passive too you know right how about flashy bp rewards with her icon have you talked to her on phone have you spent money yet have you seen the super model pose she hits in the launcher anaxa is the guy in the background but we havent figured out who he is yet better pull for castorice and we have added a nd logo to celebrate our nd anniversary by the way that was all the budget we had left after giving castorice special petal animations at the last moment happy holy castorice day
dannympdq the castoversarry is real all hail butterfly pou
shutup hoshimi miyabi
it was annoying
plazumah it takes about two seconds to press go to banner and two more seconds to press the esc key and exit do you all ever tired of whining about non issues
it was actually awesome it ran very smooth on both my pc and phone yeah my phone is s ultra hence it ran smooth
i mean its weird that its a unique animation but its not really that surprising that they shove new characters in your face when you login they obviously want you to pull instead of unique animations they shouldve just showed her animations in game to make people want to pull her and make it so all new units have this going forward but also allow everyone to skip it if you dont know this is exactly what epic seven a turn based game like hsr does for every new character
phoebebonkstick yeah this also clearly showed that if no one talks about it they will do it again
stealthless_ a unique animation with a button that says go pull now
phoebebonkstick did they i dont remember that at all
and i still ignored it they were legit trying to make me pull nah im good
flashkillerx theres an x button its not forcing you to go to the banner screen
flashkillerx a unique animation with x button on top of the screen
there are many issues in the game and you guys chose an intro animation that takes seconds to exit
rain unfortunate i didnt live fuck global pasive
thiccychiccy it created a bad president it created a bad president it created a bad president how many times do we have to repeat this old man
kangelparfait every problem is a problem
phoebebonkstick we just didnt care that much bro even though we were aware it wasnt as deep as castorice
immediately turned me off from pulling her maybe ill reconsider on her rerun but gosh theyre pushing her hard
_lynxninja_ i know theres an x button but its small and the color almost blends in and the go to warp button had a big eye catching animation it just reads as desperate to me
flashkillerx you want the x button to be bigger also desperate lol the only people quitting are sweaty players which arent a lot
i didnt get it though
whats wrong with that i liked it i would like to see it for every new character when their banner starts
i like the character so it was cool for me but i get what are yall saying
strobo its telling you to buy a better pc rather than spending it on gacha games bro
phoebebonkstick miyabi is a void hunter thats a big deal in zz also zenless doesnt have any powercreep since you can clear endgame content with only a rank agents even the herta whos a literal emanator never got this kind of treatment and shes like a big deal in game in terms of title and power
ok crybaby its marketing
zek who says im spending a dime lmao if i had money to waste on gacha id have upgraded my pc a long time ago
with the only option to exit it being going to the wish menu i think
otherface isnt m miyabi better than m ellen who only came out like patches earlier
ikr they want us to want her bad
is this supposed to be a big deal literally every gacha makes the jump towards making marketing of this sort after a while even dokkans year old self went this route after about years
phoebebonkstick thats not even the same thing
rain that doesnt make it right what a dumb argument
otherface she was stronger then ellen e by x she was litterally stronger in term of dmg than a ellen you call that you fuking zz shill
what force you to roll miyabi nothing if you want to do it do it if not stfu
its normal for this kinda game tbh
and theres an x button on the topright corner that blends in so well with her dragon faceorangefrowning
phoebebonkstick yea we got a free character in that version i wonder why people was not angry
and when you try to speak up about the whole fandom thinks youre a meta slave and that its not a big deal most of these players are casuals who dont know any better
i believe our next star is mr reca in whichbasically were going a whole entire version without a single star
filmaphobic lets keep it that way not everyone should be crying and seething
there is only one thing ill give to hoyo shills and its that this specific passive is pretty bad but that is also a problem the fact that it is a crutch passive that only activates if you do poorly is why its easy to dismiss any legitimate problems people might have with passives as a whole i predict that couple patches from now community will be crying about dogshit state of balance that no one can explain how it even came to being all the while every other unit will be giving some unique passive that all end game content requires you to have to beat it but then again some people are still denying that powercreep exist so maybe itll be more than few patches from now
yeah cause we dont care about global passive or whatever even if they add more i highly doubt they would center the difficulty of endgame content around the assumption that you have alot of them theyre not stupid
filmaphobic dont know any better really more like not taking a game too seriously you aint dying from a game of being greedy
apparently you cant enjoy hsr anymore without being brainwashed
grayewicked i mean theyre doing that right now what not to say
hsr and goonering waves are the worst right now not a single star for months
blueraine because stars simply just dont sell
_lynxninja_ the players who dont understand why such things added is bad for the game will influence the game in the future to add more greedy things and the play base wont bat an eye bc they think its ok
xenosaber omfg get out if you dont give a shit
extra irony they had a dorm system and a farmable divine key system in honkai impact rd which served as damage bonuses sp recovery and so on too bad they made it further greedy by needing to chase older s rank gacha units to double s or get two divine keys of the same category to get level two versions of stronger damage and sp recovery which made small enough differences to reach minor thresholds for loops and so on which further got worst when signature gear in honkai rd often would give one or more instance of massive bonus sp and sometimes switch cooldown reduction to make them skip one or more rotations out of time sinking heavy crap if you remember the flamechaserss eden character in hird and pardofelis then you know why that crap was beyond broken
it isnt even that strong of a global passive it revives them with hp and they need to be healed even if they are shielded or theyll die well if you are running a preservation comp her passive is already useless because you have no healers sometimes you will die resurrect into hp and it happens instantly so the enemy just smacks you dead again its not really op enough to change meta
escapetherace thats beside the point its the door opening to more global passives in the future
escapetherace and apparently people ignoring the boogers on the wall again even if they were to die immediately after thar next turn from being revived from it thats essentially bloodzerg gimmick where they do one last grenade charge to do an impact which is fantastic for some tactics to cheese out one more last valueage being able to use it to straight up ignore a oneshot mechanic that has such an absurdly high ceiling to clear can enable people to just let the death happen revive after it pop an ultimate or some special reaction effect and they effectively got a free get out of jail free card to ignore a mechanic and now have rotations to obliterate the boss instead of when that mechanic shows up the first time they introduced an entire ui for it they are gonna straight up add way more of these global passives and like priarms in hird did and fatui harbingers were like in genshite they will make it the most cancerous thing ever which ps they are totally not gonna put a limit on how many you have out because then that would limit how much fomo they can cram into players to spend on as many global passive units ultimately though it sets up multiple factors between exploitation of a gimmick flip off newer players who were not around when this character was available and suffer and praying for them to return but its always put on another super awesome chars banner because hoyoverse reruns suck in general and of course now hoyoverse is gonna ramp up the power escalation even harder by having the justification of people can now have access to a bailu endure that also flips off preservation shieldstacking nuts by demanding a heal to make it fully like a baihu revive except it can apply to more then just a single person basically and just a reminder they dont even need the global passives to be on good units in particular they could straight up make some of the character buffs make characters like silverwolf kafka or blade also have global passives to further the bs on newer players who now have to chase super old dated characters regardless of how much they been buffed and will make it even harder to deal with chasing new chars vs chasing reruns because of global passive editions which you can imagine them purposely releasing hook level of trash characters that just get some super special global passive like a permanent weakness dmg bonus or a shield at the start of combat or increase to healing value would sound so small but then it can not only stack up but maybe even synergize into extra bs hell imagine the introduction of a global passive that gives hp regen or life steal to the entire party that would straight up be some bs hoyoverse would shove out and conviently fix the problem of cast of rices global passive thus demanding people have to pull on limited characters for a broken sell you the problem charge extra for a solution months later level of bs
they just hotfix censor cantarella and fleurdelys so now
like many people have said her revive isnt the issue the addition of global passives in general is with the way hsr handles difficulty aka hp inflation and hyperspecific gimmicks designed to make you wanna pull whatever shiny new units theyve just released global passives just add another avenue for them to make combat more playerhostile than playerfriendly down the line we might get for example a character that turns all excess crit rate into crit dmg for every character in your account sounds neat right only sucks for people who dont want that unit in particular but then that same update they release a boss who only takes damage if your character crits essentially making that character as close to mandatory as possible for whatever endgame content that boss appears in unless youre masochistic enough to play the losing game known as relic minmaxing
the dps might be restricted but theyre def one upping one another therta in a star team does almost more damage than acheron with jiaoqiu its not normal please lets be worried about the game now before its too late dont make the mistake the genshin community did
dg_toti you say that and they just showed that is what they will do with the netherwing fight causing all your units go down to and bypast shields meaning its a boss that literally pushes castorices passive to activate
dg_toti please you might as well not make up any extra examples like that crit one by yourself repeating the words made up by ccs should be enough
typhus_the_fallen hm thats a bit arbitrary the hp mechanic of the boss however is more significant in weight compared to the global revive mechanic
dg_toti i dont know like i said it would surprise me when global passives become alot more and would impact stats directly also to the bossfights i dont know any boss where you absolutely need to use the obvious mechanic like sams or deaths or sundays bossfight the closest might be the adventurin fight
axilfodilighouba what did happen in genshin felt most chars in natlan were mid and hyperbloom is still my go to
castorice needs a sustain like any other unit thats literally not even a restriction lmao she just doesnt make use of preservation and we preservation units so its not a big deal herta with star erudition is stronger than most full five star teams in the game mydei is one of the strongest units in the game and he has auto aglaea wants sunday thats her restriction just like feixiao with robin ffrappa with ruan meifugue castorice is literally doing sustainless team numbers with a sustain along with team wide all type res pen unkillable aoe no skill point consumption insane single target damage because she has bounce she ults sixty times a cycle theres no restriction on her character in fact her being able to benefit that well from a sustain literally is what makes her so good because a lot of teams dont really have much as much benefit from them compared to units like castorice in the first place she should be doing way less damage for the cost of being able to charge her ult off a sustain but she just puts out sustainless team damage numbers while being fully safe immortal and overpowered with no cost or downside besides lack of lightcone options even then shes still extremely strong and shell get more lc in the future
what do you think dangerous precedent means
i left guardian tales a long time ago something tells me im doing the right thing for not coming back still hsr nor the gacha industry should evolve into that
guardian tales is peak as a casual player
my fellow dumbface knight
i have spent around dollars total since guardian tales came out and i have every single passive there is to get xd you cant compare this to gt you can compete with whales in gt with enough time and investment
mrdata also no character is really limited time only in gt except for collab units and equipment and those dont have stat bonuses in collection or knowledge
honestly they arent really comparable because no one really plays pvp except team death match where collection bonuses are all enabled by default for everyone but whales anyways most of the playerbase just cares about the story and coop and real competition occures mostly in raid also it came with the game since day unlike hsr adding it way down the line
doing anything but understand the point
isnt that the same with most and characters at their release lol
animeshortscontent you have never played a gacha before genshin tell me im wrong and i will call you a liar this is not the norm in gacha games nor was it the norm in hsr at the beginning
gacha history battle cats genshin wuwa then star rail
satyr this is the norm in hsr every star character released in hsr have been top tier for endgame modes because they have stage buffs that heavily shill towards the newest star
multidragonreaper it wasnt the case up until acherons release up to then everything was still somewhat balanced yes jingliu was insanely strong but the gap between her and dhil was not that massive sparkle is technically a better buffer but has some pros and cons compared to bronya who is her direct competition black swan was the star version of sampo that dot was waiting for but she wasnt broken and then acheron got released and completely destroyed any semblance of balance in terms of dps output then we got aventurine who trivialised enemy dmg output if you had him because he just refuses to die unless you used him against dotfocused enemies firefly feixiao rappa all three of them completely destroyed the damage floor and partially ceiling of what their path was expected to perform as boothill too in a way but hes a mechnically much more complicated character to use correctly so far in version all the limited dpses seem to perform roughly at the same dps output level one being a bit better than the others depending on the specific environment or situation meaning youre not gonna lose out if you dont have all or multiple of them so far
satyr the characters next patch are supposedly kinda mid tho hyacine is basically lingsha but a bit worse in general but is pretty much a specialized healer for castorice cipher is counterintuitive bc her follow up attacks want you to spam ult but her ult generation can be slow bc its made so that it can get a lot of stacks to increase the dmg so its this to do this to do that but it does this cipher doesnt even replace topaz and numby in fua teams nor does she find a place in acheron teams especially post e acheron hoyoverse has obv held back so much in making the next characters op im not excusing their terrible choices but tribbie was also made so that the hp meta has a support attack carries will nearly always prefer robin and making hp scaling dps rely on robin is terrible shes also made for self buffing characters so shes kinda mid with characters like cipher and feixiao aglaea is very hard to maximize and mydei is very good but has so many obvious issues anaxa isnt meta hes a hypercarry designed to be a support but has no buffs hes one of the worst hypercarries in the game even worse than seele hes just gonna be another therta shill the only true meta characters in so far is tribbie therta and castorice its so exaggerated how meta the new characters are even then castorices passive changes nothing in sustainless and if u die then theres already a problem with ur run her dmg is still a good ways lower than thertas and if u compare their es therta pulls ahead by so much yall overreact on this so bad
animeshortscontent exactly gachas have inevitable powercreep its all about how resistant they are and hsr is by far the least powercrept gacha ive played people who say otherwise clearly have only played hsr and no other gachas this is the most fp gacha ive seen
naotokun as someone who has played wuwa and literally genshin both are less powercrept and more fp friendly all tho not sure if genshin is neccessarily more fp friendly but wuwa is
averagernghater tbf wuwa is half as old as hsr so its not noticeable yet it took two years for hsr to have any signs of powercreep
naotokun fair enough but genshin is excluding mavuika whos from like doing pretty well with powercreep
thejh i dont think you get what i mean in my last comment all the endgame modes like to heavily favor the newest star character to make them feel like the best character in the game thats how the games baits you into thinking the newest character is a must pull example being when ruan mei released the moc buff was weakness break as much enemies as possible to do massive damage when acheron released the moc buff was every character can debuff an enemy so she can spam her ultimate faster when ratio released the moc buff was every enemy gets debuff on a new cycle and so on
satyr it was absolutely a norm at beginning of hsr the hell are you saying mate
no its no more a problem than power creep in any gotcha or a new mechanic that needs a new character sorry but the whole could be a problem is the basis of gotcha games are you new to this
i hope zz doesnt add global passive like this dogshit game
honkshit could never
but the precedent
honestly just stopped playing after castorice if the game will make more global passives like these im not interested
this here neatly explained the core problem of remerance
views in one minute vars got nerfed
minute ago is arousing
castorice is so strong i hope they dont become too predatory
hi
sponsor get up to off on gacha game httpschainldshopggtdauow safe convenient all you need is uid join ldshopgg discord for queries httpsdiscordggwdhgdsvhrs claim your vip pass here
are you right yes should we not complain no just because something maybe the norm doesnt make it immune to criticism
even if they do which i hope they wont global passives if were talking about something similar to castorice would be pretty useless because you dont need defensive boosts that much unless skill issues
honkai rail sounds better than honk in my opinion
me uninstalled star rail now playing infinity nikki good event party and black beaconnew game
unfortunately they already have if what ive heard is correct amphoreous will basically be redesigning combat entirely just to make horizontal investment the norm
bit late for that the game is more predatory now than ever although idk if im crazy or if my build is bad or what but my es castorice is honestly not that strong in combat not nearly as strong as i expected her to be i dont have tribbie so that could be it but i do have es ruan mei who ive heard is in some cases even better than es tribbie
flashkillerx im cycling moc hitting about million damage in moc k apoc shadow score million damage in pf without her lc and tribbie e you are missing out on alot of her potential unfortunately
obviously she seems like the kind of character who simply requires vertical investment to put up the kind of performance everyone perceives her as having as es with the battle pass light cone and without tribbie shes good enough to use but nothing special i personally was able to cycle moc with her but i was a singular attack in each phase off of the cycle timer so i could have gotten that down to cycles so an optimized es is capable of cycling without tribbie it seems which sounds good but one side and the whole moc buff is hand tailored to her and her kit so what happens when it isnt
too late hoyo isnt going to stop until it pushes its players as far as it possibly can
yeah u better enjoy her now while u can because patches later she will be at the corner of the wall again
but meta over fun my opinion dragon boring good luck for pulls
apdf the rotation definitely isnt boring the skill expression but yeah meta always usually ends up being fun for me coincdentally this is the most fun rotation in the game ive had since yunli
top up services are always a risky bet wouldnt recommend taking more sponsors from them in the future the only person i know that has tried using a trusted one they used a creator code with ended up getting their genshin account banned a month or so later they hadnt used mods cheats private servers or done any account sharing use at your own risk
these sites always seam so tempting for the cheaper top ups but at the same time they look so risky in so many ways
will they also give the same bonuses that the game gives when buying
jensei i actually got the double
came back here to see how the people that were saying phainon gonna have a global passive and the collab characters will for sure have global passive people were doing nowadays lmaoo
i mean you dont have to spend money to play or even to pick up the stars and what point of making the game if not for money duh
if revive was that op bailu would not be d tier its more of a problem if in the future they continue to release stronger and stronger global passives
its just another turn one turn
i lost my castorice after someone hacked me hoyo didnt wanna believe it was my account
step quit step return when they announce eos step get whatever recent broken unit step clear all content with ease
what game is this
with aventurine i will never see castorice passive
i still dont see how this is pay to win as this logic would apply to any character released because of the power creep if it was tied to a constellation yeah pay to win ince its not then its no different
i can see both arguments and would agree with both arguments
wait why does her lore have to anything to do with her being broken and pay to win xd weird defense of a character being pay to win
its not the passive its the precedent the next three characters after castorice have no such thing as a global passive i expect global passives to be an anniversary character thing
op ability boss turn boss uses weak single target attack boss uses extremely strong aoe or single target attack teammate gets killed and revived boss uses weak aoe attack teammate is dead again yes sounds definitely op
if your characters are dieing at all its just a skill issue i think the more concerning matter is the hp inflation and the increased toughness un the end game content rather than a free revive
i mean shes special bcs shes an anniversary characters people just mad bcs they were getting bronya instead of castorice lol stay mad
its better then having no castorice at all idk why therr mad that they cant use k or k jade to get her
her passive wont even work unless u have a healer or if u die dying in hsr is practically impossible
in the other game venti is the anemo archon and he can terraform mountaine lorewise but got nerfed and now a homeless inazuman is better to obtain
revive per fight and at hp that isnt really much
wait you died during fight
i think global passives are gonna be an anniversary character thing one global passive per year is pretty good id say mitigates a bit of the still very present power creep
it makes me laugh how people complain about thismaybe they didnt hear or see the part where it says that a hp revives them so you have to be really lucky not to be attacked by air or the character just revived
bro its a single player game its not that deep bro
pay to win its a gacha its either be consistent and patient or not be poor like damn kids these days besides not like the passive is worth jack lol the fact your units got exploded once meant your team was too weak to begin with whats the revive gonna do power of friendship lol again just dont play it damn i have castorice and my underperforming the herta team is better than her given my teams dont really drop against bosses so the passive is as useful as your brains i didnt even know she had the passive til i saw it on youtube lol
honestly the passive usually is wasted on a less important char for me i know thats less so late game but the char dies anyway that turn anyway but honestly if they restrict it to global passive allowed at once im happy cause i dont want you to need like chars for all global boosts
i have never used her passive during moc
i have her so i support this lol
how is it pw im new and stars dont seem hard to get
also mooncocoon makes it so that it simply delays downing as if they do not gain a shield or are healed by their next turn they immediately get downed in this new update
i think this is stupid i beat the hardest version of nikador with a complete fp star team just cuz and it still was easy they werent even fully built soo skill issu
as a wuwa player shorekeeper makes your team immortal someone dies and she revives them with full hp and only losing of her own hp if you have cantarella you can heal shorekeeper in like seconds so yeah its more insane
w u need to have castorice for this
i got a solution save up your pulls and pull for her on her first rerun in like six months people bitch about her passive but they dont realize that all they need to do is pull for the damn character i pulled for her because she looked super beautiful and i didnt even care for passive but its just an added bonus
lore accurate then acheron should have a one too like at least the ability to bypass that light post enemies shield when at least using her ultimate
well since honkai have different combat which i think its not interesting and its boring i think she is good help to finish fight faster
why is this bad
suggestion make the global passive only active in amphoreus but keep the passive on in other places if shes on the team
no really pat to win in a gatcha game
so thats why my team just got revived even if i didnt have her on my team lmao
if you dead while play auto in hsr mean your gears is shit and not ready yet to play auto
it this reason why people bombarded star reviews at playstore petty behavior i was so confused
why should someone have to pull a character the entire idea behind global passives is dumb when they could have just made it a trait
why should it be free for everyone how do you expect the developers to make money if its just free
zhenyascheu where did you get free from my point is someone shouldnt need a to pull for a specific character and the whole mechanic of a global passive is pointless when you have traits
well if you dont pull for her you dont get the passive its pretty simple i dont get how hard it is for people to understand that you have to have the character for it to work and you think theyre just gonna give it out as a trait its all about making money and at the end of the day if they give you another reason why you want to pull a character or pay for a character theyre going to do that because thats how developers work with most of todays games try to make pw as possible nobody needs to pull her its just that if you dont have her you cant use the passive pretty simple lets say she didnt have the global passive so if thats the case how much do you think people are going to pay for her
and just to let you know i didnt even know she had a global passive i just pulled for because i saved up my wishes and i find her quite cutebeautiful girls with pink hair tend to be quite cute except for march th shes annoying in my opinion
zhenyascheu i feel like your missing the point castorice isnt the problem its the concept of global passives that have people up in arms if she didnt have global passives i pretty sure the same people would still pull for her more actually if you include the people who skipped her because of the passive theres a reason why global passives are practically unheard of in gacha games
i got castorice on one account but not the other and ive never spent any real money on the game
the problem is less that it isnt cool or that the character lore doesnt support it its that it sets a precedent that its okay to do that i guarantee this wont be unique to castorice in a few months
it also revives not only one but all the team members that die in one and the same turn i pulled her on accident i didnt even know what her powers are but i was like omg she has a giant dragon ima try her out tho i still lost many battles even though her revive mechanic exists i also didnt even know how to use the dragons power correctly until i played her tutorial still you dont need to have meta characters to enjoy the game just play however you want
doesnt matter what happens players gonna cry about it free to play company allows people who spend money be in a slightly better position than people who dont spend money what a terrible greedy corporation if you dont like it how about dont play it or you like to whine
so its just gerards ability but instead of just being applied to only one person its applys to your team
its litteraly bailu but off team i mean the passive i dont see a problem plus her passive isnt really that good in my opinion
well ive got no problem with it but heres the good part i won my and got here light cone early on my main fp account
got pity castorice
lol i got her for free
yeah that passive cab save you but most of the time the all will die again
jelous i got her and i like her passive stop cryng
only one hp whats stopping your characters from getting oneshot again
i think if they do the next pasives not that strong there will be any problem i think the comunity has more fear at what could cone tomorrow than castorice pasive it self
tbh her global passive hasnt helped me at all yet in some cases i rezzed and died instantly cuz enemies got their turn during the rez lol
i got her because i love her character and i can say the passive its not as broken as it seems but im not a hardcore player so what i know but yeah now there is a possibility that in the future the powercreep will be even worse than in genshin they are not going to nerf this mechanic so the only solution i see is to give older characters a global too silver wolf jingliu fu xuan loucha kafka black swan there are a lot of them who lore wise should have insane abilities but are left behind of course nothing wild and not to everyone but thats difficult to balance
people will always find something to complain about whether its character designs character kits synergy etc i just pull whoever im interested in and play around with different teams until something clicks if characters are built well then they generally wont die unless youre fighting something thatll hit multiple times in a row before you can move and even then you can toss in bailu and get a res that way its definitely a huge thing to have but if youre dying to stuff then a time revive that leaves you on hp wont be gamebreaking
castorice literally wants to save lives its so perfect to her
blade let me die
its called a skill issue this doesnt make or break whether your team gets spanked in end game or even just normal content
lore accurate make her kill anyone in one hit then that would be lore accurate as well
i commented this before watching the the full thing so i didnt know about the part where it works even if she aint on the team im to lazy to edit it
surprised the american government isnt on their tails like they were for genshin
its just one hp it wont make a difference if the enemy is still in its turn i swear people cry about everything just pull for her if u think its that big of a utility
as non hsr player i could say the one what made her op is her unstoppable beauty
i mean people cleared all the content before without her im sure they can do it again and some bosses like sunday were damn near impossible for free to play players that didnt have copies of specific characters and their lightcones that felt pretty pay to win too but they fixed it
yall cant enjoy anything can you
ngl i didnt ment to get her i wanted blade
her passive is not really a big deal to be honest and definetly doesnt force people to get her you get a sort of revive time which is only an issue if your not building your chars well enough to do dmg and survive the idea of global passives in the game isnt good but its definetly not a broken passive like this video portrays it
seen as making the game pay to win bro its a gatcha game
wait the fuck up that shit activates regardless of everything ive been taking a longish break so i can finish all of the new planet after whatshisface fails to become a god and i only came back for dailiesweeklies so i could get castorice and now youre telling me i get a free revive once per battle mfw my account is ruined by difficulty curving skills
that anyone is still defending hsr is crazy to me its likebro what are you on its global buff and you cannot seriously expect this type a shyt to stop with castorice lol remember the hsr is better than genshin guys lmao
greedy and stupid
someone might think it okay it alrightthis game is a story game no one point a gun at your head to end moc if u think like thisyou are an idiot this game isnt focus on only story but also the endgame mode and the fact that the character later on will definitely have global passive will make it so the worth of my farming time and e i do and got in the past go to wasted
gacha gamepeople complaining about paywinwhat
i got her on my first ten pull and shes broken people just wanna complain you dont have to get her play the game as is simple
is it good yes do u need it for endgame no is it broken in the pvp battles yes oh hold on there is no pvp so i dont care what other players say d
rezero reference end me
this controversy is so old
its not her passive as such but its the implication of more global passives
poor people seething
im okay with this
well its anniversary characterlast anniversary character is also very good and her passive aint that good if this passive activates when single character down and still on enemies row it aint working unless your healer got ult look back to another anniversary character she can use her skill to instant kill enemy when not entering battle i dont see why people think shes overpowered good dmg nah theres more character can do that either good passive no heal you die also she requires some actually tactic cuz she consumes allys hp also she aint powerful to fight enemies with herself only theres more character after her you can still obtain other new characters
i got her in ten rolls idk what people are talking about play the game you get free rolls
bro im already struggling and this effect is clutching me if this is removed ill not be able to play endgame content also the accusations about pay to play are hilarious as i as a fp has been collecting all the limited stars i want with their light corn easily
as long as its not world wide dmg buffs or something like that i think its alr
global passive and the people disliking it are already making assumptions its understandable that this might bring a new model into the game even changing late game to punish those that didnt pull and creates fear for the future but we have to see how it is made first but seems like no people have to judge way before hand now that she is out people is still mad clearly many people arent happy about this and i mean many arent so devs could listen but then i just want to ask one question you are complaining about powercreep now so acheron wasnt powercreep lunae wasnt either aventurine who is he again well cas is also you can complain about this ok sure but i want to remind everyone that completing everything like moc as and pf arent obligatory at all they give many jades sure but like you tried to do it and reach your real limit doesnt have to be everything just what you can is it hard well what tf you expected everything in a silver plate its hoyo many gachas have this and this feature could potentially be a test from them who knows we all know hoyo dosent share info what so ever on their plans plus who the tf said you cant complain and you have to pull for cas personally i think there are still reasons to play the game whether its story the characters or even the endgame and events i think castorices gp is the most controversial thing so far at least from what i have seen i just wish people remembered why they started playing the game and if they are really sure giving up everything for one singular fckg thing im not saying they should stay im saying is it worth the drama mind blowing srry for the long ahh text
she isnt mandatory just dont suck wtf
just stop playing any game made by hoyo now i feel great
its part of her lore its a made up story change the damn lore some people man shit for brains
cry babys
ahh yes i remember the time where seele was the coolest star character ever
but bailu does the same thing she can revive you once per battle
unless your making the game got to let it go cause it is not that deep its fine it only helps those who are actually struggling with the game and is not a problem cause the game is not that hard that anyone is dying in game anyway
thats why i quit the game powercreep x
i think someone is a huge lore neerd at hoyo thought its gonna be a neat fit for this character and the suites waved it through because they knew this would sell like hotcakes and everybody is forced to get this unit and the future planned units with global passives
its just an odd choice to me it would be fine if the revive happen only if she was on the team i just hope it doesnt follow the trend of weve made the new content for the new character specifically so if you dont have them uh i hope you have perfect relics if they make content with the thought of well everyone should have castorice so they should have a revive i will be livid
so i lost my how long till her return months
if its authority of death wouldnt that means she would kill off your team then how does it align with the lore
lore accuracy as a defense makes sense none of the other characters have to be lore accurate most of them arent even in their lore accurate paths like ratio being hunt instead of erudition or jing yuan being erudition instead of hunt blade can fall in battle and is significantly weaker than his canon acheron isnt one shotting every character etc theres no reason to completely break the game balance for lore canon when that was never an expectation from players to begin with
who isnt surprised that people are complaining about it instead of having fun
i really dont understand this passive
also the precedent thing only matters if characters never came back around for rotation to pull for them you dont have to spend money at all
im just saying im fp and i got her on accident in one ten pull if anybody would suffer from not having her it would be me lol
as an hird player this is not new hoyo already did this multiple times in hird if youre a meta slave you just gotta pull for the new characters to stay at the top ranking
she is a must have chara because she is cute
if your character dies in a fightyour buildteamgear is probably not ready for the contentressing up just makes him die again
so people are mad because an op character got released i just comeback to the game so i dont take those meta seriously
for me there is no problem about this castorise character why because hsr is not a multiplayer game why do people bother about this xd
me when i lie
wow after years ppl are starting to realize that honkai star rail is a cash grab game
it is making a gatcha game pay to win lmaoo
just lore accurate thats the glaziest hoyoshill respond ive ever seen in my life
love how the majority of players were saying i am pulling for castorice before she even appeared as a character in the game and now the majority is complaining about her that hoyo made her a must pullpeople are fascinating creatures
what how is that op if it is in the middle of the enemies turns then you will die again this is such a dumb controversy
my reaction for all this
lore accurate
the game is pay to win now cause of some stupid free revive thing wow the game wasnt pay to win before this at all crazy turn of events here i was thinking ppl pay everyday in this game to win
dont care
ay cry about it get your money up not your funny up
realistically nobody actually cares nd just go oh global passive cool
they nerfed it to once per battle wich i think is fine
cry me a river
not on anyones side at all i think its a equal passive but you do know they are right its basically lore accurate
dramatic dogs like u
womp womp broke cope yall ever see a crackhead buckle and give up hell nah we love powercreep as if acheron didnt change farming its not new
its just a game at the end of the day its just code
my first and only thought is this doesnt necessarily even save that character from multiple attacks
this isnt about castorice this is about global passive in the future this shit ll continue and bosses ll be stonger after that some charecters ll be must pull
imagine getting mad about an op character in single player game what you dont have to get to complete the story
crybabys k stellar jade waiting for her
people realize they dont have to pull right like these basic bitches get that you can just not get one character if you dont like them also its not multiplayer if a person gets extra revive for a solo run who cares
just get her wtf
the real issue isnt her passive but what it opens up for hsr in the future more insane characters with absurd global passives and with how hsrs characters have been already this is not a reach
for end game player
after her powerscaling on future units will be through the roof
couldnt care less i like the idea of global passives people can keep crying about it while everyone else has fun with the game
it doesnt master this game is not competitive and its already easy without her
its kinda useless honestly if youre dying to begin with thats the real problem the l actual issue is the future globals thatll come as precedent
in my opinion its not that op like you still need to heal them and its only for people who were killed in that turn which at least to me is usually only one character also you could still be killed right after
i mean it just bailu passive but improvise to be a global passive gepard also had this passive which revive himself i dont get it why people are mad
is reviving with one hp really that broken i mean its just one hp either you have a healer or you die because you dont and its not like shes a healer righti dont really remember the showcase if she does give your hp back more than yeah shes broken
why they mad lol idc
castorice is not a must have character only reason for that is if you dont like her you can choose not to role the developer create her base on her role in the story
short sighted comment the problem does not even start there the truth is that in years youll have characters with a global passive il years all released characters will have a global passive this will increase the divide between not only fp and spender but also fp and low spending in years youll have global passives in genshin in years youll have global passives in wuwa the problem is that you people dont see it is a test to check how the community reacts to being subjected to more fomo more manipulation to extract more money its the question of whether or not you support this business practices and you dont just stop playing thats what people are doing
global passives are a good idea its just that its tied to a limited star that most people cantdont want to get because of reasons it would have been better if this was tied to story progression or if she was given out for free
all the reviewbombers were just silver wolfs dummy accounts for blade uvu
who care about her being broken you can full the game with only and clear all content omg i have a broken unit on solo game and i dont even need her
bro its so simple if you die and she revives you yknow by that point youre either bad or the team aint working how its supposed to do shes not a must twitter people need to stop clowning if they are so pissed and disapointed they should just quit and let people enjoy the game and the community
wild hunt
oh noo not more broke children crying about something they cant afford in gacha whatever will we do
dude its just giving everyone extra health what can they do lol
i support this cuz i simp
a tactic by hoyo to boost money in the gacha game the game where you give them money for anime girls they made an anime girl that you have to give them money for thats crazy youre crazy if you think a forprofit corporation would do something just for money
there are only char that will get global passivd castorice cyrene they realize they fkd up so decided to make less
how can anyone said this is unique innovation this is clearly hoyo testing the water which how much they can milk their dwindling players let me remind you that this is not a pvp game this is a single player game how can hoyoshill be this stupid to understand this
why do this when they couldve just introduced old rpg elements like leader skill so whoever is set as leader can have extra effects added this can help to buff older characters that have inherent issues which can be fixed with leader skill position but will need coverage elsewhere with alternative characters this makes layering of team build alot more better then castorice leader skill be that passive when activated as leader this ties into her life death role while selling her character altogether and simultaneously fixing older characters i swear devs always start out good then idk what the hell happened to them few years later its like they lost all common sense
not in the team now i get it why people are upset wtf hoyo
ppl are overreacting on this so hard
why would it even work when shes not on the team
honestly i dont think this is a big deal if they want to introduce a new offield mechanic then it makes sense to do so with a relevant character you dont need her to clear content people are still clearing moc with only s there will be more characters with this mechanic in the future
guess what there will be an authority critical boost damage boost or speed in the lore next patches it will make sense since its in the lore oh wait welt has the power of gravity so it should make sense if they added global passive for welt with reduce speed or increase speed but i guess not since it has low sales value lol maybe when they release a premium version of welt
i can definitely see it being one global passive at a time also the pay to win argument is stupid cause this game has always been pay to win
so what why the western fandom cant just enjoy the game without any drama
until they realize we already have a character that can revive a teammate
how many times have you died just how did you even keep dying
bailu
this global passive is kind of a nothing burger a revival wont help much if your trying to finish end game content and if your doing end game content with charactors getting downed they arnt built right in the first place asl ong as global passives dont get too crazy i dont see too much of an issue
thats not that broken
cant they change that ability into her card so that it has to be equipped by someone so that itll work
ngl i just like the character so was getting her anyway that passive is just a bonus the ones complaining are just super sweaty at a single player game which makes no sense
i really hope i can get castorice i have k jades and tickets
i dont play the game but an effect that works even without the character on the field in the party seems broken not broken in a bad way but just stupid design
its a pve game its not that serious
we just forgetting bailu exists granted she has to be alive for it to work but it does the same exact thing while actually healing
its not the fact that she can revive characters its not the fact that she can revive while downed its the fact that she can revive if you have her now thats pay to win if this goes well well allow them to run away with even more in the future unless theyll balance it by releasing a new consumable that can do the same and usable in all modes
i mean if you die in battle you wouldnt probably werent ready or did a bad call so its a you problem
my opinion we can treat the global passive as a new mechanic for example if i dont pull for firefly i cant play a team with break mechanic same goes for castorice if i dont pull for her i dont get to play the revive mechanic simple right ps i really dont have firefly and i also do not consider to pull for castorice
i still dont get this issue with global passives its not like this game has conpetitive mp
i know that it can make another global passive more op but if you are in endgame and you are yapping about time revive its shit litearly this is useless in endgame you eaither dont die or your entire team die never different
because of it the ratings of hsr is now
this game aint even pvp whats so special with this revive mechanic for your dauly gameplay
castorice glazers when someone criticised their fave character with the most valid reasons but they just defend her because she looks nice
enemy aiming same target has always been a problem dev would sell you a solution and preserve the problem rather than fixing it
as someone with mydei he solos everything so i am only getting her cause her animations are cool
always bailu doing that
people crying about pve game its hilarious
shes the most blatant gooner bait since varesa and it shows literally the self insert character of hsr the nuh uh shes the best cuz we say so ahh character
this is so fucking wrong the problem is global utility locked behind gacha these kind of content farmer is part of the reason why hsr community stays dumb i doesnt matter who it is and what it is global utility never got locked behind gacha in this type of game global utility itself is not unheard of but before hsr theyre locked behind resources that anyone can farm these are usually really really late game grind and rarely game changing meanwhile castorice gp is absurdly strong for a gp for references usually gp only give you maybe bonus to stat after long long grind unless youre dumb as rock this much info should be enough to make you realize how bad it can be if gp gacha become the norm now why do i care because as much as i hate it hoyo is basically apple of gacha game right now meaning theyre the litmus test of what kind of shitty move they can get away of before others followed suit gacha locked global passive in hsr is a small problem but if it become common in industry now its huge problem
do we not know who bailu is bro this is literally just a slightly upgraded bailu
idk how about dont do endgame content the game isnt even hard if you take it slow and imagine complain over something like this simple iif you dont want to follow the meta dont do endgame content
its lore accurate its greed greed accurate and waifu treatment
slapping effect just from obtaining character are innovation to boost revenue some upcoming character might have stronger effect and become must have character its way better to give these effect from item or something by completing story or world exploration
in my opinion i dont really think its bad and all its just that if this global passive stop just at castorice its finesince shell get a rerun anyway fp player will surely obtain her sooner or laterwhat if its not stopping at castoricewe still living in what if situation so there is a possibility that there might be more coming soon right
es hoolay still claps your entire team the revive is just prolonging the inevitable
i support this unique feature
actually nothing wrong about castorice global passvie but the way they bring global passive to us player why only castorice that have this global passive why not give anaxa global passive too from this we can predict what hoyo will do with global passive they will only give global passive to their favoured char meanwhile other char will left behind
its really not that deep guys
unlike genshin honkai actually reward us with decent rewards
yes because so many character dies in battle amirite
just stop complaining dont see u complain when u make money out of hsr content
then they should nerf the characters with global passive to not make it not too broken while also making these characters easier to obtain and also have their rerun faster i mean better pity and more rerun that should balance it maybe not what can i say that should make it easier for fp players to get it
sure lets say its for her lore but it should be triggered when shes on the team
i sure hope they let us turn it off i want castorice but global passives feel like cheating
not gonna lie i wanted to go back and to hsr for h on the new patch release just to spend all my pulls on castorice and uninstall again but seeing as how they made this i think i wont even bother doing that keep up the diarrhea mihoyo keep it up you clearly dont know any better
it fits with her kit castorices kit is unique which is why it wasnt changed and if castorice didnt have that revive all allies would be dead and it would be kore difficult to survive
did yall read the whole thing it says u need to get a shield or heal or else they die again
this passive is for castorice team and for newbie if you know how to play the game and have a character thats you build it good you dont need it
nahidloseoxwr mad doesnt have castorice lol
i skip her my dude not everyone wants castro in fact i got anaxa and his lightcone
randomsupporters not everyone has to like it and not everyone is upset they didnt get her i personally skipped her because a i dont care for her personality b i dont care for how it feels to play her and c i have seen the carnage global buffs do only reason my alt account has her is because it belongs to my sibling that doesnt play hsr and they make the pull choices they dont even know about the global passive just that she has a dragon
even without the global passive she is a musthave
moc requires you not to die which is the only mode i ever die on and even that barely happens only place i would find this useful is the max difficulty sudu which i dont care about
me i just want the waifu the ultamate dragon queen
saying its lore accurate still doesnt really make sense castorices whole ability mainly affects you if you are close to her explaining why she tells you to keep a distance so wouldnt it make more lore sense to have the passive be only when castorice is in the team where shes yknow close to you i dont really think it makes sense to have it be global as castorice wouldnt be near you if not in the team
how to enjoy hoyoverse game ignore community
only idiots think this is a good thing to be fair castorices passive itself is not broken the issue is that it now sets the standard for more passives to be added whats to stop hoyo from adding a character with a crit global passive or a speed boost
to me it helps everybody out its a free revive and thats literally it its not too broken either as you need someone to heal or shield the revived unit otherwise they just get downed again if it did something more influencial then itd be bad but its just a revive that requires extra steps
why its an issue its not a pvp games like lol or dota because hsr is a gacha games why not understand cas passv is just related to her lore
that lore accurate argument is so shallow i mean if were going with lore accuracy then most star characters should be able to clear end game content with ease because a lot of them are crazy powerful welt alone should be able to kill everybody
idc but im pussling her cuz she looks so badass and i love her color and effects
oh wait people are still dying
at the end of the day you still get to decide who to pull no one is forcing you to pull for her
i wouldnt complain about it my weak ahh dies too many times
skill issue
who care i get her cause she pretty not her boobs
both castorice and anaxa are a must pull casto because og her global passive and anaxe because of his weakness implants
i dont care about the passive but dont get me started on making lore accurate character
some will not understand why this is bad until its in characters they dont want to pull
does it really count as pay to win if your not going against other players
if this game had pvp
but the fact that hoyo is considering and even implementing global buffs is terrible and will likely set precedents for future characters
felixwang my thing is just that this is a single player game its still player choice on pulling for any character they can certainly help you play yeah but you dont need to have characters with global passives to beat enemies or just play the game
making the game pay to win oh honey its been that way since its conception
its not even that bad since when have you actually needed a revive for one character and even when you do you can just restart and hope for better rng luck
bai lu oh
did any chinese players complain because we all already know that global players will never got their attention anyway even if majority of the player complain if chinese player kept silence about this well lets just say that castorice is just the beginning
it wasnt as broken as people say the char will still die even after revives if you want to say broken mydei is even more broken can revives more times than you think
good lord hsr players are so whiny and full of crybabies
absolutely pointless pasive if your chatacter dies thats a skill issue ee
i think castorice should be free for everyone especially for fp and new players
save and pull or play better ig no arguments on either side have enough ground or reasonability to sway the other like every disagreement ever
i had no issue until i heard it works even if she isnt in the party thats basically now a whole new mechanic that having her gives that is unfair and pay to win if you ask me
global passives are the death of this game awful idea
everyday i wake up following gacha social medias o disappoint myself a bit more both from watching and getting people to view me as this thrashbag community note in reality most of the comunnity is fine the dark side is mainly x and social media people
i think is not to bad remember the only character can revive party only bailu as i remember and this game we cannot use items to revive party i play turn base rpg and always have party members get knock out so with castorice passive ability i can use party one turn her ability only make party have one turn after that they knock out but if you use heal to that members they not knock out so if there no healer in your party game over for real
this pasive is basicly useless if my character can die i obvliously cannot make it in end game content becaus you need a certain amount of dmg withing a certain amount of turns
i support castorice passive since the game already has too much hp inflation and fp cant even finish floor moc without too much farming and the bosses have high dmg and speed which gives them many chances to kill you plus ppl need to have speed boots on all their characters to keep up with the bosses and will lower their attack because of it
the revive from castorice is not the problem why people are mad but the fact that global passives are gonna become pwin likeglobal passives for extra spdcritdmgerbreak effect and so on but revive is like meh
normally if it not work on endgame contents no one will care abt this but no it does
global passives are now a thing its no matter a matter of if they will ruin the game but when
at first i was all chill till you said even not in the team
excuse not in the team how tf is that even allowed
and just like that they will create a ton of gp skills like this and even more broken
i feel like people are way too heated by this like im not pulling for castorice but like its not that big of a deal imo people keep using the slippery slope fallacy to say this is setting a precedence but like idk
for me id say i wouldnt mind the feature as long as it cant be activated in moc pure fiction and all that type of content
this revive is just mid most of the times if you die at moc you still gonna die even with this revive i only scared if this global buffs gonna give something like stat buff in future
this forces nothing the game will be just as beatable with stars as it always has
it okay if we can use only one global passive
this is basically just the guts ability in fgo
yes because its very much pay to win its disgusting
yall crying too much
pw what exactly is win in this game the story is easy to clear you dont have to pay if it is clearing the endgame modes what is the reward more pulls is it worth it i think not you can get at least half of the reward without paying anyway if you say getting your fav characters i agree so save your pulls and not be a meta slave so you win
im still gonna use her so i dont rly care
so ppl bitching abt a bailu but better im getting her either way let the bitches bitch ive saved for her since mommy herta
i love the idea as well so all in all lore wise indeed
i got mydei next is castorice
warum sollte sie unverzichtbar sein schon mal endgame gespielt da geht es vorallem darum gegner in einer bestimmten anzahl an runden zu besiegen da hilft eine einmalige wiederbelebung nichts null
not for nothing but if youre dying in end game its never just one character going down once its a novelty at best definitely not worth the hate
people who honestly believe her passive is pw really dont know how to play the game lol the only times ive ever failed a quest dying was in super high difficulty divergent or simulated universe and because i had crappy luck with blessings and curios yeah she makes it somewhat easier but so did fu xuan when she came out and its the same since she was ran in every single team regardless when doing high diff content
lore accurate my ass welt should be op as hell then his power is controlling black hole
its power creep like crazy if it was lore reasons why not only make it affect the team shes on they are going to destroy the balan e of the game by introducing global passives and its already pretty poor as is
only hp honestly bailu is better at that point just stack hp on her
just stop crying the game never forces you guys to spend money if you guys dont like it just delete the game and find another games dont forget that hsr is freetoplay also that passive isnt even overpowered how is this paytowin lol im sorry if this sounds harsh but stop blaming the game with unreasonable reasons you guys must not forget that this is a gacha game its more enjoyable when you play it for the fun of summoning new favorite characters and leveling up the characters you summons stop thinking about character performance
how is this pay to win uh when your entire party gets one tapped and you get to keep playing is not something anyone else has not even bailu but ok buddy retarrd stop thinking character performance have you ever played a fucking strategy game without the right people you dont win and the goal is to idk win you licked toilets as a kid and it shows
hey just win
since they havent changed it i believe we can expect more future global passive units and where we can select which one passive from the bunch to make it balanced
just shut up dude you keep repeating the same thing over and over again
i for one will be getting her regardless i am a huge fan of the character and i am actually in the market for a quantum dps
if you okay with her being lord of death then in after this they will create lord of power with plus dmg to you team if you get that character
i wont pull for her i just pulled the orange cat im broke now
meh its mostly gonna affect new players endgame nolifeers with good stats cycle aint gonna notice the difference
i dont care actually i wanna donate all x packs to her er just cuz she is pure poor girl who deserves all hugs and headputs she want
so bailu doesnt exist now seriously no one remembers her
if we want to make everything so lore accurate then make blade revive every time hes downed and make almost all of the xianzhou characters follow the path of the hunt its not castorices global passive thats the problem but the global passives in general the first isnt really strong but what will the tenth global passive be bonus crit dmg bonus health dont be so naive to think that hyv can keep the powercreep under control atp
bru no matter how her lore looks in the game thats no excuse to ruin the flow of the game that passive is not good at all we wouldnt mind if it was only effective when shes in the team but thats too much
so that literally means if you combine her with bailu she is pay to win immediately
its not even full hp why is people complaining
a gacha game being pay to win couldnt be
scamvidia for gaming amd for gaming
nothing here is pay win castorice is only nd char that can do that we basicaly have simular mech since day bailu can do same thing also once to a single ally and even better at c she can do it times so for me that is nothing broken ir overpowered plus castorice constinatly consuming entire teams hp while bailu focuses on healing so  think that balances everything and thia i my personal veaw on this little kids stop ruin the games with your crying all the fng time becose off it even voice actors in games quiting they jobs even thou its not they problem insted of crying spend some time to invest in games and gather some gems to pull for favorite chars that way u dont need to cry every single faking time that u cant pull since castorice was known to everyone that she be on realese on patch from new region released so u had many time to gather gems for her and get her for free i personalu have already over k ofc have to skip chars but thats ok for me anyway kids stop cry and play the games ir u dont play and only cry dont play at all
if they die in moc one revive wont make the game easy for them
wouldve pulled for this character now im definitely not disgusting precedent
so its basically like bailu but worst
so its just like that dragon healer on the standard banner
castorice bailu
can someone explain the deal with this because why are people cryong over a passive that is lore related it not like they will do this every patch like the acheron or fexiao ultimate because i saw some what can stop them adding res penetration like how they will make this lore accuret
i have a doubt does castorice need speed below if healer or any harmony character increases speed of all other members then crit stat will be lossed or not pls help
op i mean most of my team are built not to die so castorice passive doesnt even work for percent of my teams i guess it will be good if something happens that was unexpected but its not broken if i build my teams to stay alive anyways
this passive isnt even going to be much of an effect if you need the passive to do any form of content im pretty sure you have bigger problems and yes it sets a bad precedent future passives may be even worst but thats for the future enjoy what you have now instead of worrying about a future possibility and if you quit because of this good you simply wanted to quit for a long time and didnt have a big spark to make it happen
likejust skip her if u dont want your game to be too easy
cas global passive is bad for the future its fine if cas passive revive teammates for each teammate this makes her different from standard character bailu
what ifs drama you guys has no life or something fighting over this kind of thing just play the game if you dont like it stop playing simple
personally i welcome this mechanic i mean when was the last time we have a character capable of reviving others
they feel it is a must to get her because it makes end game easier meaning that it can still be done without her which means that her situation is the same as any other new character where they make end game content easier due to power creep it is only a problem if her global passive is mandatory to beat end game and not a luxury
were upset cause even if u think this passive doesnt bust the game it absolutely does theirs the fact that little things pile up over time into big things now its just a revive mechanic but tmrw its gonna be crit dmg if you pull this support unit then its gonna be crit rate on ultimates now you cant even beat moc cause the bosses have been hp inflated to account for dps units with crit rate crit damage this ruins the game this isnt fun
there is no thing such as must have you dont like it skip it
im confused can anyone tell me what global passive is and whats wrong with it
they shouldve put it on a male character im ready to see the pitchforks lol
can we not all just agree that her global should have stayed strictly while she is in battle there was literally reason for it to be global when not even bailus fu xuans or scooby doos are global also to me her even just having a revive is stupid why does the girl that brings death revive teammates shouldve stayed with her sacrificing a teammate instead
it honestly doesnt bother me
we are going to have even more global passives in the future because they did this with castorice
sorry to disappoint but they are making money based on the sales of people buying stellar jade and battle passes and such its already free to download and they give you free characters in events but at the end of the day money is what keeps the quality of graphics design of characters and the gameplay and how they pay their voice actors and other staff if youre looking for something that you download for free and want a completely free to play game then your looking at a perfect world that doesnt exist get real people
shes not wildhunt heathcliff bro
i mean baizu exists
fr idk why they crying about this plus the global passive have to be related to the lore but they think that a character can in the futur give dammage boost because of a passive like how they will make this lore accute they just gonna add passive a years but no they crying over something that is not op
bailu
yeah we might have not gotten a revive character in a while but i still think global passive will just completely screw everything over they shouldve limited it to her team and we would still have a revive character
yeah its pretty unique and i like it if its just a fun immersive mechanic related to the characters lore as long as it doesnt become strongtoo good that its a necessary
fazexd im not sure about castorice lore but the interesting story about her revive mechanic i believe is tied to the legend she is based on which is castor and pollux you should look it up its quite an interesting read and it makes her global passive more sense
so bailu just doesnt exist no offense
pixelated_gamers technically the last character who can revive others is fu xuan if you e her but abundance path wise is bailu
fr like you dont speak pull for moc because you want jades
hoyo trying to ruin their game again
youre a massive restarted detergent if you defend this slop
the funniest part to me watching all of this controversy around castorices global passive is the people saying that global passives are going to be must pull characters when in reality theres absolutely no basis or reasoning that supports this there might be if the game had any kind of competitive nature like pvp or leaderboards but its doesnt youre not competing with anyone no one else who has global passives is going to affect your gameplay and i guarantee that you will not fall behind in moc or any of the endgame modes in the long run if you skip castorice for a future character or any other global passive characters that follow stop comparing yourself to other peoples accounts and play the game for fun if you want to use the character pull them and if you dont then dont it really is that simple
it might work lore wise but this means that hoyo will make more specific skill characters you must pull for and since they lock some important stats you need for a character to function properly behind eidolons this will get even worse with specific characters you need to pull its the greedy practices that hoyo is adding to the game which is the issue
great ability should have only been active with her in team tho
bro the passive okay on paper sounds broken but in actuality and in practice isnt stronggood be real whats the chances of your healershielder going before your dps that got down ur basically screwed so you get extra attack and more so then likely youll have used your shielders or healera ult already trying to survive the huge attack
but when acheron gets a passive that allows her to skip battles and is to this day the most ridiculous pw quality of life no one bats an eye and when a dps absolutely requires another unit to function like jq to ach or sunday to jyaglaea etc thats not a problem either oh and lets not forget that this game asks upwards to k for any unit just to powercreep them in a patch but yeah its this new passive thats the issue oh its such a big problem whatever shall we do in this gacha game the entire fking system is a disgrace to gaming and we all support it but noo its the passive thats the problem boii stfu this is only a problem cause ccs that no longer play the game still want to create drama around it and yall have no opinion of your own so u go and parrot them just play the game or uninstall crying about it wont do anything
guys its not just about this passive or the ones after it remember that the devs is looking into making a coop pvp gamemode and god knows what that may bring about
as i said before but the precedent i will not review bomb a game for a it might happen and no one is forcing you to pull her like if you already found dificult to survive in moc it might be a good time to get good at the game lol
i dont really care whats going on shes cute so i am pulling for her
cant wait for the acheron with global passive to one shot every enemy lore accurate as thay said
castorice is gonna be broken
if this meta trend only apply on hoyogamesidcgo ahead make more global passivebut the thing make me worry iswhen people normalise this kind of passivethe other gacha company will started follow the trend just to boost the revenueand later on there will always character that u must pulls even tho u dont like it that what im worryinidc what happen to hsr but i do care what will happen to other gacha games
while its a powercrept it wasnt that broken and they created a characters for you to get bro
i already decided to pull her before knowing the global thing i just want a quantum damage dps my current dps is queque
ah yes lets hate on the op power of a literal demigod and lets also compare her to seele an yo mortal girl that doesnt have proper education lives in the slumps with not much food learn to fight from just surviving and can swing a pretty big scythe like castorice its so bs that people ignore the background of a character and only care about the end strength of said character like whats next youre going to compare nanook the aeon of destruction against clara a child and called it power creep just because they are both destruction characters
man you dont need the character thothey aint forcing youmy black swan archon healer dude star and kafka still got me up to date n im fine
but its only once per battle lol
its not even pvp
i think if she has to be on the squad it is more than ok idk why they are crying every minutes its fp
explain because i just dont care about this passive but you guys are creating drama over a meh passive so i want to know why you guys are mad for me this will likely add global passive for strong lore accute character so one a years plus i hear a lot of people tell what if they add attack buff bu who they will make this lore accute at the end there is no must pull like du can be clean with every character and you just dont spend pull to get jade from moc
i just want you or someone to explain me what the deal like really because i really just saw you guys like this
bro this clown is literally defending this crap yeah you people are cooked
i rly dont understand all the hate like ofc they have to make unique characters and besides its not even that op its only once per battlr and most of the time revive is not gonna be a game changer and if the character is bad players cry and if the character is unique and good players cry like wtf
thats it my god i need to get used to this level of powercreep ive been traumatised by my games power creep
just pull lol the inflation aint gonna wait for you buddy bois the only thing that can be a monetized by these games are the hype around these characters so to keep the game engaging they need to bump up the enemys health and release characters that follow through their with they hp inflation its not like there is that much of a skill ceiling to begin with only speed tuning and orders not like genshin and zz where you can dodge and shi the devs know full well what these powercreeps do and the engage in it fully its just that there is so many crybabys that still wants their half built seele to clear moc this game is a gacha game i would even go as far to say that the skill in hsr is just to plan your teams and plan who to pull as i said not a hack and slash not a adventure game a gacha turn based game
for me this is awesome
if they dont like it they should quit easy get out of the game lol
revive with hp is not broken its practically useless what is a problem is adding other characters with actual broken passives that make whole teams viable or not based on who you whaled for
she only powercreep bailu
it might be bugged
thats it
well i have to smash things on the way to craft healing items to its a plus and i pray that they have an off switch
wait theres a fucking meta in star rail dude i havent touched the game in ages and i come back and try to play no wonder why im struggling so hard
bailu does the same but she must be alive and not frozestun
how about we dont pay for castorice
im glad hoyo didnt listen to the minority complaining to make the global passive like bailu only
yall are just crying at this point now when they try to nerf it people will accuse hoyo of weakening the characters so much just like accept what theyre giving you bru nobody cares if you dont want her then dont pull if you really dont like it then dont pull for her why are yall just so mad at the dumbest thing
this is absurd bailu has the same passive ability and its fine
people are saying powercreep and stuff and yet people forget that mydei just cant die on his own
would be good if every star a unique passive and can only have passives on
people who dont like it must not be guaranteed in the
i mean why not just make the skill activate when castorice is in the team i mean okay revive mechanic on her is aligned with her lore but man they dont need to make it a global passive
if its lore acc then give her for free like xd cuz in lore she is in our team type shit yes idea is good but not in damn gacha with things like moc or stuff like that xdd
a chacter is bad like mydeiomg why is he so bad skip a chacter is good like castoriceomg shes too op why did hoyo make this if yall cant like bad chacter and cant like good chacters what do you want hoyo to do
all people who complain about her passive still bound to pull her anyway global passive is bad because what if think thats what you call a slippery slope
great feature but not in a live service game
lol she just revive with hp lol how is ut broken
imagine saying pw in a single player game
nah i dont want my wallet go to heaven dawg
the thing is her passive wouldnt allow you to do endgame content any easier as you think she doesnt revive you permanently so you need to heal them or give them shield or the character would still be downed theres a butterfly icon beside the character health bar this mean that you cant even run a sustainless team comp at all unless your blade who can heal your self or mydei with his ultimate its not as broken as people think its pretty balance for a global passive because it doesnt allow you to run a crazy sustainless run without a worry it doesnt effect the damage of your character because its not a buff towards damage this doesnt make her a must must pull rather supports like jq is far more valuable than her and is a even more must pull than her you dont necessarily need her passive what you need to fix or help your account is proper invested supports invest in them thats what will help you clear end game content not just casto anyways thats my personal opinion i dont like whats coming for the future but i also dont hate her since shes not as broken as people may make her seems to be
tbh i wouldnt mind if they do one of these things make castorice free to everyone if global passive it should only be anniversary characters with a global buff they should give her a global debuff as well and to turn off the debuff you must turn off the buff just dont add it
nah i have bailu and she does the perfect job that way that cute dragon lady literally saved the master diviner during nikadors battle
the global passive is not the main reason that forces player to pull for new characters and making this game a pw game the inflation of enemy health is
this is like mydei immortal passives at e again
both statement is correct id rather it works like bailu revive tho rather than global
yes its not op but thats not the pointthe point is that now that they have introduced gobal passive what the fuck makes you think they wont be doing it again for other characters
its basically useless without healing or shields and if you have that then you shouldnt die
future star characters passives be like obtain stellar jades per day
genshin in coming
i remember when this game first came out i was excited about all the type of playstyles and tactics you could do by what you prefer preseveration tanking dps hunt etc but now its just powercreep and meta gonna get my anni rewards then uninstall until something draws me in enough cuz wuwa needs its space
imagine being so bad at planning your pulls that you see getting a single copy of a character as pw womp womp glad that hoyo didnt flinch and this passive makes it into the game
i dont even care i like her design so i pull
and the global passive will have a pretty big chance of the devs making the inflation of enemy health even worst so it kinda is even if its indirect
youre blaming global passives for a problem they didnt cause castorices passive boosts survival not damage it doesnt contribute to hp bloat at all your claim just doesnt hold up assuming the devs will abuse global passives for monetization is pure speculation focus on whats actually broken not what you think might happen game development is a gradual process if future global passives do include offensive utility thats a balance issue not proof of malicious intent enemy hp inflation is real global passives arent the problem theyre just support tools that got better
youre talking about monetization and malicious intent when i never talked about it im just telling that now that global passive exist they will inevitably make some at some point that increase your damage output and most likely not just once and of course these global passive will be taken into account for the hp scalling and the player that did not get the character with said global passive wont just be able to summon the new character to have the perfect dmg output to go against the hp scalling since theyll have missed a certain amount of damage scalling global passive also i know global passive didnt create the hp scalling problem but they will make it worst except if the dev decide to not take global passive dmg up when making the hp scalling but its more of a dream than what will happen
you surely didnt mention monetization but i did because that was my original point pw is driven by hp inflation not global passives then you say you didnt mention malicious intent but youre literally assuming future global passives will boost damage assuming devs will scale hp around them and assuming that players who skip them will be permanently behind zero evidence pure speculation that is implying malicious intent just with extra steps thats like saying im not accusing the school of scamming kids i just know they might eventually make calculators mandatory and then might as well start selling overpriced calculators and the kids who dont buy them will probably fail math so we better blame them now before that happens global passives existing doesnt guarantee theyll boost damage or be used to justify hp inflation thats a textbook slippery slope yes we should call out bad balancing when it happens but until a global passive actually breaks hp scaling youre blaming the rain before theres even a cloud crying wolf over what might happen only derails real discussion
the hsr community some complain about everything like damn hoyo give you more rerun banners yall complain about it having too many banners when you asked for it you dont have to pull on every banner chill tf out now yall complain about the global passive okay just skip it you dont have to pull for her shes just lore accurate some of yall is just unbelievable
dawg bailu can do that too and shes the worst healer
people havent heard of reruns
the video really fails to mention that if the character that gets downed and gets revived by her passive isnt healed or shielded afterwards they will still die again forcing you to have sustains so sustainless runs arent possible with her
so no one talks about jingliu and stellaron hunter buffs
just change it so it only works when she is in the party and its fine
i dont see the problem its just like every new character in genshin
new power creeped enemiesnew power creeped characters isnt this normal at turn based games or do i mistake something
uh bailu also does that you just need her in the team
ngl idc how it works as long as the game is still playable
she was already a must pull as soon as the dragon came out and put that godzilla blast on the enemies its a single player game and she isnt a must pull for reviving someone people need to stop whining all the time
imagine dying in hard content
i think they nurfed her passive so that it is balanced people who think this is pay to win are stupid and probably keep dying i swear if castorice gets revamped she will still get hated by the freaking community i have a feeling that almost all members of this fandom are children just lore accurate dont cry nice
bro the deadly sins has worse passvies how is this unfair like in the deadly sevens game there is a passive that straight up makes everyone on the field take dmg if they dont attack
it doesnt force anything i dont care what her passive does shes a woman so i wont pull for her
thats good if its just once per battle wtf why everybody crying
really is this what breaks the camels back are you guys fucking kidding me the herta can use her technique to find chests right well itll be active regardless if shes on the team or not its significantly more op than castorices global passive since it simply feeds you jades for free sorry to sound rude but you guys are fucking stupid if this is whats considered too far than why complain now why boycott now smh besides its a onetime revive for each unit per battle which barely even matters since if a unit managed to have died once already then clearly the chance that theyll die again is just as high as the first death
the passive itself is not broken at all i dont know what yall are doing i cant recall the last time anyone on my teams has died the problem is that it opens the door for other more powerful passives later on
honestly if you need revives to beat endgame content then maybe you shouldnt touch the endgame content and just stick to story mode
i dont see it as a bad thing with a good sustain you team will not die anyway like sure if one get killed and get revive is strong they shouldnt be dying in the first place
just so you understand the complain about the her global passive well first its not about the effect because its kinda ass if a character just revive with hp then everything can kill it immediatly after so it could be usefull but it most likely wont the problem is the idea of a character buffing your team even when its not in your team for now its not a big deal because the effect is bad but when a character will come out with a global passive that add attack or crit chance or crit damage or anything that help do more damage then itll be a bigger problem and if you still dont see the problem then think about multiple global passive of that caliber stacking and how the devs will try to balance monster hp and then realise that most people wont have all of them and the hp scalling will be impossible to go through if you dont put money in the game or even if you put just a little bit of money but not enough
siphons i am aware of all that you are saying and the fact that people are mad about the idea of the global passive but thats not what im trying to convey if you read all of the message i said that when the hoyo com wanted more banners for their favorite characters hoyo included multiple banners of characters for multiple versions for the com to pull and some of you still complained about it in simple terms if you dont like whats going on in the game just simply quit if you dont like what theyre making or you deal with whats going on thats the only options im seeing but at the end of the day your still playing the game arent you and obviously they arent changing it and its already confirmed no use in complaining about it anymore plus you can still play the game and clear endgame rewards without her
mistaplayssd for your first point yes i did thats why i specifically said the complain about her global passive not why people complain in general also people are allowed to be annoyed and express the thing that they find annoying not that i understand it for the multiple banners but dont except people to not complain for your second point people like a game for its entirety not just the gameplay and thats the same thing for star rail people partly like it for the gameplay yes but also for the characters the story the worldbuilding the scenery so yes people wont just stop playing because of a thing that is getting sligtly worsthas the potential on becoming a problem however they might do if the hp scalling become such a problem that the fight become more frustrating than anything and the idea of global passive can and will surely worsen the hp scalling problem and they wont stop feeling relieved or happy but sad that they cant keep experiencing all the other part of the game that they still love because of the gameplay if you want me to use an example that isnt game then lets take food think of your favorite food or at least one of your favorite food imagine then than in the near future an ingredient needed and cant be replaced for said food start to become more and more expensive even with that price being bigger and bigger youll still want to eat that food since its one you love however you wont be able to eat it as much as you want until one day the ingredient is too expensive for you to buy at that point youll have to stop eating that favorite food and you will feel sad that you might never be able to reexperience such a great food ever again now lets replace the ingredient by the fights in star rail the price by the frustation given to you by the game and the love by the enjoyment given to you by the game do you understand a bit better why people complain and not just stop playing also i dont know where to put that but you said at the end you can still play the game and clear endgame rewards without her and i answer to you that the problem is not her the problem is the potential bigger problem that will happen when new characters with a global passive will arrive and said passive upgrade damage of your characters and stacks with older ones and that is one thing i already said
siphons okay i totally agree and understand what youre saying but like hoyo gon do hoyo they dont really listen to the community that much anyway like they should they should also follow kuro games example like if you play wuwa then yk how kuro do but anyways im prob still gonna pull for her bc i love her animations and designs soyeaand i also think hsr players are mostly likely to boycott the banner cus of the global but if you really think about it like you said it is ass but thanks for explaining i was just being stupid forgive me for my ignorance
mistaplayssd boycotting wont do anything i saw some people in that comment section say that there were leaks with other character with global passive so boycotting would amount to nothing and even if it could the amount of people that would entirely stop playing thats what boycotting is not just not pulling wouldnt be a lot compared to people that would keep playing because they either dont care or just dont follow news and just wait to be surprised pleasently by the game and im probably gonna do the same i prepared a team for her patch ago before i knew anything of her kit and i kinda dont want it to go to waste so yeah i like the character and its enough of a reason to pull
siphons wait fr i didnt know they were other characters with a global passive
mistaplayssd for now its leaks so i dont know how correct it is but even without leaks its obvious they wouldnt just stop with character
isnt this hoyo trying to help everyone by trying to not powercreep too much like im sure more future characters will have global passives and then one day you get that character and think this is nice and youll be contradicting yourself
does it mean that i can finally die for once i forgot what the animation looks like already
to be honest yes its op but i dont think its essential its not like the game suddenly becomes impossible if you dont have castorice there are people onecycling the hardest game content out there its not like they needed her either
what ya mean complaining to a game about it being pay to win while having a gatcha system youre upset because you cant have it its part of life anyways not all people can get to have a free vila
if u dont want cassie then pull for other characters no ones forcing them to pull geez
well this global passive aint so broken literally revives you hp and bam hoolay destroys you again
i think castorice global buff is pretty useless and she isnt must have but if hoyo will develop global buffs
people like to cry
seems to make the game pay to win its a gacha game the whole idea behind it is pay to win but i do think global passives are not going to be healthy for the game
why are people acting likes they are being forced to get her
dont take twitter ppl seriously they always find something to argue about
bruh if you dont wantbthat character why bother pulling just stop the hating
i personally dont see this being an issue i mean most people dont let there characters die anyway i do concede though that it could be a sign of global passives being made to strong and game difficulty being changed because of those but if they keep it simple these could be a fun addition either way im not calling out doom until i see it as a huge problem
if you pull you pull dont wanna dont i see no issue
its not even that important with sustain and meta team you cant even die that easily with or without castorice is not saving you from endgame content it saving you from divergent universe
honestly as a casual who has seen enough with the controversy seeing how much im struggling with new bosses im not complaining at all i feel like too many people are overreacting to this
broken or not castorice is waifu pull who you want dont pull for meta pulling for meta will make the game no longer fun pull characters that you want and enjoy i will pull castorice because waifu
it could bring more passives that really break the game like idk a character that gives you crit damage even if not in the party or something
even if she wasnt so op or if she wasnt a new character or a i would still pull for her i really like her desing
what the even if not on team
youre not getting the point castorice is a sign of whats to come if one character has global passives then more will have them too we dont want that
exactly a lot of people need to learn to read this kind of thing always comes with a handicap built in also if you dont want that passive just dont pull for her
full dps team will be meta now
they say forces theyre just stupid they arent being forced to pull for her
funny thing ill stop playing most gacha by september the only game i still play is wuwa and epic i need to focused on my game list to play ive been putting a lot of game on hold
people cry a lot lol
my unpopular opinion or view of point of mine in this mechanic is castorice being too powerful that she powercrept everyone it kinda makes me sad but revival with or without her lets go
i feel like it was a coding accident most gameplay coding doesnt need to be checked with the character off field so it couldve been an accident that cant be fixed until the next game versionupdate its not that deep
its literally like having bailu passives at once one per character it also opens the door for even more broken global passives in the future its ridiculous
people who still lickings hoyo shoes dont even think that is the start global buff character that literally makes everyone need the character because you dont even need to bring the character imagine in the future you cant progress because you need this character that has a global buff that blocks time lethal damage because the enemy gimmick is wiping your team if you cant clear dps check
yall just mad
the gacha game is pay to win really omg i never realized that the game were i can drop dollars to get ez mode was pay to win man these devs are out of their mind man let me tell you
if global passive buff shows up only on anniversary thatll be ok to me actually but atleast give it to eminators so its more lore accurate and makes sense
does not matter i will pull her even she doesnt have such an ability on the contrary i wont pull it even there is such a cheat but its a male character
lets be honest if you are downed and revived with hp your complete lack of skilluck still wont save you
pay to win the game is pve
why are people being too cheesy just look at the gameplay later it definitely wont be that op because the system is directly resurrected and many enemies have atkturn which may or may not be very useful the endgame content also requires that there is no party that falls im using google translate xd
castorice is the new bailu
review bombing wont help lol that will just make them commit to global passive buff because they would think that castorice is not popular enough rather thinking shes too broken because to hoyo castorice doesnt seem broken and her global passive is not broken the problem everyone is having right now isnt because shes broken but because people are worried that future characters will have global passives as well however this wont be an issue if hoyo never releases another global passive character so we can only see if hoyo will only make castorice the only global passive character
im still going to pull for her anyway when she has her first leak i was determined to pull for her even when her first leak was leaked i didnt know she had that global passive
butit is pay to win game
people really thinking power up good if they introduce this gimmick better put it in archivment or something so people can grind for this
skill issues
bro when you star floor of moc you are not suppose to have a down character everyone be like oh no i keep dying
there another healer that does almost the same thing bui but as long as she is alive people are blow shit out of portion
how is it pw when just because you have character which can revive other characters doesnt mean that you will get strong and plus if you have a good sustain which can also do damage doesnt that do the trick so ya rather stressing over somthing like this just go and stress about how to build your other characters ps hsr is the only action rpg i have played so dont know if my opinion is relevant
hsr is still on app store on my phone
the buff itself is fine but now that w have the global buff they will probably do it with other character an knowing hsr the piwercreep will be so bad like the next global i which i hope w neve get could probably be like a crit rate and damage buff to every character like that should never be a thing unless everyone has free access to it
free anaversari character
they thould give her for free
last year with acheron the complaints about the novelty of the ultimate without energy was that it left the characters focused on giving energy huohuo tingyun useless and it was to implement another type of powercreep this year there was going to be no shortage of complaints about the annual novelty no matter what they released there were going to be cries anyway
not gonna lie its really a must character especially in this inflation i still going for hyacine tho dont get me wrong i really like castorice because she remind me of griseo but i gonna pass and get hyacine i will get castorice in her rerun
have fun with compulsory pulls with global passive or youll ruin your account by not getting stronger bunch of stupid losers who are still playing hsr
im pretty sure any gacha developer can tell you that this just goes against all common sense selling an account perk disguised as a character and pretending its not predatory or incentive to further break your games balance hsrs powercreep is just objectively bad after this its gotten so unenjoyable to play over time and this just seals it for me i probably wont even come around for the anniversary because this games future is doomed the story sucks the characters suck and have the most repetitive designs in any gacha ive seen wow another girl in halter top dress with exposed armpitsshoulders and detached sleevesarm acessories but in new color the kits are terribly balanced you cant play with your own personal favourites anymore with how drastically even the base games new worlds demand you use the new characters at their release time endgame sucks nothing good here anymore
im fp and im not mad at it only whales are salty about this when fp pull for her for free
it would make sense if she was given out for free
why are people so mad about when hoyo does stuff to get revenue anyways they arent making the game for our fun they doin it for moneu
if you die then its just skill issues
so basically its like bailu but broken
people who calling it lore accurate shut your damn bs up idk why you all keep begin slaves to hoyo but this is what you get for playing the game of a company which wouldnt give damns about any of you expect for the whales who spend thousands upon thousands on the games like fools and waste their life savings
guys nothing forces you to get a character meta sucks just pull whoever you want and for rewards they suck too dont bother much and go play cookie run kingdom
they either fix it by giving her for free or nerf the revive
this makes no sense the whales are gonna get the character regardless whereas fp players who lose the are cooked if they havent been saving for patches
the game makes not pulling meta characters increasingly difficult with all the hp inflation tho
at first glance it looks broken on paper but then you start to list things down works only once and it only revives to hp this might not work very well when enemies are fastmulti turn with aoe and some priority targeting in their ai in the end this ability doesnt look all that potent it can be a great situational failsafereversal mechanic but then again its gonna be down to the enemy compsositions
i find it cringe in general how people let themselves be slaves of a game to the point something that they dont like dictates their mood clearing the moc its just temporary satisfaction i cant even clear fully at all but im not crying over it ur not forced to spend but if u find reasons to spend meta changing must have broken sounds like a u problem
a one hit point revive isnt saving anyone especially against hoolay lmao
im not against it or supportive of it if you die in hsr then thats a skill issue theres healers and shielders that do what they have to do her revive is so extra and somewhat uselessunecessary
i say they give every character a unique global passive to balance it out some
lore accurate powrcreep is why i quit hsr since i kept getting soft locked without jingliu
likes castorice castorice is insanely powerful has enough pity and pulls to guarantee her happy
now i dont agree with most of the controversies but i agree with this one it should not work when she is not in the team
its just revive surely its not really that must have if you dont want to pull for her or lost the if you like her pull if not then no
then what is she supposed to do this fits her per lore
even if its coherant no character should have a passive that work outside of teams
i dont mind global passive but the fact that is something u get instantly without having to even invest in the units is a disappointment
i give a shit
on one hand i want to skip her out of protest on the other ive been planning to pull her since the first amphoreous trailer dropped i cant win
it would be fine if it was only while she was in the team
also if she gets an effect out of feild future characters will probably have it too but even stronger
please do not let these people play dragon ball legends if they think thats pw
if they wanted to make it lore accurate then having revival while shes on the team rather than a global passive would make way more sense stupid hoyo decisions killing their game yet again
complaining that a character is really really useful is absolutely batsht crazy to me
its not that the revive is broken but the possibility of new characters being able to provide account wide buffs eg new character giving account wide atk buff
bro really has no enemies o
maybe because there are people out there who dont want castorice i mean the revive serves purpose for veteran players so its not a huge deal rn but if they incorporate global passive that boost account wide damage my account will never see the light of day again
i dont think its much of use out side of her own team cuz if youre skill issue enough to die once youll die again
while the thought of a global passive can be a slippery slope castorices passive is pretty weak all things considered it looks strong on paper but thats about it players who feel forced to pull for her because of it are just over exaggerating but we should still keep an eye on how they manage future global passives
i honestly dont care about it i just think shes cool and her dragon is legendary
laughs in bailu
i mean if that is really it it wont help much either as with hp they still wont last longer than next enemy action unless right circumstances
well obviously its a cash grab whether or not hoyo genuinely wants castorice being pulled for bc of some other obscure reason money is still gonna come in
yall hsr is a pay to play game are we really surprised at this point
just deal with it its a video game lol
hsr players nah thats just straight up cheating barbara havers wait you guys didnt have that
this is a turnbased game character get outdated quickly i have no problem with those global mechanics bc they might be one way to keep the value of that certain characters if you said something like then it become a must pull what if i dont have the character its not like that the character is not gonna have a rerun in fact this game can have characters rerun at the same time probably more in the future and i know this is a toxic take if you feel like it ruined the game for you then dont play it play something else it is not worth it to invest your time into something that you dont feel like it especially games
okay
bailu revives too no its not that overpoweredjust usr hp scaling chars or a preservationabundance unit
its a single player game who really gives a fuck
i do find it a bit op i think they maybe should have made it so that this passive would happen when she used her technique and lasting even after youd change teams and until youd kill the enemy so youd have to waste a technique point each time and so you couldnt make all teams you have in endgame content have it
so if we have her and dragon healer we can get back up at least times
hsr fell off so hard just seeing the many shorts on the powercreep is making me glad i left
i got a real question who are the players that wil benifit this global passive endgame players veterans heck no like im pretty sure they wont get the chance to even use it since we would have clear the stage before that opputunity present itself this is only useful to new and mid players that are still building up their st or nd team just a bit of helping hands especially the ones complains about not having a strong healer shielder another usage is in du especially on the higher difficulties if it really that much of a problem might as well just have a toggle button to turn off the passive
if you need this passive to clear end game content you got bigger issues on your account
its just a revive with hp a lot of time its useless especially with star tingyun
one time revive is no use unless youre in near victory situation so ill say you make your team truly stronger that can tank hits and deal damage then no death is even needed
comments like this are why so many games go to shit and developers find themselves being lost and perpetually unsure about how to approach making changes to make their players happy not that it really applies here because its a gacha game eith predatory sysmtems in place that are designed to take your money but i think the main concerns lie within the future of the game casotrices passive serves absolutely purpose as it stands my issue would be if they add some bs like res pen def down attack or hp boosts account wide to a character i have interest in if that happens im quitting

barbara doesnt have a global passive
this is a global passive she will revive you even if she isnt in your team
realquarlie just speed tune better in sustainless comps or throw on any limited sustaingallagher and you beat the game with ease this might be a hot take but castorices passive is completely useless if youve been playing for long enough to have fully decked out teams consisting of at least a few recently released characters
bepo even with just a revive its really strong to have it as a global passive instead of relying on sustain you can now instead invest on pure damage a lot more it being a permanent upgrade for every team is too strong but moreso the bigger thing is the fact that this is just the developers testing the waters if we dont complain about it now they will add more global passives that may stretch even further what would you say when in a few months we get characters with global passives buffing atk or crit stats and the endgame slowly more and more relies on people having those global passives
realquarlie i never claimed to think global passives were a good idea infact ill come out and say it right now global passives will be the death of the game at this rate my entire point is that the revive itself is pretty useless for veterans or those with enough game knowledge i can totally see hoyo adding res pen and def shred as global passives or god forbid locking them behind eidolons
im sure many people will give a fuck when they scale the endgame bosses hp wuth the assumption in mind that players have access to multiple global passives since leaks suggest were getting more i refuse to play a game where i cant beat it because i dont have the global passive from a character i dont wantcare about the day they implement that is the day i quit for good
i still clear late game content with early characters
love how the argument is theyre trying to boost revenue and make money on a free game
just lore accurate dont cry just cuz its lore accurate doesnt mean it isnt pw or fair at all
basically bailu is now jobless lol
i think its absolutely ass sure this might be not too bad but this started something that will happen more in the future and powercreep in star rail is insanely crazy already i can only imagine other characters in the future getting a global passive too getting more op over time until you run a team with passive effects from characters you dont even use in battle i think this is really bad and it can lead into the worst game design ever if they go too crazy lets pray they really think a lot about this and dont go too far
i really dont think its that strong unless if youre a new player that doesnt have a good team built or try to force a sustainless comp the only bad thing is when global passives start power creeping
like genuinely it makes me not want to pull for her i love her design and animations and the dragon looks sick but the global passive seems like it will make endgame content trivial which makes the game boring im less mad about it from a powercreep perspective but more that its just shitty game design
both situations can be correct it can be a loreaccurate ability while also being a tactic hoyo would pull to boost sales
now zz is the only good game for trashverse lets see how it takes to also ruin that game lmao
look castorices global passive itself is not a big deal the problem is it opens the door for global passives imagine oh here if you pull this character then all your characters get a crit rate this is the problem that people have with this if this stopped with castorice then fine but we know this damn company wont stop with her and guess what other companys will follow in hoyo footsteps and do the same sht because if hoyo can get away with this there gonna think that they can too
i didnt quit because of castorice i quit because i pulled for the broken character came back a few months later and found out theres like different characters that are leagues better than her
thats why m not playing hsr anymore
i meann its a jojos bizarre adventure part stardust crusaders ref
i am just too excited for getting luoca for free i dont play the game that often anyway
looks its not about castorice having a revive since have a character that does that its the fact that it can also work when shes not even on the team so you could technically never build castorice and every team has that revive and to the players who are hoping that hoyo doesnt make upcoming global passives broken are dumbasses since we literally have examples where hsr introduced a mechanic and it changed the game in a negative way like the type res pen and implanting weaknesses they started off small at first and later on every character has it and no longer does the game revolve around having teams that matches the enemy weakness im starting to realize that hoyo makes games that has alot potential and later down the road they screw it up well unfortunately zz is next
how does it force anyone to do anything
you know you can just restart the battle anytime right imagine being unhappy over what happens inside a video game with that said i want to play with new more powerful characters playing with same old characters gets boring
i dont mind it as long as it doesnt count towards moc the same way bailou revive doesnt count
tbf the idea of global passive is weird
lets be honest though was anyone really going to skip her if you manage your resources correctly you should be able to get her
its a multi billion company bro they dont need anymore money
shes been benched since like
the endgame content is already trivial for veteran accounts
i was contemplating it
if they just made it so you are able to get global passives for free with a new feature i think it would fix the problem of global passives but since you need to pull the characters to get it is very predatory and scummy
lore accurate lol why my blade is not immortal and my aventurine doesnt bring me luck if we are talking about lore they should rework all older characters then
it doesnt revive them at hp you need to also heal them or provide a shield for them to be revived so this passive is useless on sustainless teams and if you are dying with sustain on your team i dont know what you are doing meanwhile no one talking about how anaxa ult just add all weakness on enemies meanwhile break dps like ff can only do boothill to and silver wolf to as well
this is honestly an overreaction cause like you guys get so many more pulls per update than us genshin players do so like there is no way you guys cant get her
i need her
why are yall so boring bro i cant wait till shes out
take note that castorice is an anniversary unit on top of being a waifu bait like ff yet they gave her a borderline useless global passive that is merely lore accurate revives with hp still enemy turn dies again if they planned to make broken passives in the future like permanent stat boost or dmg boost they would have given it to castorice in the first place why give an anniversary waifu bait character a useless passive the next character i can imagine getting this is cyrene with a turn reverse mechanic if she is mem you can go back a turn once per battle if you make a mistake instead of resetting the whole run anotber one i can think of is cipher having a global passive that increases the amount of credits you get when farming for it useless for long term players with millions of credits by now sitting around i doubt shed get one tho i have no idea what phainon will get which he obviously him and cyrene will have global passive im thinking of global passive in a creative way not through a negative lense that will just spiral me down to global passive that gives crit rate boost yada yada i view this as a new mechanic that makes a character more unique based on their character or lore i dont view it as making the character more generic by giving them just a simple free crit rate passive and thats it cool
its opening doors to worse things to comeimagine hsr or other games adopting this but with actual stat increases next
the problem people are missing isnt the revive but the global passive itself its going to make power creep even worse cause old units wont have these passives and the buffed character arent going to be getting them plus will the buffed older units be at the level of castorice or future dpssupports no definitely not cause the company wants to make money on the new character the glibal passives will get better over time and knowing hyv they will probably be giving stat boosts like crit and speed in the future making characters a must pull even if u arent building their archetype dot fua etc and this potentially leads to creating characters with bad kits but their global passives are a must ir ur account isnt performing at the max dmg potential its a predatory practice you ethier have to save reasources and u get like pull per patch or spend dollars to get a not including the its a clear money grab and people defending this global passive and coping are part of the problem they dont see how predatory it is and how it leads to to worse things sure its not gonna happen right away but look at genshin in and it was fine but now its shit the traverse is locked behind characters like mauvika and ut inly works in natlan and dendro was so op it broke the game for a long time makjng dendro a must global passives should have been in a system where everyone could get it without the requirement of getting a character a lot of games do this even gacha games through some kind of level up system or upgrade system where you spend in game currency at after a certain teir or level up get the passive or a choice to choose a global passive
hnmm i dont think that is broken
lore accurate or not she should not be this powerful
what are you complaining about she is the only character with a globe stuff yeah she is the only one because she literally just released everything will start after the first time and the problem here is the people who doesnt wants her on the first place so if i skipped her what that will make to my account worse than any accounts with her not the powercreep stuff no no they can get stronger characters on the future and still she is have that globe thing especially after the older characters buff promises
as usual its a waifu boost op mta breaking etc etc its ok that the ok people opinion if its a male omg powercreep look i will try her animation is crazy but that passive its disgusting and im sure it will b only waifu just like quantum and remembrance and nearly harmony but no hoyo isnt sexiste or raciste no
i just think thank goodness im guaranteed
wait till they lock these global passives behind esi can deff see them doing smthn like this down the line
too much what if and not enough solid evidence to justify the crying
it definitely sets a really bad precedent
the whole tactic to make money is not a great one if people are referring to a free to play game like hey guys we would like to make money on this game we are constantly updating for free like no shoot it is to make money
hsr takes skill hsr
ngl i like her designs and lore but imo hyv always favor the female too much so im just gonna skip the next ver and wait for phainon hopping they give him the same special treatment as her
if youre fp and you lose the and its a first half banner youre absolutely cooked lmao hoyo also releases characters per patch in hsr unlike genshin
bepo yes we do we sometimes get even characters and there is no way you cant save up cause like you aint pulling for every character i prefer to have at least pulls left unless i really want to max out a character so if i can save pulls there is no way you cant save up more if you get more pulls per patch
its hoyo verse if that isnt enough evidence then youre probably quite new to their games but youll find out soon enough once the next global passive has all type res pen
i dont understand why there is so much hate against this passive its not even as broken as it seems for example if your sustain dies it becomes useless as it only revives if the character is healed or gains shilds and once per battle
did people forget bailu exists
this doesnt even seem as op as people are making it out to be reviving with one hp is not a game changer as you can still be killed again if the enemies still have a turn
i love cas
it is definitely a broken passive but i dont agree that its a force you to pull move your phrase to make endgame content easier itself says so it just makes it much easier could you still clear endgame without it yes do you need her specifically to clear end game no is it absolutely impossible to clear end game without her no this itself makes her not a must pull theyre definitely very strongly trying to make you spend on her but you could still complete the game without her
oh no not the the people doomposting the game weve had this conversation since the beginning of time the people that want to quit will quit the people that wan to play will play in the end no one give a damn and just move on as per usual
honestly as someone who is dying a lot in hsr i need this to boost my account i dont care what anyone says i have been dying this is a blessing to me
even if this one is lore accurate that is not a good enough reason if we had lore accurate anything else in this game everything would be messed up lore accurate acheron would oneshot anything she gets to hit on principle saying its lore accurate is very much bullshit there is a whole lot of characters who would not be playable if it was lore accurate because in lore they cant fight
if had just stayed when she was in the team only id be ok with it we have characters like gepard and bailu that do something similar but it gets too much when not even on the team
shes basically non healer bailu
wellwait for the difficulty spikethen the casuals will barkwith this passive in mindeverything will go hardereven story quest will be harder to beatnot just the endgame contentand when things get hardthe release new character with new global passive to just ease the difficultyand rinse repeat profit
i will say this who ever bitching about dying in hsr pls play something else this game is not for you
waiting for a male character to get a passive so that both parties can feel what it is like to get a global passive on someone they dont want
i mean yea im all for lore accurate power then when do we get welt to oneshot everything when he ults uknow when he unleashes a mfking black hole
the entire reason why bailu was needed in early content was because she could revive a dead teammate once the only difference is that castorise revives at hp and that she doesnt have to be on the team
i like it idc about ppl complaining
omg they said they want future characters to be more lore accurate but now
i think the global part of her passive wouldnt be too much of an issue if was just in sudu andor while youre on the planet of amphoreus i feel like making it active in mocpfapoc is the real issue that hoyo added
global passive basically makes it so that you have more than characters like imagine if we get more characters with that plus bailu youd get free revives times in a single battle
wha that is a unique skill
bailu cant revive you just by being on your accout though can she there is literally comparison to be made here
the passive is only broken if youre not using a veteran account most people have the right sustains to breeze through moc apoc and sustainless runs in pure fiction are the way to go anyway its useless for me ig
this is a terrible mindset anyone who turns a blind eye to what this means for the future of the game will be on their knees pleading with tears rolling down their face when daddy hoyo adds res pen def shred account wide stat boosts as global passives then scales the endgame boss hp with the assumption in mind that players have access to all of them players who dont want those specific characters get a big fat fuck you and have to end up eating shit ill keep playing but im getting my ass out straight away if they pull some shit like that
bepo this is a great time to move out theyll pull the shit regardless
take the quote marks out when describing the global passives as shit we all know its garbage and terrible for the game especially for low spenders or fp players who get cucked massively by it the majority of players arent whales
skill issue
this is blessing passion for me ive been dying a lot crazy it not my fault that i keep dying i really this character to boost my account it really handful passion that boost my account very well
zd it absolutely is your fault if you keep dying unless youre a newer player without the knowledge and ability to properly build your units to have max potential literally just pick any star sustain or an e gallagher and you wipe the floor with this games engame
honestly it isnt my fault it the the enemies that is super hard stress ful dude you dont when you go up against the bosses they have extra stats not many people have the same resource the game has been super hard the enemies exploration of higher world my team isnt fit that without the global passive skill i need it as a player who keeps dying in hsr we need this global passive skill for end game
zd its okay if you need her then just pull her dont listen to those butthead youre the only one who knows your best team comp but this global passive only revive with hp so u still need a healer to heal them
aventurine would increase my luck when summoning blade would be unkillable kafka could mind control the moc boss and order it to unalive itself lore accurate character kits would kill this game
im pretty sure phainon has one cant wait for all the waifu players to bitch about it
bepo fr i cant wait to see the reactions
im sure youll like it when the male character you dont want comes with a res pen global passive
im a meta slave if i have to pull to get that i will im only here to reach big pp dmg dw
one simple thing if u complain so much abt then skip it then no one is forcing u to must pull just bc everyone think its a must pull character _ just pull if u like her or dont pull if u dont like her thats it _
as long as more global passives are added i dont give a crap what they do
the only issue with this is that theyll make something better however the bar is incredibly low right now as this passive isnt even as good as people are making it seem as yeah you revive okay but its at hp so the chances of you instantly dying again is pretty high alongside if you are dying a whole bunch where this actually matters in endgame content to begin with then thats just a skill issue
players are afraid that in the future they will have to be forced to pool characters with buffs that are too powerful but in reality with the unique cone and edelon system hoyo can very well force a character to have edelon to be useful or something else or even force more no need for global and for me it helps the challenges with a small number of characters
i still skip her also yes hsr became a pw game because of the huge powercreep
damn they milking us so much
the problem is just that it woeks when shes not even on the team if it was just something that happened while she was on the team like bailu there wouldnt be a problem
lore accurate dont cry ok dont come crawling back when the game is unplayable because of powercreep
so whats the difference with fuxuans havent been playing since the release of penacony
honestly with mydei being immortal its already cracked soloing simulated universe with him
skipping her for anaxa dont want that global passive non sense shit
so if i made a character that is overpowered and tell everyone that its accurate cuz lore its fine
castorices global passive is unfair what about mydei do you think its fair that he is immortal is that what were thinking now
just dont die
cry for those people who have gamble addiction i already have k jades castorice and for her lc
i dont care
that should have kept into the storyline only battle ability not your grinding time battle like a special assist ability for the final boss robot dan heng and robin with astral express it makes sense because final boss is hard to win and you need it to even the plain field
this game is gone the actual downfall from is crazy
at first i didnt wanted to pull for her because i dont like the character no hate please thats only my point of view but since her capacities are broken i dont have the choice to pull for her
i just hate that kind of feature so i will simply skip castorice
wow now think of the things you could do if you put that time into making your real life productive loser
meanwhile you can solo woth acheron cause she negates battles all together but yeah i need another scythe welding butterfly girlie also no one can force you to buy anythingyall lack self control and it shows
yall forgetting that bailu can do that too and it heals more then hp so dont cry about it
no its stupid i dont give a shit about lore reasons this is gameplay and its broken
i love cas but this is something that shouldnt exist
tbh idc i see this as a win i bet ppl who complain prob jus dun have enuf jade for castorice nvr spend any money on hsr and still got character i liked so jus enjoy it
no one forcing anyone to spend money to get her though calling the game paytowin ignores the fact that success is still achievable without spending money some players are still clearing end game content with star characters but i understand where players are coming from i wasnt planning on pulling for her but this global passive leaning me towards pulling for her
i mean to be honest i didnt realise care about her kit i kinda tuned out when they were talking about it i just got excited shes on screen ive been saving for her when i saw her teaser
theyre only healed for hp bruh and people calling that broken bailu literally has her own revive too and werent people just complaining about endgame being super hard with all the hp inflation now that they release a character thats strong enough to help players with endgame people see it as too much honestly i love castorice since i couldnt even clear moc this time despite clearing moc for legit almost every patch
it would be good if they make for every character a passiv for example if u habe bailu u gain effect res for vidhyadria race or something else or bronya passiv would be inspire the silvermane guide increase speed for gepard bronya etc something like that
every star should retroactively get a global passive
the passive itself is the problem not what it does the revive is fine but it opens a door to more stuff and i dont want a future character to just give a crit body to everybody on the account or something like that
err whats the problem about this global passive actually her global passive isnt even the problem we could still clear moc with star just get a good sustain like lingshahuohuo or aventurine heck even fu xuan can do im still using her since i dont have aventurine bruh isnt this her global passive is actually good i mean for those ppl with skill issue like those guys complaining about her passive
criaram um boss pra temos que pegar ela
honestly just so people get even more pissed off i hope they make these global passives more broken in the future cause at least ill benefit
objectively weak passive that is not a revive since it is lore accurateit just delay death and you need a shield or heal on the character for him to be ressed
ah the its lore accurate people next time hoyo will do entire modes and rewards locked behind characters and people will support it maybe even an entire game you have to roll a character before being able to play
i wonder how short sighted you gotta be to be a white knight not just in hoyos game but in every gacha community like do you not see how detrimental passives like these are down the line when the flod gates open these people defending the game will be the first to call it pw trash when the kettle boils too hard it happened in other gachas itll happen here too
i dislike the fact that teammates can still be revived wo her on the team it just doesnt really make sense im only really getting her tho bc of her beautiful animations not due to her kit or play style lmao
so what this game is not multiplayer i can play anything i want
revive but in hp take it or leave it
she doesnt negate nikador in moc
yeah because bailu and also one of fu xuans eidolons and gepard and e arlan can do it to the whole team and while not even being in the said team its sarcasm btw its not the revive part of global revive passive that people are upset by its global as in you get it by getting a character on your account nobody would as much as bat an eye if she revived people on her team
youll keep the same energy when they add a res pen global passive to the male character you dont want right
to create more fomo and fuck over fp players even more idk about that one
bro the people who need the passive have skill issue not the other way around people complaining about it dont need it its just not a good look for the future if they intend to add mkre
no really and we thought this company thats always been greedy and was actually changing its all lie its basically like what they say about the devil no shoot they greedy
way too broken and not healthy
i dont see the pay win problem if you grind you can get her for free those are just excuse of weak and lazy player
then in next patches enemy will lock everyone in your team and then they will introduce new character with full immunity lmao its always like this after version update your character even in e will be useless af
it will only get worse from here
those people are just baliu mains crying for no reason lol
the community is definitely cooked people are defending this clear cash grab those that dont understand this is just the beginning of more broken mechanics are shortsighted and possibly ignorant of cause and effect
how is a free revive a bad thing
if shes on the team then its okay if shes not even in the team it just doesnt make sense youd just be getting her to put in your inventory
global passive will erase all enemy turns and give crit rate and crit dmg
this is cool and her kit seems just fine
shills and bootlickers will defend anything mhy know their players are stupid
they couldve given her free if thats the case
i literally see no issues with this her revive isnt even that big hp and youre probably gonna die right after and its only really good for newer players because if youre already good at the game and have some built stars you shouldnt even be dying anyways
hoyo since hird always do stupids thing like this
i mean no one is forced to pull for her
i think it wouldve made more sense if other parts of her kit are not as strong making castorice an introduction to global buffs only but since shes very strong and the only character with global buffs she easily makes the game even more unbalanced
people complain the character who is not released yet
really hate it when people completely miss the point of hating on global passives castorices specific passive is something but just useless by itself the fact that it simply exists and is being allowed to exist means that not only would hoyo continue making characters with slowly more and more powerful passives but other gachas that copy hoyo would too
if only it was passive if she was on the team it would have been a great way to use the idea of passives to revamp old characters to have their own and maybe make them better but instead its a global passive
skill issue for those who pulled for every character in penacony to amphoreus seriously this game aint pokemon getting characters are optional and you can still get them in their rerun
gepard but for all
welp i have acheron on my main but i will get her in my alt fp btw
i think that people just fear change if they hate this passive then they can just completly delete bailu at that point too
i dont want this to happen cause it might happen to the games i play
they both right thats cool and all for like a endgame character in a regular game like persona but with a gacha game this is unfair to those who dont want her or just dont have the resources feels like a slap in the face ngl
westerners being karens on gaccha games doesnt surprise me its simply a game and for entertainment if you dont want her dont get her you dont have to fucking complain online _
i think that turn based game from hoyoverse was a mistake xd
people are gonna be pulling for these characters and keeping them at lvl
actually this global passive is not broken its nothing tbh like you are reviving yourself with hp once we are at the point where we are facing enemies at once you revive yourself with hp only to perma die in next hit stop shitting yourself over a passive that is not even broken only because it works without castorice in team in fact it will only help new players that have problems with story
pulling for castorice for her passive to do zero cycle
once i heard of this i lost my day streak and just quit
strategy game is not so strategy in a nutshell
as long as the enemies does not scale up in power due to her passive coz that still raises the bar for existing characters besides there are too much variables in play when fighting now compared to before it can change the outcome but not all if you still cant beat the enemy before it defeats you
uhh its kinda like barbs c no
im with this
in my opinion the easy way to make everyone happy is to make her free to get via an event while making her r use the revive ability more than once
the f it can be disabled anyway
ok for me not every time i need to revive a character
do you think hp can do anything unless they make it go frist after revive
thats the one think i kinda hope for if they go all out in terms of bad idea and add global passive that help dish out more damage i at least hope they will have the idea to not take said passive into account when making the stats of future monsters otherwise yeah
this is a valid complaint this sum rezero bullshit
if u dont like dont pull common sense people
only broke players will cry becay of this
doesnt matter to me i just play to enjoy not to compete
listen im a whale not e everyone whale but eses most characters whale with an occassional e for the fav waifus typically eish for first banner then e on rerun my opinion on castorices gp its shit straight up if youre dying enough to need revives in this game you either have shit team builds major skill issues a fp that still hasnt used a majority of their pulls and is just running a bare minimum passing team or an autoplayer hsr is barely a difficult game and if you do end up dying cause of a skill issue you can easily just restart the fight all castorices gp does is save a bit of grinding time for the hp sponges for less well off accounts i dont have the best luck warp tracker says im top on pulls but im bottom on rate up luck and my relic luck is just as bad but i dont ever have anyone die unless im running auto if i have a skill issue cause im being stupid i just restart this gp is literally a nothing burger now do i think global passives are a good thing fuck no ive played tons of gacha games and the thing i hate most is fomo pw bs depending on what hyv does with gps it can go two ways they keep them as gimmickyvery very tiny buffs that wont change shitthink the room decorations for du that give x stat or whateveruseless most of the time abilities like castorice or they go balls to the wall with fomo pw ass buffs and kill off the majority of their playerbase that dont want any of that given the track record of hyv i do have a feeling theyll realize the backlash of having too op of gps so they wont go balls deep but majority of people sayong castorices gp is absolutely game breaking or whatever the fuck need to chill tldr revive mechanics in hsr is absolutely useless even in endgame content unless youre fp or have major skill issues i hope gp stays this useless but yall overreacting little babies
gacha players mad about pw and powercreep
hoyo kids will support ofc
whose gonna tell them that the gacha game is already pay to win
unique my ass
i also have something weird to share the herta is not in my team but i have her right now but the basic treasures are still marked in the map i dont know if this is set on purpose or if it is a bug
i love castorice and i am so gonna es but the idea of global passives is a horrible idea people who like castorice are gonna be nah this is fine but if a character they dont wanna pull has an insane global passive that like idk increases every members crit rate by then what are you gonna do thats a mustpull cuz if you dont you have a massive disadvantage vs people who pulled the character its different from having someone like robin because shes just character that needs to be in a party but getting huge passives for just owning a character is ridiculous
that its a tactic by hoyo to boost revenue everything has been a tactic to boost revenue you dolts youre realizing this shit just now
i think majority of the community agrees it should not be active even while shes off the team its most definitely a ploy
as a casual fp player who only play star rail for the story this doesnt affect me
wait i thought all hoyo games were always pay to win
yall can keep the drama i just want a cute purple girl with a pet dragon
im personally just going to cross my fingers and not freak out yet its a slippery slope for sure but the stone hasnt started rolling yet as castorices passive itself isnt anything crazy for the time being im not going to worry about it and just keep having fun
i dont really mind but if you combine bailu and castorice together in the same team then ya thats pretty broken but useful if you dont want your main or sub dps to die
lets clarify why are we so worried about castorices global passive it open hells gate for even more powercreep the game allways plays around newer chars on its full potencial so what if it becomes a must have in future to even be able to complete end game content castorice will not be the only one with this kind of passive in the future we could start to see passives way more op than that like a healing every turn extra sp every turn permanent stat boosts or all characters advance action after each turn it seems pretty bad and skippable but those effects will stack so you will have sp healing and action advance passively every single turn without even having the characters in your party there is no such thing as exclusive to x character summons were exclusive to jim yuang elemental weakness forcing was exclusive to silver wolf different kind of ult charge was exclusive to acheron think about it
cant wait for phainon and cyrene to have even more broken global passives as a result truly the honkai star rail experience
true it seems like everyone continuously forgets that hoyo hires actual psychologists to force people to top up more
the thing is that because of powercreep farming pulling currency is going to get more difficult which in turn makes getting your loved characters more difficult while staying fp
prmtechnic isnt that only for newer characters i aint pulling for the most recent i am only farming for the older characters because i like them plus i aint grinding for endgame content just the story otherwise i wouldnt have played endgame enemies will naturally just be stronger than the storys
why do people get so grumpy over a game character you can still play the game it will just be harder
people support because of lore bro she can have the skill but just dont make it global passive
i mean it is revive but at only hp enemies with frequent attacks or aoe attack will deal with it no problem
a good way to balance this is to give it a chance to not work if shes not in the team this would force people to not rely on her but still come in handy if worst comes to worst
i dont know about that just hope you dont get hit after you revive
the passive itself is not that op but can you imagine the future characters who will have much more op global passives this will only make this game more pw as if the hp inflation wasnt enough
why are people complaining its not like hsr has pvp like damn just play the game
why i dont care end game content may be hard for characters to clear and this passive does inspire fmo but like its more if you want her get her if you dont then dont you dont need to be a meta slave i still use jingliu blade for content so its just like why the hell would i care for meta i just want her cause she has a scythe and shes a cool character not meta reasons
they better buff the passive global because hp is boring
synergistic characterbound interactive passives that makes unique and interesting team customisation is good but global passives that grants stat sticks that are monotonous and territorial for having a character is moronic and unintuitive
lore accurate with the authority of death what about the players who dont want to pull her castorice lore and design was good enough without them rewarding the waifu gooners
this really feels like a nothing burger to me people just want to complain even though theyre still gonna pull for these units and some of them are still gonna spend on monthly pass and battle passes while complaining about whale bait the revive doesnt seem all too amazing cause if you could die once you can die again and even if they did more world passives thats just an extra boon you get for pulling that character people are acting like this will make the devs consider making a world passive thats a one time boss one shot or something
serious its only time activate and also hp per battle for me its not broken at all even the passive activates as long as the mobs turn its still useless as f
with this and the whole va situation im kinda surprised more people havent reached the same obvious solution i came to if you dont support the actions that hoyo is taking then the simplest and most effective solution that you can do as an average player is to quit playing hoyo games i enjoy hsr and between it and genshin ive spent over k but ive quit every hoyo game due to the direction that the company is taking their games
oh no big company wants big money what else is new
bailu is literally the same thing
oh boo ho you dont need to pull her
me fully fp been saving for her and for clearing my end game content see this as an absolute win
i just need dps to clear as fast possible the only problem with harder content really haha
as long its first and last global passive every is fine
basically bailu
the problem isnt that its broken its that they are going to add more shit like this in the future
if she gets a global passive than phainon and cyrene should get theirs too atk hp aspd buff when theyre in your account
i decided to quit honkai star rail hoyo wanted to boost their sales sike people are leaving instead the favortism towards the female characters is too much they even had the nerve to nerf anaxaim done i wont be playing any hoyo games in the future
its amazing how shortsighted some people are defending this and how this global passive can potentially ruin the game and the gacha space in general its better to hold on to those what ifs than being an i told you so moment in the future
with this i expect future boss to shot even with shields
lmao calling it as a cash grab but it is your own responsibility to be spending tbh i think it is unique mechanic in a turn based games like this it is not that powerful than what people think she can revive a charcater with hp which unless its your healers turn there is still risk especially facing with aoe attack enemies but the most concerning for this unique passive is the global stats buff for future characters i hope it is not that absurb that affects hsr overall gameplay
the one thing im just worried is if the end game is gonna be where you need her i can see them make an enemy where it was kill one party member of their break bar isnt broken i can see some scummy plays they will pull
theyll start seeing a problem once a character comes out that they do not want but have to pull because passive is just that good and makes your account weaker otherwise
its passive just bailu with extra spice
why everybody never think it through before judging hoyo is a multi million dollar company they aint gonna do shits like adding out of the universes global passive like people expect to and ruin their own artwork
people complain with everything lol no ones forcing them to get her
they could of just had a cool dying effect when shes on the team but no they had to do some insane bullshit like revive everyone all the time everywhere
i dont think her appearance makes this game a pay to win people love to exaggerate things too much shes not a must to have unit if u dont want her just pull for whoever u like its not that deep u love waifus then pull for waifus u love husbandos then pull for husbandos
it is not that it is broken this ability is never broken as in my opinion instead of wanting a revive mechanic how about not dying in the first place the real issue isnt the her global passive alone it is the implication in the future what if hoyo makes even more absurd and op global passive so until they either scrap this idea and remove it not doing this again or balance it so that it is not stupidly op this will be an issue for the future so for now we just have to wait and see
its not the deep lets be so fr right now
yeah yeah castorice being tied to death while theres two emanators currently playable which is closest to omnipotence
watch when the fate collab characters will have global passives if you dont get them its actual permanent account damage
i think if castorice has one future characters will have some other global passives to make it a bit more integrated so im not gonna be that surprised if people complain when another comes out with a global passive also this game is not multiplayer and you aint fighting each other if someone flexes they have castorice and they got saved by a sick revive then like i dont think it should matter as if you just play the game you dont need that much stuff to get to the main story especially if you dont care and are here for characters and lore then theres even an easy mode that changes the big fights people might struggle with
how can people be so stupid
cant wait till hoyo sells entire modes or entire games locked behind a character because its lore accurate
jetkirby and watch revenue shills say genshin and hsr are better coz they earn more
do you need new chars for new story quest
i just wanna ask a question why not wait until this happen then there would be reason for anger castorices global passive is useless because the characters might die even after the revive theres no other additional effects other than the revive the revive is probably there because it connects to the whole kit of her taking away lots of allies hp if the devs make another character with a global assive they have to nerf something big from that character either way it might just be uniquely only for castorice like some other stars having their own unique thing even though global passives are pretty bad theres no proof that there would be any more of these in the future its just a possibility or a what ifs that hasnt been proven yet not even by early access players since thats a future we havent seen yet we can still say to the devs that future global assives will be bad for the game instead of saying that they dont listen and go on a rage or something if the future global passives does happen then the devs not listening would be justified why not cross that bridge when we get to it im not trying to make you mad im just wondering why not wait because the i told you so moment in the future is not really that concrete yet
anonyshark because waiting and being okay with these types of features is already a form of consent by the time the i told you so moment happens its already too late and these devs wouldve already created multiple global passives in the pipeline and thats the exact shortsightedness i was referring to you said it yourself even though global passives are pretty bad letting them get away with one is contradicting your own statement and a clear sign that youre giving them consent to create more
jamesnieves not unless someone does something about it with the amount of hate to global passives the ones who favor it or those that are okay with it will be overshadowed by people who dont like these assives since theres alot of us myself included im saying theres no guarantee for the devs to make more global passives if theres alot of people hating on it others can just put on surveys or on comments on the app that future global passives shouldnt be added in the future that would hopefully make the devs listen we should take action first before doing something too far like drama stuff sorry for misinterpreting that im okay with global passives because im not okay with it as well your point with it already being too late is true i shouldve thought of it before i just hope there arent game changing global passives in the future
telling hoyo to stop their powercreep has never been a winning argument
anonyshark if only the devs read the survey carefully
jamesnieves her passive does not break anything if you died once youll just die again you still have to be strong enough you can just surpass rng to a certain degree the real problem is it opens the gate for future characters to have also global passives that will give everyone crit dmg or like rsistancewich yes that would probably break the game
nukecase can you at least try reading the rest of the thread you just repeated what ive already mentioned lol
lacking immaturity perhaps this is a single player game there is no competitivity people who complain are incredibly dumb the coop part is optional and it does not affect the endgame content in any way so why the hell should people not be defending it are people gonna complain about elden ring having good scaling weapon and bad scaling weapons the fact people spend money or not is not relevant you can get castorice without money stop being immature
itd be find if this game wasnt gacha like a story progression where shell join your team after you unlock her and then can choose for her to be on your team the problem is mixing global passives with a gacha game
so bailu is now a totaly useless character i mean revive was her only saving grace and it wasnt even enough
a must pull but not necessary enough to splurge too much it could make things easier but not impossible
they couldve just make it team wide and the complaints would stop cas is a highly popular and loved character so i assumed many people would pull for her i dont know the reason why they need to make it global
remember people like this will always say no this is just chinese propaganda they just want you to spend all your money no they dont force you to spend any money in fact you can play these games without spending a dime but for some reason so many people just want to say oh no you have to spend money because theyre forcing you theyre not
just make it so she has to be in the party literally thats all it would take
nobody cares about castorice revive people care about it being global if it would be in her kit while shes on the team nobody would care but it being global opens the door for future charackters and fomo imagine how hsr is in years when you dident get chars that have a global passiv like critrate or spd boost the powercreep is real if irc right the current base speed of trash monster is and they have x the base hp of monsters from the lofou ohh or imagine smth like a passiv that increases the loot you get from resinbased content global passivs hurts the game and anyone who denys it is someone who doesent care or doesent think longterm if anyone here thinks its good pls give me valid arguments for it cuz i cant see any unless you pay each month to get every char
must have yeah totally its not like you are the one pulling or anything
people arent mad that the castorice ability is overpowered they are mad because this means it wont take long for a character like cyrene for example just giving your characters true damage while not on the team
i understand where people are coming from but really now do people still die in this game with our current selection of preservation units and healers you wont even die in this game so i dont think castorices passive is that much of a big deal
the community its always going to find something to complain about
when was this game or other hoyo games not pw
this will only be helpful to those that dont have a c aventurine making their team nearly unkillable
i dont see anyone complaining when previous meta like acheron released so why now
you should be able to get global buffs with in game currency
hoyo simps real smart when they say castorice lore accurate shes the symbolism of death and not rebirth deadass
im already burned out on hsr as is i dont need another reason i need mydei and anaxa for my husbando collection
castorice glazers are the weakest link i wouldnt want this thing anywhere near my account what an insult
got one shot in divergent oh no oh wait i have revive from castorice still nikador turn proceed to get one shot again
okay im fine with her reviving team mates when shes on the team makes sense but frickin outside the team what the actual frick
many rpg games has that one character what is wrong with you people
oh okay so just keep her at lvl
before i say anything imma just say we as a community are kinda fucking stupid we complain we beg hoyo for shit then when they do it or they do something healthy we keep bitching abt it acheron is too strong jiaoqiu is ass firefly is garbage now after the v nerf blah blah blah back around i thought it was kinda insane how much hoyo was freeballing it and now i realized why were too fucking unorganized every time the community has a good opinion another part shuts it down or just doesnt fully have an idea powercreep is rampant in hsr the powercreep is bad like yeah but what about other games ive played arknights ive played crk and all the other mobile gachas and tbh their powercreep is worst this powercreep will kill the game yeah but how the fuck are they supposed to fix that hoyo you racist how tou going to fix this shot you taken from a real review on the hsr review page on the apple store btw it was star xd as it would probably be said a lot of people complain but with those complaints dont give valid feedback on how to fix it just more screaming now while i play devils advocate there are good reviews i like this game but i wish that the content was easier while powercreep is good i wished it was not this powercreep this type of game design is toxic it will kill the game eventually now onto the main issue castorices global passive overall its kinda ass the passive is a lot like bailus revive but on every team as for why its the case mocs star conditions requires that a character doesnt get downed so if you have that happens your already screwed in addition since it only puts you on hp it causes dot to install kill and if healer is dead youre still screwed or sustainless its good for stuff like sustainless but even then means nothing its a qol more than anything just like acheron in the first anniversary now why is is so controversial well its a global passive which for anyone whos played games like this causes a skewing affect on the game tldr when you have something like this it boosts everything you have but in doing so has to make the endgame content harder it could easily go to other characters hoyo has had a good track record with hsr with limiting overall duplicate kits besides like clara and yunli also mydei and blade but if we have even more units like castorice with global buffs it could ruin the games difficulty and in turn fp status if we keep globals limited to limited characters and the game chooses to scale endgame on those characters then were just fucked lastly its also the fact of fp up till now nothing was required to be pulled just stuff that people wanted and what could be scrounged up to be used to star moc its still possibly with units if you dont believe me search up the star star mocs for the last couple of mocs global passives skewing the meta causes people who dont have them to pull because newer meta is impossible without them going into point different from that is that it now forces the players to have to pull to play something that puts a bad taste in peoples mouths if the game gets to a point where you cant clear something without pulling a character something that is either gate locked by currency which you have a limited amount and or is hard to obtain a lot to get or the character immediately after being obtained becomes dead once it gets to that point that is no longer playing a gacha game thats playing to give people your money in summary castorice isnt the problem its the pandoras box her kit opened in allowing global passives it opens a toxic door which could kill the game a lot like other gacha games best case is crk i loved that game before i realized how fucked up the games powercreep was months of grinding on old characters could be blitzed by a lvl super epic ancient cookie which requires to guarantee which became worst when you literally had a pvp v and they basically came out every month if the game chooses to embrace global passive its like walking on eggshells which could easily kill or flatline the game causing it to be too hard for newer players to join while bleeding its playercount what makes this worst is that the fanbase will keep complaining about it without doing shit so imma say it as a person who want this game to last longer than the weird cookie game communicate what the fuck is wrong people like i get most of the people here are kids but its not good that most reviews are just scream matches with imaginary hoyo devs which act like its good when it basically says nothing if the game dies it a mix of hoyo devs dying like the spongebob meme and a mix of us being dumbasses which enabled and allowed it im kept criticizing the game since somebody has to but either way lets see what the next year will hold but if the community dont hound the devs on this shit were fucked
im a fan of lore accuracy in games where it makes sense but gacha games are not in that list that i accept
first complaining abouts pay to win in gacha game is stupid second her revive only give hp which still hit away from death maybe could even die instantly afyer revive due to some enemies have dot damage which mean you actually cant replace the god know so important sustain unit with more support or dps or even if you already have a sustain in the team and still die then thats mean you just not ready for end game contents if your sustainer cant do their job third as much you like the characters you cant use lore accurate as an excuse for your character to be special in an argument because the heck you mean castorice lore accurate that is why she can revive while my general of godly thunder need be to on a whole life support of cancer stage to be actually playable tldr castorice global passive isnt that good gacha games run on money lore accurate is not an excuse for hoyo to sneak in more of global buff and most people that got into any gacha game after genshincovid have a stupid opinion because they are normies
i think if it goes through it should only work in amphoreous because shes the demi titan of death in amphoreous other worlds dont believe know the titans or castorice so i think it should only work in amphoreous
i dont understand its beneficial so why people complaining like you dont need to get her if you dont want her sob
no one forcing you to wish for her stop crying
castorice i activate monster reborn
i still think its a good thing to add bcs no its related to lore no u can still beat harder gamemodes with proper teams i dont see a problem if dont wanna get her dont get her if you want to get her get her
idk i never died in game so
whats the background song
breaking news bailu found dead in the streets
wild hunt
i quit hsr about months ago due to powercreep and hp sponge endgame i come across yt shorts of hsr time to time each time it reminds me that i made the right choice wtf is this lol ill never play a turn based gacha ever again
i get it but ppl making it seem op when its hp and it could literally be the enemys turn and kills him again ig it just matters how u use it ig
people that cry about the revive just suck at the game most good teams never die and castorice passive would never activate its a nice back up if things do end up going south but she isnt a you need her or your account is dead
to be honest im just pulling because i love her doesnt matter if shes broken or no because i love her characterpersonality story and design
isnt that jst what c bailu does
tbf i dont mind the passive cuz even without castorice i can still win hsr im not that heavy on moc either
why do people make it sound like this is a first hasnt genshin been doing the same thing for years you literally have characters that halve the resource you need for certain things as long as they are in the account and that was fine now they make an incombat passive that noone will ever get to see and its a problem i dont particularly care about these stuff but the double standard is wild
yall are overreacting over this its just a single revive
i think its not that op since she only gives you hp upon reviving i might be wrong though
i just remembered the dont die at me from facebook game
we have bailu guys
as a fp who really is desperate for rolls i can say waa waa to the losers who complain yes i need to get that character too but i instead put some effort into grinding the game instead
yeah i dont care whatever petty tactic theyre using i will skip her since the start of the game i only pull the characters i like and nothing will change
oh im fine if shes in the party but out of the party i dont like that and the fact that you cant turn it off since its just always there
i can see different opinions on this my personal opinion this game have been pw for a long time u need to pull specific char to clear the current end game contents easier and then the char will get powercreep patches later which is very quick n makes it hard for fp to play this game average hoyoshill reaction this is not a competitive game u can still enjoy the game even without having castorice so its fine ps people said that acheron is broken n it is too early for a char with that kit to be release during st anniv patches later she drop to t bet same thing will happen to castorice anyways the quick powercreep is why i quit i m now playing a gacha game that gives a healthier relationship so u can do whatever u want hoyo i dont care anymore
lore is such a stupid explanation theres blade who unlike mydei is actually immortal but noo
i do not intent to pull for her and this mechanic is really annoying for people who dont want her shes insanely broken and just having her buffs any team i have no doubt every single damage showcase is gonna have her reviving someone now
just dont die skill issue imagine dying in a turn based game which are for babies
castorice global passive vs hoolay we should boicott hoolay instead because castorice global passive is useless againts hoolay
honkai el nico juego donde los jugadores se quejan de un personaje roto en un juego pve
just add more global passives and people will stop complaining
why people are so worried about this just a question because i think its not kind of big problem if hsr was pvp then yeah i would understand but the game is only for one person and you play the way you want my biggest concern is not about powercreep cause it will always exist but about supporting old characters thats all just want to know what are people talking about
currently saved up pulls and i still wont pull for castorice i dont even have the bis team for her
reviving on hp isnt event a powerceep
there are characters that revive blessings in su have revive
castorices passive in theory is not really that broken especially if you know what youre doing but it does set the presedent that theyll come up with even more broken global passives hurting the game in the longterm thats what people are pissed off over and no amount of lore or bullshit will justify a blatant predatory practice like this
just pull for her bro
havent touched a hoyo game in months and its almost ironic that every time i see something about them its another reason ill never go back though i do actually like zz and i havent heard much from that game so i guess thats good
i dont see this as bad cus this only does things either does nothing at conundrum where i take fatal damage and then still die later or i just win anyway without dying thing is honkai star rail is easy enough where to you shouldnt have problems clearing content till either a you get to high conundrums in sim uni or b you dont do enough damage to kill the bugs before they multiply again and as i said earlier its not a problem in sim uni cus i still die and the whole bug problem isnt a problem anyway since its not me dying thats the problem having said this i do think its weird that its active even when she isnt on the team but again i dont think its that big of a deal for the reasons i have stated
the global passive itself isnt that broken the real problem lies in the fact that this sets a very dangerous precedent where even if youre not interested in a character you might still feel pressure to get them because simply by owning them all your roster gets a little stronger sure a global revive passive once per battle wont save you when you are completely outmatched but what if you also add increased healing to your team from a different characters global passive or debuff resistance or god forbid increased atk or increased spd what if on the other hand you just about missed on clearing endgame fights at the highest rating and having that global passive would have pushed you over the finish line
one thing that bother me about castorice is that she is like a very picky macron because i heard her build is very picky and her lightcone none of the fp lightcone works nothing for her like oh crt lightcone its fine but she doesnt really need it or oh she needs this but not the other things include
if someones units are dying a healer is a mustpull for them not castorice xd
the universal passive itself isnt as bad as everyone makes it out to be since it can only be activated once per battle and puts your characters at hp so theyll probably get killed again anyways thats not the main issue the issue is that this opens doors for global passives that will eventually power creep this one i was never for it in the first place and will not be pulling for her i just hope hoyo will not make more characters like this in the future
where the hell are the hoyoshills who said the global buff was only for beta only pretty sure they are getting their wallets ready to pull for every character with the passives now
does anyone know about c barbara no
itd be okay if it still counts as a character dying even if the passive triggers so the no characters downed moc star is the same for people who have and dont have cas
just make it so her passive only works when shes in the team people will quit the game over every little thing wont they devs need constructive criticism not just things like power creep
oh no they added a broken mechanic in my singleplayer game
i dont know i just want castorice i thought her ult is funny and unnecessarily big which made me chuckle
i think videos like this are dumb
i saw one opinion from other cc saying that this passive is bad in the meaning that if a character dies your sustain is useless
tbh the main issue is that its a global passive the effect itself is pretty trash like any other revive since it only works once per battle but it sets a precedent and if the slowly make more global passives and make them stronger than the last they would eventually have to balance the game around it forcing you to pull new characters
as someone pulling for castorice since day ohh noo anyway
wait until you guys fight that hoolay guy when its his turn
me who resets withvery death even whe i use bailu i dont see the problem
it seems to me like an interesting feature different characters have different passives and skills it would be boring if all characters were the same it makes things more interesting i dont know if ill pull for castorice but why complain about a cool feature i see these kind of complaints every time a new character is released saw them with the herta tribbie etc
i think global passives are a cool feature but i think they should be very restrictive for instance castorices passive should only activate for one character once in the battle if shes not on field but if she is on field then every character can revive once per battle instead
pretty sure they all spammed the chat when it was revealed in the livestream
its not really pay to win it just makes the game easier
i woulnt mind if the passive was not global but a on field passive if we go by lore as an excuse then lets give the herta a global passive that you insta unlock everything on the simulated universe or if you have aventurine you can never lose a slot machine if you have jade boom now your account has infinite credits see how stupid that is
i think a global passive is neat but yeah definitelt too strong without some restrictions lol for example it shpuldnt be allowed in mirrors or apocalyptic shadow or pure fiction unless she is on team other than that i am indeed afraid of the implications this could have on not only hsr but in other hoyo games in general since well a gacha game is still a gacha
cmon we all knew that castorice would be the anniversary character plus she is quite literally death at this point so let her say arise
the revive thing isnt a one off barbara can do it but she has to be in the party this is too broken working even when she is not in the party is absurd
c barb
the only problem is see with that is that no sustain teams are getting much more benefited by that than teams with sustains we already are in an meta where sustain less teams are working great and are stronger than teams with sustains in some encounters having a character that heals one character in our sustain less team while she isnt even there that would mean everyone could just play sustain less teams if everyone just plays sustain less teams hoyo will see that thinks like moc get easyer again cause everyone has suddenly more dmg in they team and so one they will inflate the hp massiv again so teams with sustain will not make the needed dmg
she just revived then those resetting your team ro redoing the fight is also power creep like come one they added something that can help you and yall still mad like everything that hoyo do yall thought it some kindo marketing strategies like i dont even play honkai but the players yall just so ungrateful look at that character she is cute and powerful even if she dont have that passive to revived character yall still pull right so yall want character that stay as strong as the other one while the enemy getting stronger yeah goodluck with that
hoyocreep
who is others
i mean bailu can do a revive too so also yeah castorice is the heir who will become the new god of death after thanatos and her whole thing is dominion over the dead its as lore accurate as you can be with one who holds power over death
of course is the most op pasive in all the gachas games revive character even if she is not in the team its literally pay to win
blade be like stop healing me 
lmao reviving does not mean you will win ask bailu enjoyers they plan for failure and rightfully so
just dont die guys duh
its actually a good thing that weirdo left the game because of this
dont even play hsr im just consuming knowledge for no reason
like can they atleast give us a way to turn it on ot off
as a guy who only cares about pulling hot men and characters she seems cool im still skipping her for the hot men
i think it should be only when castorice is on the team
if you need a revive in general you are just bad so its not a broken mechanic you just need to git gud
i mean honestly im ok with this because all of the new characters have a unique animation on their character so i get it i just dont get why it still goes on when castorice isnt there like it would have been better to not effect like a healer but im not against it either and im gonna skip her cause i want anaxa my bitch speech teacher and honestly hoyo need to make money so what was that line like are people serious at this point if you wanna make it easier it will be fine in other situations too like i get it it is hard but like myself i got at least near a yeari think maybe more to beat that bug shit roan mei made so yeah pls get what im getting at yeah
people forget this game doesnt even have leaderboards or something to make it competitive wheres the pay to win
if your characters dying you making something wrong
i love this you dont have to pull for her tbh
this is a good mechanic that fits into her lore so i think its fine
please do correct me if im wrong but doesnt bailu have a similar ability
the game has always been pay win
im pulling her not because of her passive but because she has pretty animations
i repeatto fix this they should just make the global passive obtainable even with clearing some part of the story and make the character only unlocking it without the need of that but anyway i have the sensation we will not see much other global passives after this unlike what most people say honestly its just a sensationbut until now all my sensation were right so i have high hopes
the gameplay has rules theres way too many characters who break them already and muh lore shouldnt be the excuse here with silverwolf i personally think that was as far as it shouldve gone for weakness implants and i think characters relying on break like ff deserve a certain amount of res ignore but the amount of rule ignoring in the game is too much imo
you dont have to pull everyone i didnt pull for mydei to pull for her as a fp
the problem isnt the passive its the precedence of said global abd one of said global one of the fate collab characters will have so its a scummy way to force players to pull for characters theyd initially wanted to skip
nah its not a problem
welcome to the downfall of hsr
this is why i stoped playing it sll bs now
i think people need to jumpstart an extra brain cell stop spending gems randomly and get characters they need the most
acheron should be stronger than her if it was lore accurate but unfortunately this is not the case
just lore accurate is a stupid statement to defend a literal must have pw character mydei is most definitely lorewise stronger than her since he is god of war as of now but he isnt even close to being a must have for endgame
in my opinion i think shes so cool and ive been saving since ive got the herta
im saying this here because i know for a fact at least some people will see this note this is my opinion if you disagree i dont care if you dont want the passive to affect your gameplay dont pull the character plain and simple im not pulling for her not because i dont want her i would generally love to have a chance to get a redo button without having to start the whole fight over im not pulling for her because i dont play like that ill get there at some point its just my account is not that strong yet all pulls are for fuge her light cone as well and its not even open for debate is the purple reapers passive strong yes is it game breaking absolutely fucking not if i call my host im sorry i tried to do this on a sub read and a lot of people called me a slur that is depicted towards people with autism so yea they can kiss my ass theyre blowing something up that is not even a issue
global passives can be good but this one needs a nerf since it can be activated even if shes outside the party gave bailu the middle finger hard i think it wouldve been fine if the player could choose character to make them revive and only them for the combat then sure but even if its only time per battle its basically screaming if you miss out on her the end game will be much harder on you so i hope you whaled hard on your dps
those think the god key system in hi which used to be not bad till part with god key stacks is a good way to rip people off their wallets and apply its to the rest of hoyo games good work geniuses
me its another waifu you metacreeps
people are pissed that the whole cast of the flamechasers v are no way knferior to arons even rivalkng emanators
doesnt bailu do the same thing
we shall have her and more similar support characters in the future why not
are we forgetting bailu exists she has a revive mechanic too
people dont even realize what will happen in the future blind hoyoshills i am actually not sad for them i am just dissapointed
nah she is good the she is now
i am just here to take my wife rest is extra
i already have both aventurine and huo huo and bc of the anniversary ill get luocha and on top of that i can put fu xuan in the permanent banner instead of gepard who i already have so in terms of survivability im done i actually dont need castorice revival im only pulling her just because i like her overall kit which is fucking insane and bc i like her design
i like it and it shove been added sooner
so its just a focus sash in a gacha game
sorry for what im about to say but if you let a character die in any gamemode you or your team suck ass
by lore okay silver wolf literally hacks the universe and all she does is apply a couple debuffs and add a random weakness element of wha tyou have in the party when in lore she could just delete the enemies acheron can oneshot anything by lore but in gameplay you need to apply debuffs before she can even ult which doesnt always oneshot especially with the hp inflation blade and mydei are literally immortal and they have limits in battle welt has an entire black hole and the enemies are still alive yet for cas she basically gets a death confirmation email whenever a team member dies she doesnt even need to be there tldr alot of other characters have part of their lore in gameplay but its balanced and for bailu who can revive its one character if e once a battle and shes also a healer so it makes sense then she also left the meta a long time ago
yep if she in the team then it fine but it still affect the team that without her presence that is pw
i have a guarantee and high pity already so no problem for me
make sense to its lore also anaxa doing literally only dmg ratio for a energy ult
pay win si no lo sacan es su problema
i aint ever seen a playerbase get so worked up over the meta of a singleplayer game enjoy the game how you like its not like youre griefing other people for bad balancing in ranked smh
i havent played since early x patches safe to say im pulling for her but the powercreep is the whole reason i stopped playing
getting revived once a match isnt not that big if cas is a very very special character in a special case its gonna be ok it would only be a problem if shes not and they keep doing it like a casual thing
easy save for her
dont care i am pulling her
seen the leaks future characters also have global passive one have boosting max hp of all characters
admit it your team just so weak that you have to roll castorice just for those passive what do you mean must pull character
im a new player in hsr im not going ever to spend on this game i just abuse the meta in early game and then do whatever i like for the sake of the fun when i get bored of meta
if she is in the team i can agree to itbut just because u have her u get the passive even thou u dont use her in team is bad
yup its just lore
it feels like youre triggering a c qiqi but actually without qiqi being in your current active team but your revival is just there
the powercreep in star fail is insane even compared to honkai impact wth
wait until they release character with ruan mei kits for their global passive
if you dont like this than dont play her
if you need to pull her for the revive its a skill issue
to make it simple youre pulling and building meta characters now instead of and the chance of making it is high
innovation this is gepard powercrept
anybody seeing this as a weak passive sure but this is just the st of many
sips i dont need money to get her hahah
its more so the possibility future characters are going to have these kind of mechanics an force players to get them for the passive rather than actually liking them cause being real we already have bailu an we have modes where we attempt no sustain challenges so the characters are gonna get offed any way around
even i who doesnt care about endgame sees this as a problem and a bad precedence i dont take endgame seriously but ive heard that the hpinflation is crazy the existence of global passives like this will allow bosses to become even more difficult to the point where you can only use the characters with those passives to clear it in a way forcing you to pull for them even when you dont like them im so glad i just play for the story
well saying hoyo forces them to pull they literally force you every time cus the endgames change and give buffs to the new characters and i think castorice is not pw bc hsr give so many stellar jades so everyone can farm enough pulls to get her and this passive in not locked behind cons so
aint no way they just powercrept my bailu with a non healer
ignoring the global passive it was a livestream announced which old unit gets buffs free limited unit rework storytelling issues mentioned etc
sounds like some people got a skill issue known as being broke get your bread up fam jk im just tryna aura farm like piccolo and jin woo
how is getting a free revive which by triggering it means you have skill issue a pw feature ive already had my laugh at those e fu xuan havers for even wanting an e fu xuan again having a global passive feature is alarming but castorices passive itself isnt its a thing that lures those noobs in or for skill issue ones if youre an experienced player youre literally getting a useless global passive
so it works once u get back with low hp is that it
i think the its because of the lore is the biggest meatrider sentence ever
im kinda down the middle its not as good as bailus in raw numbers but the fact it can activate without her being on the team is a little concerning
even when not in the team is just absurd
can yall shut up im trying to enjoying the game like yall acting like you have to get her you dont
still pulling i wont cry bout one or two broken buffs let them do it at least its better than genshin can offer at the end of the day its just a game for god sake complaining over something based on just a game is nuts
bg ad igtt kah
i understand the complaints for this mechanic and for the games future but at least theyre giving her away so for now i think its fine
yall miss the point even if castorice global passive is not that boosted hoyo might add more boosted global passives in future
we want strong unique characters no not like that
wait till hoyo balance endgame content around global passive in mind
its unique plus you cant spam the passive some people and cc just want to complain about anything even when its unnecessary
the main reason im with hoyo on this one is that the hrs community is the fact that they wil flip flop any time hoyo release anything character too storng complain too weak complain character is balanced complain like i can see why the devs dont listen and also the fact that people are getting angry from somethingn that is first optional and second inevitable cuz hsr is a turn base game alot of people can onlt play that like min till they get bored so of course they are gona do do smt to engage the audience
well in my opinion its not that good like other character like bailu also haves a reanimation but that not makes bailu a meta character castorice is the same her reanimation its not that good and its not that common to lose a character if you have good builded supports even in difficult end game
aelia so whats the point of complaining if you can still clear story content
nah imo the livestream was still ass pretty much the same but i guess a new system for whales and a free new star it doesnt feel like an anniversary patch
piie they are buffing old units and giving free units that anniversary worth patch
piie your probably a whale so it make sense
piie did u even watch the stream bro hsr always had events per patch it has been consistent so far but we can keep giving feedback and hope they listen to us they have proved us that they pay attention to feedback
bottom of the barrel rewards luocha is irrelevant ruan mei is a niche with better alternatives pulls is nothing compared to how many banners they are rerunning buffs dont count because they mentioned buffing old characters in last update they just gave the names of the characters that will be buffed after months bet even in they will say that have only buffed the skill damage and the next rework is coming in mentioning good thing
riyozsu how many like you pull everyone buddy then yeah i guess is not worth at all to you
i wish we knew how the older units are gonna be buffed because if all their do is upping the scaling the newer units will still deal times more dmg making the buffs inherently useless
riyozsu ypu literally get pulls just for logging in and of course theyre gonns do big banner events its the fucking anniversary
oneplay oh yeah a healer that people use less than gallegher and ruan mei who most people already have lol
are you talking about luocha yeah no on release day at lot of people think he wasnt good until later people found him to be op and if you deadass thinking gallegher is better luocha then you need to uninstall your game lmfao
oneplay name one team where you would pick luocha for sustain over aventurine or fu xuan or huo huo or lingsha and gallagher luocha does nothing other than sustain meanwhile the rest of the sustain provides other utils which is why they are so good huo huo gives atk er fu xuan gives cr aventurine gives cdm and debuffs and he is highly sp positive and soon hyacine can burn hp perfect for mydei and castorice lingsha is basically a break dps with added break dmg taken and gallegher can also apply debuff with higher break dmg taken by enemies
indian_gae_boii e rm is nice to have not everyone has e rm u kniw
not really a good livestream pulls was expected they cant give less than last year they had to give stomething more they did give us free dtar which tbh the only good part of the livestream they announce they buffing old characters long time ago now they talked about it around sec and they was done for it we dont even know what the buffs are and lastly the most scammy thing they add the lcs from the characters that are in to the shop meaning the only way you can get them by buying bp how am i as a fp can get fu xuan lc without spending money
they cant make unique characters they cant make unique bosses their only solution is double the boss hp and make the previous released characters ultimate the next characters skill and the character in leaks passive
just fcking play man
op for sure lore accurate too would be balanced if shes in the team only i dont care tho ill roll for her anyways
i think its fine
so google clasroom
see i like the passive the only problem is it effects the account instead of just effecting the team shes on
with the current difficulty level which we can all agree is the root of all our problems if a character dies its a sign of a lost battle either because your team isnt quick enough to finish the fight or a sustainer cant keep up with enemies atacks reviving one character with hp will not give you a lot of advantage
my characters legit never die so the whole revive thing is absolutely pointless to me but i guess for beginners it might be a little helpful if you are in the edngame and you keep dying in battle thats a massive skill issue
i just hope that this doesnt influence other gacha games and since ive become a full time wuwa player i really dont want it on there even if the character is free
next global passive your team will use your credit card balance to attacks
so shes pay to win in a pay to win game
she is not going to be unique there are more global passive cheracter going to be
in endgame content you shouldnt die anyways
not really in genshin there is star character barbara do the exactly same things at cons eidolons in hsr when i got her c barely anythings change if ur build suck then u eventually lose anyways
the main problem is that this is the ultimate characters as long as you have him you have a huge adventage in everything you do you do t have to build it you dont have to use it you dont even have to lvl up her with this kind of design wath just stop them to send some terrible design hros with good globale passive if the game is just collectioning passive character its not about having a good team with a build that make sens its about spending bucks to have the most bustes team by just collectioning a bunch of randomn character who have passive hsr gameplay is based on building team that sinergize well with each other making stuff that affect your gameplay without having to include a character in your party is just not in the identity of this kind of game furthermore it make the game a hell to jump into after if to even grasp the end game content you need a team of good builded character passive effect character its not attractive for new player its predatory for fp and low spender and its not attractive for new player i concider this game design a complet and utter failur of mihoyo
ok so we have a button game come with auto fighting dude name mydei and now a auto life saving castorice whats next a character that auto do map explore and collect everything plus e auto do quest
i want to think this is just a lore accurate passive and not something that every character will do
uninstalled
if yall dont like it dont pull for her if yall like it pull for her whats the matter
you guys doesnt have any shield and healer characterand mad at this you guys are dumb or what
yall dont forget abt how shes the anniversary character so shes straight up just guaranteed to be op like acheronaventurine last year
try not to overreact over anything level impossible
wings try not to be surprised when the game keep fuck up everything slowly
what do you have to say for the next characters in beta that have global passives too have you seen phainons kit
first of all yes i have and second of all atp just cope
rd_kaisel yall are weak
betuloz and yall are pathetic if youre raging over a singleplayer gacha game
rd_kaisel the people who complains wants the best for the game people who defends it are either sheep or just shoe lickers of hoyo youre pathetic for letting developers take advantage of you wont be surprise if u defend genshin as well
you sure people who complain really want the best for the game people who truly want the best would take the time to contact hoyo and not review bomb them on every platform wouldnt surprise me if you were in that second category
and what if i am cheap all i want to do is play the game and nothing else
rd_kaisel funny enough hoyo only responds when you review bomb and stir up enough drama their feedback functions they chose to ignore to this day in things they dont like to change this is since the very early days of genshin
littleswansplaygrownd the whole anniversary drama lmao
rd_kaisel do you actually think mihoyo would actually gaf if players protested peacefully
well do they gaf rn as the players are protesting not peacefully no exactly
rd_kaisel they will lmao do you forget the whole genshin anniversary thing they actually listened the players once you are so full of yourself
just wait for elysia version in this game but for castorice they are just crying for me its lore accurate passive and she is not must have character for me it
unique inovation limbus company did it first
i think people forgot every single character makes endgame content easier
you dont have to pull its optional
the passive itself is actually not that good its moreso the precedent it sets as well as the potential for future passives to be broken that id the real problem also fuck they mean lore accurate acheron and therta are emenators but they dont have something like that acheron is the emenator of ix which is pretty much the embodiment of death in the universe yet she doesnt have any similar abilities by that same logic both mydei and blade should literally be impossible to kill since they are immortal
because i skipped midei and tribbie i have enough to lose a and get castorice i mean i dont have to spend any coin in this game i dont see the paywin here
people are just babys
as a half fp i dont see much powercreep for this ability i dont die much or die at all this ability is useless but if in the future where it going be buff like crit damage or rate it definitely will be a problem as it will be meta but same time it player who kept pulling for every new character have this issue i personally dont have it and still rich with jades
alao me with no healers on the team
people complaining its pw me who was saving for the past two patches
no offense to anyone not even twitter who are clowns themselves but the unique thing i hear is yap yap yap and a lot of crying why take that personally a passive the point of a character is what can add to your team to make it stronger this shit is literally normal on every gacha and is not like this was the first time acheron and a lot of characters got already good passives who make your team strong enough or other stuffs just stop crying or say but bro what about the future idc the future dawg all are crying for stuffs who didnt even happened already like if is the fucking end of the world jeez
it makes sense when shes in the party but why the hell does it activate when shes not
useless passive
if they remove the global its fine but it activating without her in the team is too much imagine if sparkles sp cap increase was global
i thought a standard character already does that
mydei infinite res castorice death god rez global madge madge madge
lore fits her and her power because they made it soo
typical hoyoverseand the bumbass hoyoshills
bladie my disappoint is immeasurable and my day is ruined
i spit and vomit on anyone defending this disgusting mechanic
sputnik_man imagine getting killed by castorice after traveling and her butterflies revives you at that point just walk into the sun man
e bailu in the team and castorice in you account youll have to suffer for another day
meanwhile bailu
dont cry little hsr fan uncle hoyoverse got enough powercreep to make you pull every upcoming character for the rest your entire life hey dawei get in the new predatory mechanics the boys hungry
i have bailu and she can revive too unit per game i know castorice no need to be in team but when bailu revive give like hp but event with it you can easily die thats hp from castorice is bad your unit still die turn later so castorice revive is bad in my opinion
its a bullshit mechanic its supposed to be challenging and rewarding to clear the harder content in the game now the game has an absurd cheat like mechanic that doesnt even require that character in the team endgame content might as well be called casual content
there are unironically people who think this is not a cause for concern ever heard of the boiling frog metaphor
if this is the way to introduce global pasive they did it wrong theyve should start with a character that let you skip the history never to less still a scummy practice
wild hunt
my question is why can she revive people when her power is to cause death to anyone she touches someone pls explain
i mean i was gonna pull for castorice anyway so ill just enjoy that bonus
glad i quit the power creep was obvious months ago and i got sick of hoyo giving special treatment to some characters while making others crap rip jiaoqiu
seems weird if it works even when shes not on the team should work like bailus revive no and how come kiana and seele dont have this ability when they also have the authority of death mihoyo its so pesky when kiana gets kod in the middle of a combo especially in the herrscher trio team and then their joint techniques no longer work because theyre all on her skill page
pay to win jokes on you im into that shit
this can work on the condition of her needin to be on the team makes the ability work havin it happen without her bein in the team doesnt make any sense its just breaks the concept of the strategy part of this turn based game i bet if they had it where it only happens when she is on the team then thered be less issues
bro no one is forcing anyone to anything
the argument that it alligns with her lore is so easily invalidated just make it a passive while she is on the battlefield that would be totally fine also i dont think the ability in itself is currently a problem in a vacuum it becomes a problem once they start designing content with that in mind but the way bigger problem is the premise of global effects on characters even when they are not in the team iirc according to leaks a group of characters will have those kinds of abilities but with stat boosts instead and i think these depending on the stat are way better than castorias
bailu has been my only healer since and has had free revive since the start she boosts max hp and reduced damage taken when allies have regen on sodont think im trading her in yet
we are not this games targeted market cn loves pay for power so unfortunately en is only crying love lore big lore nut here and all but damn you cant excuse this for lore significance and im a dolphin who is going to pull for es castorice and im still extremely unhappy with this choice en need to understand they really dont care about our options saddly
turn based games is literally one of the most powercreep prone genre in gacha and yet some people still wanna support this havent yall learn from silverwolf she was so so broken on release that she literally caused the ever increasing powercreep in the game cuz they keep inflating every enemy ending with the game pumping out so many characters and supports to counteract the damage she made in the games balance lmao id love to see yall telling people to pull for a random ahh character in the future just because they give plus crit damage in youtube and twitter comments never undermine these little things even if you think the first and only current global passive is useless for you you never know hmm
honestly think ppl r complaining too much if she revives a character when not on the team then just restart the fight cuz its something u wouldve had to do either way if she wasnt on the team
just imagine if she didnt have this passive people would start to say things like uhh i would pull for her if she had something that has something to do with her lore like a revive or something yk they are just annoying
so basically bailu but better
global passives are trying to force people to pull even if you are not planning to use the character
first of all its one time so its not like its the end of the world think of almost doubling the go of one character thats it thats the passive two who cares if it breaks the meta its a story based game with zero multiplayer elements three if you complaining because it makes the game easier then so what it fomo for sure if you dont pull her but it was fomo with acheron or aventurine too four if anyone doesnt see an issue in this its kinda an issue and it kinda isnt we dont know the future of star rail so sure theres a lot of unknowns but we cant say exactly what hoyos intentions are im optimistic that hoyo will treat this like adding any other character to the game five its a global passive it works even when she isnt in the team yet again so what it all depends on how hoyo treats the game moving forward and this isnt as meta breaking as you might think six stop hating each other over this everyone is at each other over speculations that this is the end of the world and star rail is dying its not nothing has proven that just stop hating each other if you hate the game that much or you hate the addition of a global passive then quit the game if your just gonna complain that the devs hate you quit the game if you think hoyo is doing this and setting a bad precedent for the future quit the game but then again the boycott didnt work with genshin so my guess is most of you would keep playing anyways
lets see how long it takes them to add skins that provide permanent stat boosts like in all those shit mobile gachas
i wouldnt mind if it didnt work in the endgame modes
                
personally i dont really mind her global passive since im set on pulling for her regardless her design and lore really interests me and i love her dragon memosprite that she has in all honesty i dont really think her global revive will make that much of a different for the endgame content considering its just a one time revive at hp like bailu passive though that being said i can understand peoples opinion and frustration towards castorices global passive it does enable possibility for future chars to have global passives of their own that could be meta breaking but thats only a hypothetical scenario i think people are overexaggerating with mentioning powercreep and describing her as a must pull its too many what ifs scenarios and shes not even out yet on another note no one is forcing anyone to pull for her banner and they should pull for whoever they want and enjoy the game
i mean i like castorice she seems cool my issue is that it sets a standard and as weve seen with hsr will only go up from here itd be different if it just applied when she was in a team
now imagine a new character that unlocks one eidolon for the entire party but its locked behind e
lore doesnt excuse broken game mechanics despite its story hsr is still a game and needs to be balanced properly id be okay with leaving this kind of global passive if the previous characters start getting rebalanced and buffed up to match and make them relevant again and theres hope for that at least a little given hoyo has said theyre going to look into rebalancing and buffing old characters
i see wifey i click video
i think this shouldnt be put in the game at all
look me in the eyesi dont care i pull bad charchter and then not use them and i dont even pull meta you think i care if she is must have or notwell im just saying the passive is fine idc even if it doesnt exsit i dont mind i enjoy charchter
not to hate on the people who are complaining about it but if you fail to clear moc or other combat related content without a character dying youre just not doing enough damage anyways to clear it the only people that will actually benefit from this are either very new players or just people who dont farm that often
i quit and deleted the game weeks ago specifically due to her passive if hoyoverse relents and removes it and adds a skip button to story cutscenes i may return to hsr
this is my thing they get brought back with hp so if u dont heal them quick they are just gonna die again
i was going to pull for castorice but now i dont want to i like losing in fights that passive just takes the funexitement out of it for me why is it constant cant there be like a seitch to turn it on or off
i am sorry but if people are complaining about pw in a gacha game then they have never played one at all or ar ebunch of tourists considering all gacha will and do have pw aspects to them just a matter of time
im so happy i stopped playing star rail the power creep system really doesnt give you any freedom my wallet thanked me
i think its because its the firrts to have that passive later on new characters will have passive skills that could buff allies or debuff enemies but right now its because its new
lore wise but where the game will end with broken skills like this more and more meta will make the game impossible to follow being fp
dies revives at hp dies again from dot edit i might still pull on her anyway as i only just started this game as of and uhhid like to have replace qingque
i think people forgot boss enemies take two turns effect aint too strong
you must have terrible builts for characters to say she is pw you know you could revive your whole team even before castorice when pressing the reset battle button
the problem is that its locked behind a character
vergil is not broken hes lore accurate ahh moment
im sorry but its not like you have to go for her if you want her get her if you dont just dont i dont see the logic to hate her for it literally the incarnation of death ofc shed be able to do something like this is mean shouldve made sense no
starts with her passive we later get atk boost etc
if they still want it to work globally maybe atleast nerf it in endgame content where it become partywide instead but thats my opinion
idfc i pull every char and weapons for collection
i think it really only affects meta and so i cant say i care
if leaks are to be believed it was labeled as reliable but the part about it being available in abyss was labeled as questionable new genshin character escoffier is able to summon a pot that works in abyss so she can make a dish that increases atk and cd its tied to one of her passives she can only make a certain number of dishes before you have to wait days though that means youd have to get escoffier in order to make this dish to make the endgame easier so i highly doubt the global buff from castorice is gonna go away if similar things are being added to other hoyo games i kinda figured this would happen eventually
how is this a problem you pull or you dont youll be aight
doing a global passive genshins imaginarium theater hsr character i hope the powercreep in star rail doesnt start to go way more out of hand this time
idc is shes a powercreep people should be grateful and stop complaining
i meannobody is forcing them to pay
its so bad and they know what they are doing and the people who dont see anything bad youre blind
people who support this are just dumb and wrong firstly her passive isnt even a huge issue by itself the problem is the precedence this sets on the game global passives just for owning a character without them being on the team just a terrible idea its all cool now because you want castorice but wait till its a character you hate and dont want that gives your entire team shields periodically for just existing in your account or a character that gives everyone a free speed or a character that randomly gives someone energy its just a shit idea for any game and if you think this is the only time they are going to do this global passive mechanic i have a bridge to sell you this is dumb and should not be tolerated again its fine if it didnt work in endgame content which is designed to be challenging but from everything weve seen it does
i want her but i dont have the game
in deed its a powerfull skill however its also part of the lore and unique in the game dont talk about a character skill its just a mere skill in a huge game overflowing in content
so when ur having any in vulnerability u dont count as a player on the objective so when u lose hulk form and go to banner ur immortal so ur not on point
the reason players are angry is because of the flipping precedent of the future global passives its hilarious that the whole frustration is built on a bunch of whatifism
it maybe a weird take but if they implement these global passives to character majority of players will summon for i dont think its as bad for example of players with an abundance of jades will summon for castorice another example is if this feature is used again and given to phainon like who tf in their right minds will skip phainon lol
curiositykitten are u dumb lol you cant eat food buffs in abyss theater endgame content
i mean being able to cook in the abyss doesnt really help you since you still cant eat it
creativecontent unless its part of her passive and she just eats it in the middle of abyss without use of a gadget like i said though it was a questionable leak
curiositykitten nah the leaks are real ur just dumb cus somehow you end up thinking that a character could use their exploration passive in abyss
all i see are unique kits that are important to the plot just like acheron
this is just powercreep at it again people be like this hasnt happened before remember acheron
honestly i highly doubt there will be any more global passives and if there are i also highly doubt it will be related to damageplease let this comment age well
why are people mad about it im not getting it bc you dont even have to have her in the team for that to work which is overpowered and good
danjin powercreep what is that
the buff aint that good tbh i get hating globals i do but more of id hate it if it was a dmg enhancing skill survival issues should never happen anyway and if it can happen once good chance ur team was gonna die again unless u died like at or something and for those worried about them just going to keep adding more yeah i can see that being concerning but good news is second half likely wont and also wont have any globals in any characters kits so these globals either are gonna be a super rare thing for a characters if it happens again that is but given they made a custom ui for global passives i dont doubt there may be another in the long future
lets be honest the passive itself does not matter its the fact that there is a passive like that to begin with which opens to door to more egregious global passives to follow it its been the topic of outrage for a while now and anyone whos pretending that its a problem only now is a fool
and the world kept spinning anyways i hope they keep it
this video is kinda missing the point the problem is not the passive itself like aa revive ok but the concept of a global passive is not good cause they can add more and more and passives can include dmg bonus crit bonus speed bonus etc and then hoyo balance endgame around that then it will not be good hoyo has proven to be able to powercreep mecanics example topaz numby and herta technique
did the revive cleansed debuff
dont pull her if you dont like her passive
having castorice to counter hoolay but forgot that hoolay on his enchanted state
bro they just mad cause they pulled for mydie
anyways free ruan mei
when shes part of the party sure you could tie into her lore since shes basically death incarnate so she could control death but global seems a bit overkill
it is really not good thats what msjes character broken in a bad way
people is overreacting a lot this isnt that big of a deal powercreep will happen from one way or another of course its wrong to have this mechanic around but compared to a character that has busted scalling and makes every single team look the same i think that i prefer this but youll have to pull this new global passive or else your account will be worse yes but we will have to pull in every single case its like complaining that you cant clear moc with seele and supports its a gacha not a balanced jrpg there will always be powercreep that force us to pull better characters like cant you all just save for that unexisting global passive there is a bigger picture but that picture is realizing where you are standing on you are literally complaining about the main monetization method of the game avoiding this passive style wont avoid powercreep you are just asking for them to sugarcoat it
its nice but if you dieng you dont need cash youd need skill
if im dying during a battle i am dying again cause im not ready for it lol i think i can count on my fingers the number of times a revive could actually have saved me
if its okay bc of lore accurate they should buff seele so she can dodge all enemy attacks dude lorewise seele is faster than sniper bullet it is meter per second without trying
this is such a bad argument cause all i need to say is this genshin and zz have barely been criticised for their level as power creep as much as sr and your arguments are just missing the point of why people are mad powercreep is always inevitable but when its every other week in a game like this its not very good global passives are now just making this situation worse like genshin hasnt had as much of a power creep problem then star rail has and that game has been out for over years and star rail has been out for nearly and thats just maddening cause there a prime example of how it works but they are just choosing not to do it your excuses are just literally please dont stop insulting my game youre hurting my feelings at this point
teddyisaliar its faster because we are getting characters at a faster rate in that case they should add less characters per patch but we wont be able to make them change their mind because we already had a patch with just one new character and it sold less than the rest im comparing both bad routes and i think that global passives are less worse than keeping powercreeping every single patch i dont expect them to change their ways of design drastically when they know that making kits overloaded is working i hope that if they keep the global passive route they try to at leats making it a slot where you put character to support the team and add a fp option to put there i hate both cases and i know that we all want the game to improve but you cant expect them to literally choose to lose money i would love for them to stop the hp inflation but they wont for me at least it hasnt been a problem i can complete every single endgame mode full stars and i havent expended a single dollar on this game people is doing pull less accounts and can get to stars on moc so i guess that everyone should try checking their builds or invest their jades in a better team that doesnt require them to optimize it or read enemy mechanics
dikikai okay this is just all kinds of wrong and self centered and ignoring alot of factors okay first off the thing is just a bad cause know what other game pulls has banners and doesnt no one talks about powercreep zz cause its not a problem so it can be done and the last part is just the poor rich company excuse and comparing both routes both routes are bad cause they are both intertwined cause if we have to live with the constant powercreep is adding global passives which we fully know is gonna be exploited really a great idea for this game people have already called it greedy so now is it fair people are just gonna get an immediate disadvantage cause a character just exists even then they get powercrept there passives are just gonna be there and im the near future when it all gets stacked it gonna be so not new player and returning player friendly cause of the hp inflation and all the mechanics unless you whip out the bank card and get spending if you hate both cases then why are you literally going out of your way to justify and defend it and make out people are overreacting when this is a serious problem for the near future and lose out on money you do realise this can be a double edged sword cause people can just drop the game instead and say enough is enough and the last part is literally the worst part i havent had a problem so i think its okay and other people should get good and make better choices and look at themselveswhat do you even know what your saying lets break it down you literally went i havent had this problem therefore its not really a problem yes for you new players and returning this definitely isnt a problem cause you missed out and you are gonna pay for it cause you havent been keeping up with the meta check their builds you make it out to be like its something we can control yes let me just ask get relics from the hand of god and im sure hell deliver oh wait i cant cause the whole system is rng what bad defence invest their jades better yes lets invest our jades fully knowing hoyo can easily just decide to change how the game works and then that character is useless hey remember sparkle well guess what shes useless now cause we going all in on the break meta now so hurry up and catch up again a terrible defence enemy mechanics really whats that you invested all your jades into the lastest black swan and wanting to use your kafka dot team well sorry but you see the current moc and endgame content is revolving around break and follow up attack and its gonna be like this for the next few patches so even tho you lost hard pity and lost all your jades go get firefly and ruan mei to have a chance do you actually see how flawed your reasoning is your defences are literally dont mean to the big company i understand this is a bad situation but this is kinda actually your fault for not getting good rng on relics and poorly investing your jades even though hoyo can decide to change how the game functions any moment on a whim just stop already you literally lost all creditability when you said i understand this is bad but decided to justify and defend it and make out people are the problem cause they cant predict the future
teddyisaliar you cant say that is unplayable when there are literally zero cycles done with es or es and whats your excuse for people being able to have zero pull accounts and still make it to stars from time to time its a resource management game you cant complete it you failed at it as easy as that aside from that is powercreep really that big of a deal i mean would you leave the game only because you couldnt complete moc with stars because i think if the only thing avoiding you leaving the game are like jades per patch then yeah leave you are not enjoying the other of the game and why so annoyed of a random comment on a short to the point where you literally make up a narrative about how i was defending hoyo and felt bad because you attacked the game when i literally said that i dont liked the idea but at least it wasnt that bad and it still depends on hoyo if they make it busted or balanced aside from that do you think that hoyos looking for feedback here they dont care about us when has the english community gotten anything out of their complains castorice sells will be high anyway and we cant do anything about that if thats their green light to keep making global passives
dikikai okay the first comment literally just showed you just ignored everything i said like you really think people can just choose who they get and want you really think they can always be prepared when they suddenly change meta you really think everyome can get lucky in pulls and relics is it really a big of a dealjesus christ you are literally ignoring the whole point of this whole discussion power creep on games is bad the whole point of playing a game is for challenge and enjoyment and if the game is literally becoming unenjoyable because the game is getting really bad with how its handling said game you are literally doing it again you just ignoring the whole point of the discussion and annoyed who said im annoyed im just baffled at people like yourself cause your logic makes no sense cause again you say you understand why people are not happy i called out how your messages come across and you just ignore what i say to fit your own narrative and your whole things is they wont care so im just gonna accept and again justify and blame other people for it and again you still fail to understand you just go well rn its not that bad and thats the point look at powercreep its already bad and if you really think that global passives aint gonna be a its a just maybe it will be then idk what to say also i didnt make up a narrative this is literally what you said yourself you literally just went i know its a problem but ill justify it regardless just at this point just stop if this is just a comment on a short just dont bother then
teddyisaliar you still didnt mention why people can make it with pulls personally im baffled of people that are going to quit because they cant get a star or two per patch youll got so far with this game just to say hoyo make every single team viable or ill leave thats a tantrum and shows that you arent enjoying the game most of the content isnt even endgame so why bother if you only will enjoy of it at that point that became a job
dikikai pulls yea i dont believe that at all cause that just sounds like you making stuff up and you are baffled cause of that reason again you missing the point no one is asking making all teams viable people are asking stop the power creep give characters a chance stop changing the meta on a whim give characters an actual chance to shine or idk add a character who can actually help older characters its not just about a star its about the potential state of the game what are you literally failing to understand here now you just contradicted yourself cause you clearly show you have no idea whats going on here so just stop you are just a hypocrite at this rate
teddyisaliar go and do a google search there are many accounts doing pulls if they can you can git gud p
well what ever pulls i have for her are going to her but im done spending anything else the game had a good run for me but not anymore if the story doesnt pick up from here and its still mid thats that ananta and arkk is coming soon so time to peace out while the power creep is still fresh
honestly on brand for her lore
i hope we get one copy of her for free tied to story progress
womp womp
i like it i want it i need it what i would expect from fireflys love rival
lol i dont give a fuck if its pay to win i just want her cause shes cool and adorable as hell
to me as long it isnt states or big then it is fine no that shield at the start if the battle isnt broken that flat def is tho like imagine the new healer just gives outgoing healing bonus that would be op but to me as long they dont make them stackdont make them too strong then i dont mind it i have played hird and they have the divine key system which gives you buffs based on if you get some specific weapons you dont need the have them to clear the endgame content tho maybe they changed in part last time i played was when fu hua got a new battle suit
i love that this is the final straw for players not silver wolf who gave enemies a weakness that they didnt have in order for it to make it easier to break their shields not ruan mei who gave you crazy buffs to break through opponents a lot more easier not robin who have your team an forward attack but also does crazy attack damage buffs for your characters not firefly who gives the enemy an automatic fire weakness when using her skill not acheron who was the first crazy damage dps character we actually got not sunday who boots us forward and our little pets that we take into battle not fugue who automatically gives us super break and gives the enemy a nd shield break for massive bonus damage not tribi who needed c or c to do crazy amounts of team wide damage i forgot which one it is but now this is the final straw all i have to say to people getting upset about this isget the fuk outta here with this bullshit bruh the game has always been predatory the game has always had must pulls ruan mei being probably the longest running one until fugue came out
the fact that youre trying to present this as if its even a debate on whether this is even a possibility that its ok grow some guts and stop fence sitting
just skip if you hate it
idk i have a guarantee
what do you mean shes a must have now im just fine with my aventurine always ending fights with full hp on everyone
yeah im not going to lie shit like this is probably going to kill star rail
the reason why people are against the global passive is because this opens up the possibility that future characters have global passives as well and with hsrs history of power creeping within a couple of patches this could lead to global passives being way too powerful for the game leading to the endgame content being centred around these global passives which will essentially lock anyone who doesnt have these characters out of endgame content
they probably want users to use the free rolls on her v thats why they are pushing her so much
nah yall hating too much it aint game changing nor mandatory
wait are you saying that even if she isnt in the team character will be revived
the problem was and it has never been the passive itself as its kinda useless in endgame but how unfair its to being active even without cas on the team and the horrific precedent it makes to future characters and global passives
lore accurate my hoyo made this lore of hers
idc its just a single player idle game it doesnt matter if its op or not as long its a single player game
people are overreacting its literally hp you could get revived at the worst time and essentially waste it lol
oh no a pay to win character in a gatcha game never almost like every other hsr character that power creeps the previous or that they have never balanced the endgame around who is currently on banner
it dosent bother me tbh i think thats fine because she is a anniversary character the last anniversary character could kill every monster on the map or in the simu which makes so many things easier and safes a lot of time but that was okay for the community now the people just overreact in my opnion but well thats just my opnion
bruh why does everyone forget about bailu being able to do the same and at higher hp to
the thing is i understand that people think it opens the pandoras box and were gonna get passives that increase crit and energy soon and other things like thatbut will we really maybe im putting too much faith in hoyo but the global passive is attached to castorice an anniversary character theyre supposed to be special like that we also got a pretty damn broken technique with acheron who was an anniversary character imo much more fomo ability than what castorice has revive is pretty inconsequential if you have a well built team hoyo definitely heard the playerbase is not happy with the global passive but decided to give it to her anyways now we just need to wait and see what they do with it in the future for all we know she could be the only character with a global passive and this all will be forgotten in a few months time maybe theyll give global passives to everyone and make it a gameplay feature by only allowing you to have global passives of your choice or something like that either way we dont know what will happen but im willing to give them the benefit of doubt until then im still having fun with the game so this is nothing to quit over for me
having this global passive is amazing and i dont mind how broken is it
im glad they kept the passive a didnt cave for streamers making a big deal
cant wait for when we can debuff so much enemy acheron no need stacking to use ult
idk if anyones gonna see or read this but im going to say it anyway hsr is probably the same track with hird where powercreep is at its worst and old s ranks star equivalent characters are not only unusable but literally forgotten to the point hoyo gives them for free it has already started with ruan mei and luocha from the livestream and they will probably continue for me global buffs are definitely broken and maybe should not be in the game and i will agree if it is the case for a game with pvp feature the thing is hsr is a single player game and theres literally no need for competitiveness to enjoy it so global buffs meant nothing but having an easier time clearing endgame contents if youre worried about not getting every jades from moc apoc and pf then get what you can and strategize your pull no ones forcing you to pull every characters no ones forcing you to top up and no ones forcing you to clear every endgame content so just do your own thing in the game and if you dont enjoy it anymore just leave it i literally dont understand this drama cause why are you all worrying when you dont even need to be competitive in this game and castorice will probably get powercreep again in the future this is a gacha game with honkai in its title if you dont play hi then just know that the powercreep is gonna get worse so be prepared and do your math for your pulls
doesnt matter if its tide to the lore or not unfortunately the door that this global passive opens is just too huge to ignore if hoyoverse would say its okay we will never use it again because it is tied to the anniversary character then id be less pestimistic but we are talking about hoyoverse and leaks already comfirmed multiple global passive characters coming worse is if this character sells well wich she probably will other gacha corporations will get a peek out of it meaning that there is a very good chance that hoyoverse just released a cancer into the gacha genre infecting all future games as well as long as they get away with it other companies will try to do same scumy and greedy methods as well now all characters will feel like that they are a must pull wich makes the game wich is already pretty predatory into even more predatory big sad
saying its lore accurate is literally the most pathetic excuse possibleif you really want to make it lore accurate then just make her intakill enemies when entering battleget trianne out of tribbies animationmake jingliu do times the damagecompletly change sparkle kit while youre at itgive aventurine his pseudo emanator powersmake silver wolf actually able to just erase enemiesmake kafka control enemies and make blade immortal those are just people trying to defend a character they likeif it was someone they didnt like they would be angry tooshe didnt even need this passive to work when shes out of the teamif it only worked on battle it would be but they had to make it global and im actually curious about somethingis there a reason people actually like her or was it just because yes we dont know shit about herthe most she did on the story quest was talking with cerces and pulling the flamereaver into the century gate and thats about itmost of the time shes just doing things for aglaea if someone could explain the castorice hype i would be grateful
for me its good if its just a castorice thing and dont influence that much on the battle itself now when we get a global crit dmg buff then it starts to be a problem
they can either limit how much global passive you can use or disable it in end game content they havent done neither in beta
its not the strength of the ability that people are upset about its the precedent that this now sets into place that is
im fine with it since its castorice and all but i hope this isnt going to be a precedent imagine a really good global passive on some ipc filth or something thatd be horrendous
thank god the didnt take it away
i honestly dont care i play for the story and obtain characters that i like and will def pull for cas shes so pretty update i got cas yeppiiee
yes lore i hope they start makin mc now hit enemie into oblivion fore the lore
not even the literal gods or archons in genshin had this ability
should i pull for castorice or jiaoqiu i got tickets right now
yeah we deffinetly will think abou acheron kind of charge or silver wolfs weakness insertion
when has your if its just a x thing thing ever come true in gacha gaming there is already a leaked character with global passive in his kit and more in the works and all of them one after the other even certain collab character has one
riyozsu i should have guessed and let me guess global passive is about crit stats right
itzsmoof it can be worse waay worse what if global passives stacks like if you have a you get a permanent speed boost if you have b you get a crit rate and crit damage boost if you have c you receive sp per turn if you have d you receive healing every round if you have all of them you just receive a permanent speed boost healing crit rate and crit damage and sp i just want to adress that star rail still a game that plays around the last char launched to its max so what if this becomes the new standard
yep hsr is already horrible with power creep this adds another level in that can easily make it so much worse
it completely nullifies the other supports that can revive teammates if she had to be in the team i wouldnt mind it much but not even having to be on the team is ridiculous not to mention her whole lore is tied to death as in bringing it not reversing it if they actually go through with this itll be the dumbest thing ive ever seen a gatcha game do they still have time to get rid of it ive wanted to pull for her since i saw her from the start i was drawn to her design and lore immediately i still do but i dont wanna condone this ngl ill still probably pull her but it wont be bc of the passive i just like her character all around i also want hyacine so i hope they dont give her some ridiculously op ability
errorwebpagenotfound same i do intend to pull for her but not for the passive whatsoever
i hope they make a character that boost all ally crit so i dont have to rely much on rng for good stat
errorwebpagenotfound bad news they cant change it anymore its now on the official livestream if this is adjusted hoyoverse might be sued by the chinese server for fraud
due to her authority over death its likely she is able to revive someone as well but has been killing people due to her being neglected and not having the power to control it it might still be lore accurate that said i dont think it is busted at all but imagine we someday get anaxas or silver wolfs weakness implant as global passives or who knows what
exactly
fr bro people say that her global passive is no biggie wait till hoyo release global passive that increase dmg cr or cd in the future
sairenji from what i heard they have a global passive of speed crit rate and damage lined up so that sounds like fun xd
it doesnt set presidance for shit dude oh no global passive of hp revive and everyone instantly cries pay to win cut the bullshit seriously crying about something that is honestly situational as fuck and isnt as good at first glance and then going out of your way to review bomb is the most sociopathic behavior on par with the political bullshit that goes on these days stfu and actually see how it works out when it lands then make a decision judging shit before it even lands i swear these people grew up becoming either the most spoiled or the most unnecessarily angry little children
the precedent it sets it a global revive at health that is tiny in the grand scheme of things and i cant wait for everyone to be like wow we were wrong it isnt game changing or precedent setting
ethanowen no thats not what it sets missed the point entirely
but what comes of this in the future as the straw that breaks the camels back a speed boost globally or an attack boost cause what this shows is that itll be below if you take a full revive at health as the precedent
ethanowen a global passive that gives crit boosts or weakness implants you tell me it shouldnt be a thing
ok lets say you get a global passive that gives a crit boost it would be small and negligible at best cause castorice as a precedent means that everything will be ok i have it neat not a oh god i need to pull for her or ill lose every moc thing
ethanowen characters shouldnt be giving boosts for outside of their party and lets be real here its hoyoverse i wouldnt put it past them to add a passive so broken that it trivializes content
i mean yeah but also what do you expect them to do cause lets say they curb power creep right how do they do that realistically you make acheron mydei and blade all the same level imma just pull two dps and call it a day a ton of supports would be gutted like adventurine would have to be annihilated cause he is the root cause of all this theres no solution and global passives can curb it ie make a global passive that debuff the team but gives them a buff in another area in return
ethanowen listen to that one word scheme you sound and the rest of the haters sound ridiculous
ethanowen wahh is all i hear right now do you hear how ridiculous you sound karen
silverdwarven no i hit the nail on the head
bait who are you
ethanowen global passives will create an imbalance and only further the currently extreme power creep
silverdwarven no it wont
bait how so
""
silverdwarven if you cant see how crazy you all sound then i cant help you there is no point is having a discussion with people who refuse to actually hear the other points
bait i literally just asked you to explain tf are you on about
bait to explain and hope you understand one is better than zero right so if you have one and another person has zero the other person has less and is behind so if someone has something that provides something without even needing them on the team then that is a passive boost that the person with zero wouldnt have making their account worth less than the person with the one i agree that the current global passive isnt the greatest but whats stopping them from putting a character with a terrible global and making a few eidolons that make that passive better lets use an example i saw earlier crit damage what if they increased your teams crit rate by but if you got them to e it increases to then e doubles it to now you have a must pull for crit teams that doesnt even need to be on your team a must pull that you have to get six other times i may add its a scam to make people spend more money on their game im personally skipping global passive banners but thats just me do what you want and think how you want but this will become a bigger issue in the future if nothings done about it
i think hoyo will add a enemy that instantly kills a character on turn and this passive will become mandatory to get full gems in endgame good luck if you skip her hoyo is selling you the fix to a problem you never thought existed
sairenji the most bonkers passive will be spd imagine a gp that boost speed by
sairenji people say her global passive is no biggie because it is the issue isnt cas having one even if its good realistically you wont need it a lot if you play well its the existence of it and more in the future
watchandliveforever the next enemy will instantly drop your team hp to its basically to sell burst healer and castorice well doesnt matter tho just another cheap boring gimmick even ape can solve what matters is that we knew that will see another hp padding on end game content much fun such creative very original cant wait for damage bonus global passive
caramelcwossont its literally what i say
jestm im saying they added this global passive for a reason i see it having instant death in the future and the response from hoyo will be its a global passive so you dont even need castorice in your team to negate it just have her on your account even meta gamers wont be able to survive without it if its instant death on turn theres a reason they made it global passive and not limited to her being in your team its to add instant death mechanic ingame for the future its called selling a fix to a problem that doesnt exist
ethanowen the speed boost global passive is donkey
watchandliveforever instant death wont come without certain gimmick we can do to prevent it unless its from an optional hidden boss instant death attack in turn based rpg is pretty common its just that its usually came from ultra rare miniboss mob or secret hiddenoptional boss anyway as long as the gimmick is good i dont mind even as shitty as hoyo is i still believe that theyre not greedy enough to do something that bad like making unavoidable party wipe that cannot be prevented if they actually go that way thatll pretty much be the decisive evidence that hoyo is officially the worst and greediest game company in the world ps in more hardcore tbrpg instant death otk or anything similar is actually pretty normal if you played smt wizardry or other roguelike game even modern one like darkest dungeon getting your party wiped out randomly is pretty common well those game are not gacha tho almost
jestm well we wont know for certain its just one of the reasons im making sure i get atleast a copy of her just incase it would suck to find out i need her later on and be stuck waiting for a rerun lol
zogar i dont see why people complain about powercreep in hoyo its been that way since gun girl z and isnt going to stop
errorwebpagenotfound castorice according to lore represents the death titans hand of life her sister pollixia or the dragon is the hand of death so u are wrong about her lore
precendent bro this has been there since day
lrkdono explain then plz
i hate this feature i pulled her and cant undone hsr is gonna get less fun
watchandliveforever nah they already catered to castorice now theyll be catering to the next few characters they release if you spent money for castorice get ready to spend more
bailu powercreep aahh
there are greater problems out there then crying over gacha gamesplease take your energy somewhere else and quit those kind of games jeez
passive cool global passive not cool was already gonna get her anyways but it sets some form of precedent where youll wanna go after every character after to get their global passives if they decide to go through with it powercreep is also crazy as bailu can only revive while on the team but castorice can just do it without being on the team halfway across the universe sipping on some apple juice
as long as its something benign and not a stat buff i genuinely dont care the genshin glazers should have stopped this bullcrap when certain characters gave quality of life travel features as part of their kit oh you want to fly gotta get wanderer oh you want to jump higher then pull venti or kazuha stop acting like this is anything new in hoyos bag it will become an issue if its a stat boost and then the real battle begins
it is not a pvp game why are people complaining about this amazing mechanic hoyoverse players in general are the worst fandom i did not see people crying about acheron mechanic this much only getting hype for her do you want castorice pull do you want to skip castorice to pull for another one wait her rerun and get another character hoyoverse is not putting a gun in your head and saying pull for her now
castorice will be the death of hsr
it doesnt really matter ive been playing since and the beginning was the hardest i dont even die anymore in end game content she is also not a must pull just because of this just pull for what you want
making the game pay to win isnt it already i mean its a gacha game lol i dont like it if it worked only in du or something like select a global passive mechanic then i would like
me skipping her for anaxa xd
people defending this shi
i personally think its not a big prob at all
if we make it as far as hsr newcomers are gonna get a character that skips the entire story for them
okey the problem it is a global passive yes but also what precedent are they putting here because after her other characters would need it as well one thing is she would revive her teammates while on the team similar to bailu powercreep doesnt have anything here it has been here for a long while we all know but having a global passive might turn hsr into a different game in my opinion couse every character would need or they wouldnt sell as well
man who cares i want castorice
patch solo moc level arlan with global passive from other characters
watch phainon powercreep her somehow bc hes important in the story
i dont really care i like this theres free five stars going to be out on april and other stuff i really like this and im more into hsr story anyway lol so i dont mind
uhh does anybody use preservation and abundance units
does everyone know that almost every boss in endgame content can basically one shot every team just me thats why castorices global passive wouldnt really be much of a difference not only is it lore accurate but its also convenient since it just looked like i got that one destruction or erudition blessing on du just way worse but still works
just dont pull for her then
i think that those who want castorice will get this buff as cherry on top those who dont want her can continue on their game as they did in the past years
yall are too emotional for a pve game
i see why people dislike it but i honestly have no problem with it
to all the babies who think this game is too hardjust pull castorice
can revive doesnt mean u can hit kill boss which means its not too op
wth is this controversyits simpleif you dont want her dont pullif you want then pullbruh
i dont think this is too much of an op featurehowever it does set a bad precedent
i dont really play hsr because how hard it always was because you need well bulit characters to build characters and obtain new ones but to get new ones you already need powerfull well built characters and the powercreep is just ugh it makes hsr unplayable for me but global passive that is definetly too much and im afraid that hoyo might do that to zz and genshin too but zz devs at least listen to their community
my characters always die i would love this i love her and her design
im mostly pulling for her bc of that awesome dragon ngl actually the first female im going out of my way to pull for and then saving for anaxa and then phainon
this wouldnt be a problem if she isnt a limited character its not a global passive but a technique you can use hoyo potentially planning to make new characters with more global passive that basically gatekeep end game content being lore accurate is such a bad excuse if being faithful to lore is so important how come emenators had to spend point to use their godlike power and why isnt dan heng use his awaken dragon powers all the time
lol imagine in the future global res penglobal speed buffsglobal crit buffs yeah were cooked
people complain everyday who cares
i would prefer to have the option to turn her passive off if shes not in the team i have no issue with it if shes in the team its similar to bailus revive but i dont want this to be triggered of shes not on the team
with or without passive im pulling for her regardless i just like the character
second anniversary character btw and people are complaining
i dont really think hp revive with no kind of protection can harm the balance that much and hoyoverse have made pw since their name was mihoyo is that really a thing to consider at now after like years of the games service and over decade of pw game systems they have done
hmm bailu is the key
i dont like it because hoyo always finds a way to implement this type of stuff in bosses like oh yall got castorice now we gon make a boss that one shots your teammate once good luck
if it were a mechanic to revive a character at hp every burst
for good reason
i dont really care i dont remember when last time any of my characters died in any endgame content
i decided months ago that i pull for her so it couldnt be more irrelevant for me and i think there are a lot more that thinks similarly
this is a single player ffs
i dont think it will be a problem it was probslly planned for niche mechanics and with all the backlash it will be like that either eay
why do people complain this is great for the ones who could get her if not thats their bad luck not other peoples nor hoyos problem
broke as people crying its not our problem you cant pull for her because you pulled another character with you precious broken person resources
i dont really play hsr the last character i pulled was mei but if i had to give an opinion id say the revive is fine its a one time use anyway so it wont impact most of endgame and shes by far the dps queen ppl are tripping if they think thats powercreep
for me whos care i definitely still in this game if dont u like just leave and i will tell to hoyo to make ur account will take it by hoyo himself
man afte scrolling through comment i am glad i left hoyo community bro wth are those braincell people
no one is forcing anyone to pull for characters you have free will and your money is your responsibility
were forgetting a character bailu who does the same but just once tho
the people who are saying castorice is a must pull are overacting on purpose she has a fp team and options but shes still high restrictive and her passive isnt something thats going to be the reason you clear end game
would be nice if they removed the passive from the character and give the passive to every player that completes the story quest as a permanent buff of sorts that would be nice
the passive is a problem only if its the first of many more in the future right now its not that big of a deal people who can clear endgame will be able to clear it still if they need to rely on her passive its their skill issue the lack of a decent star fp lc for castorice is the real problem in my opinion the passive is a problem only if they start releasing other passives in the future the lack of lc options pisses me off more than the passive
i for one appreciate the ability to revive a fallen character mid battle it has been lacking in this game for a long time and im stuck because i cant defeat a boss
its fine i still have faith for my aventurine build
if they are whining over that they should worry about the other stuff such as the hp pool in the end game contents either way i dont mind im to busy playing du with my characters
hilarious how she isnt even the first character with a global passive and shes getting hate i swear if it was a male character like mydei or phainon the hate will be close to nonexistent with the reasoning of he is a king he deserves this or its kebin ofc he should get this privilege
this pve game so pw must quit
then dont imagine not getting castorice as a challenge rather than something else its not like we can all pvp if we can pvp then that is a problem but this is only pve
its powercreep because every character will have this if not mihoyo wont be able to sell characters there are confirmed passives that will be released in couple of versions
who cares about lore its a precedent to make gacha games even more predatory
it wouldnt be as much of a problem if they didnt arbitrarily limit banners
bro im getting her and also she is the reason why tectone quit
what the fuck
well idk about her i will not pull her at all bc i dont need a passive so that my characters comes back zk when you lose in endgame or so is says use your brain in someway or something like that is just my opinion she looks cute yes and the character design is nice but i really dont like the passive i know she is death but still fail in battle and come stronger back so i see that but ppl have different opinions
power creep of doom
the even when shes not in the party definitely should be fixed but the revive is great since unlike genshin you cant use any of the items sitting in your bag for healing or reviving in battle so having more characters with that passive is great it just needs to be balanced so its active when their in the party
but didnt they say she defies death something like that thats why they put that passive on her
hi player heh first time
dont worry guys artoria fate collab character will also have global passive since she will most likely to never come back due to license issues this will be only chance to get her
they are starting to shaft the fp players this is a big l for hsr give them star review and boycut buying stuff in their games dont let them get away with this im saying this as a big spender who dosnt get hit by this but they are ruining the experiance for those who dont
its been done before hoyo create a problem solved by pulling limited character before skill point issue d dan heng sparkle now hit by boss castorice
cry about it does the game have a secret pvp mechanic or something why do you all care about powrcreep so muc only whales will go to endgame with the best characters anyway
i mean you just need to pull her once not get any eidolon or build her yes is is op and i dont like it but you just need her once and all your team are buffed they are mad for no reason each new character is a money grab attempt thats why every character is better with more eidolon and with their weapon
bailu can revive too
the passive is frankly not all that cuz ur character would still count as dead and thus u would miss out on of the stars in endgame however the problem comes when later down the line they release incredibly broken global passives like giving your entire account crit ratedmg
this doesnt seem like a big issue if the passive only works if she is on the team but merely just her existing in your unlocked databank that is way too strong
global passive on a character is the dumbest thing hoyo could implement why it is bound on a character they just could give it to all who clear moc or an event or something else but with that situation rip hsr it was great with you
i like her
just dont die
honestly i get what they are saying because that mechanic is insane ist really dumb that it still activates when she isnt present im just gonna get her for that passive and yes ik i dont have to i just want the actually clear the moc for once hope they dont make future global passives like this
westerns always complaint what your expect this game free of course you need pay to win mechanics for money
its fine if your character die in the first place revive wont do anything your character will still die
if they removed her ability i would be twenty times for death from all the events good thing she coming as fp having her will be worth especially in dv higher level main storyline
bye bye game i swear if no one quits the game than your all hippocrates and two faced liers
the way i see it is they can add global passives i like the idea but make it anniversary character exclusive
when i first saw the leaks i was one of the people that defended hoyo and said that they whould never do something so stupid as to add a global passive making a character a must pull i whould like to apologize because infact they where that stupid and i was even more stupid to think they whould remove it when it went untouched till v i am sorry i was stupid
i dropped the game for a while but bailu does the same thing no
global passive powercreep in the future
on the one hand i approve of other characters getting a revive mechanic which for the longest time was exclusive to bailu but on the other hand i dont like castorice having it as she isnt a healer
i dont even think my team will need this passive since my team rarely died
must have op its literally one of the worst possible global passives of all time if one of your characters get downed then you suck and she wont save you
i honestly dont really care since i never planned on pulling for her but shes death her reviving makes no sense
i mean do you really die in this game its actually not that big of a deal and dont hit me with what about future gp for other characters we wait and see if the game isnt for you dont play it we eatin good with hsr
this is like gen into gen characters in pgr but it worked out great for kuro meanwhile i dont see any positive thing about this for the future of hsr
when i think about this passive its not that op to me
i dont see the problem my team never die the only problem is never can deal damage enough before cycle limit
i think acheron is still more pay to win lol havent battled roaming enemies since i got her
i just want castorice for the cool asf dragon
theres a concentrated amount of people that think too much about the global passive even though they have no basis to think anything from what they think is in hoyo plans to bring if all these people really cared about characters becoming must pull because of the global passives they might get as the game would adjust the content accordingly they wouldve left the game after first few patches because any new character even without global passives creates the quoted menace any extra strong character like acheron in her time the herta and mydei are all so strong that eventually all the content will rise to reflect their power het i see no one throwing tantrum and leaving hsr global passives will do no difference if they make a character must pull well people will pull otherwise they will cry here like they already cried before saying how they cannot close content without a character forwards whom the content was targeted
dont apologize to the sociopaths they wrong
finally some worth spending my money
i dont think this is going to cause an issue i mean its a broken passive but no one is forced to pull her so and also she only does it one time per battle its not like its infinite i think everyone just needs to pull the characters you like and enjoy the game and theres one thing i realized playing both genshin and star rail these communities always seem to find something to bitch about or complain about and no im not talking about the obvious issues with each game or the company major im talking about characters in particular or the art
i still find it ridiculous it works while she is outside the team either way i dont want her and my teams dont die sounds like a cyclers dream unit
dont worry guys she will be nerfed after months
if it was when shes on field only then fine like this its really bad
create lore proceed to let gaslight themselves thinking nah bro its her power make everyone pull for her proceed to milk everyone of their hardearned money classic hoyo bs
meanwhile the zz players are enjoying the bakery
i hate that since i dont play or pull any female charaters
yeah big whoop its always whine and whine but you literally dont need this passive if you build your teams right just sounds like a skillwallet issue to me
she is not a must pull just a really good pull if your team is dying even with your sustain something is wrong with your team or you just got unlucky
post after castorice drip a castorice video is out finally
to all those that are complaining just dont pull her
honestly if youre dying in endgame content that isnt the hardest du then thats actually embarrassing
the global passive is a neat idea on paper but in practice it can cause some controversies
i think its passive is interesting when even nikador titan of strife go to final form he had the ultimate move with throw spear whole team die
im ok with it until there is no pvp
gacha game pw oh no
crying about powercreeps and saying pay to win in a single player pve game is dumb to me
still better than dsgrand cross meta powercreeps i play it like years and still going i still dont see it how this would destroy the game eventhough everyone disagree with global passive already explain few things for those who says powercreep and such youre only powercreeping yourself its not even pvpbased competition so why everyones still good actually for those who feel likes castorice forcing you to pull her just dont pull her so she doesnt destroy your gameplay i think amphoreus characters are already accurate lore since theyre humans who went demigods so they can grantuse supernatural powers nah what am i saying with this one why not decide it on some endgame content creators to see if its really op or not like what people said why decided it bad when all we see her is from beta leaks basically every single games wrung out our wallets playing pw on game is like online casino where you gamble your money maybe spend your money only on guaranteed items like costumes or such no one forces you to gamble these characters will surely have a rerun but if only you had patience enough my suggestions pull what you need not what you want basically thats all of my problems with people complaining about this patch im just venting out with these unending complaints even on other hoyo games
ppl think hoyo will release more global passives after watching them never release another dot unit
dont care about it at all pull or not doesnt bother me
dont be surprised if some super fast boss like hoolay in the future has x dmg and the only way to finish late game content perfectly is to have x amount of global speed and dmg buff from y characters spend that extra astrogem to get some character you dont like with global x ya whales
who cares she is a waifu it would be worse if this hability was on a dick chara
the hsr community is cooked divided and full of hatred for the company they once cheered genshin could never what a community to be in
good in other end games but not moc
bro even in genshin you need qiqi or barbara to stay in the team to do that n thats also locked behind their last cons bruh what is this
this game more updates every single free to play player cannot play anymore
its a dangerous concept because we know later they will do the same with things like crit rate crit damage hp and energy regen
i personally dont give af let hoyo experiment with something new i cant see any universe where these global passives are so broken that your account is bricked without it if that happens then you can complain because right now we dont know what they are planning to do ive skipped a lot of characters that people say is a must or have and guess what i have always cleared moc without failing i could even do with some older dps characters if i really wanted to older units arent as weak as some people make it out to be a lot of older units just need the right weakness to clear they cant brute force anymore this is why i hate talking about powercreep because it doesnt exist what truly exist is hp inflation though which makes it feel like powercreep
im still gonna pull of her and her freaking dragon i aint missing the opportunity to have a dragon on my team
i would say simply not let the passive be active while shes not on the team and thats all the rest is fine like unless you have a healer or a character that some how autorgenes i dont see it as that op since you come back with hp like you will die in one hit and also it only does it time per battle so it can help lower players more casual ones or that dont have great builds and dont have the time to farm for better ones and like what do they mean with her being pay to win like yeah shes a powerful character but other characters are also powerful and its not like only with her you can kill x enemies to progress the game or something like it tldr stop complaining people just enjoy the game its not the end of the world just relax its just a game for everyone to enjoy at the end of the day just change her passive so she cannot use it while shes not in the team and thats all if you complain about her then just dont pull and thats all
seems cool but kinda weird if her passive works if shes not even in the team also why only hp you would have to have a healer included then and hope you can heal the character before they get taken out again
i mean if your dying anyways then i dont your current team is good enough lol the issue isnt about her abilities but rather potential problem where many characters will have global passives in the future however this wont be an issue if only castorice has a global passives since the worry is that future characters will have global passives so we can only hope hoyo makes sure to never make another global passive again
i guess mihoyo is just milking the players as much as possible genshin and hsr alike
love seeing incels crying about it
its such a stupid idea i dont want castorice i dont even really like her that much but with the global passive it would be just stupid of me not to get her even though i want to get the other amphoreus characters
global passive is crazy
me having pity and having pulls ready
lore accurate my ass
bruh its not that deep ppl that can beat moc will still be beating moc and ppl who cant beat moc will still not beat moc if you can beat moc having a revive will do jack shit and if you cant beat moc getting revived will just make you watch your character die again
i guess you could have fun with her till she is relevant for days till next character powercreeps her and you go for that one giving similar reasons
well like i said i love dragons theyre my favourite fantastical creatures and im a casual player i do understand the problem of her global passive though benching her for another character will be inevitable im pretty sure the characters of this patch will be powercreep probably in the next two adventures i aint wasting my anger on a game im playing casually
riyozsu i dont know about you but hyacine and cipher are definitely not gonna powercreep castorice
hauntinqghost right
dragon enjoyer d im gonna pull for the same reason
aichacamara basically what i wanted to say
blatant bait character dev self insert is sad
hauntinqghost phainon or saber will be
the devs just had to give that excuse so all the hoyoshills can defend it online
gazefubv and yall are just sociopathic karens who will find every reason to hate hate hate hate over thing that isnt bad
yeah then whats stopping them to give emanators global passives as well esp since all of the emanators are godly in their own right how about jade and aventurine who both have cornerstones theyre just glazing castorice no more reasons needed
keep crying about a feature in this non pvp game
remember the hp inflation yes this is the compensation for that shut
idc i mean the game is pay to win anyway lmao
just making it easier doesnt mean that without castorice you cant complete end game content if you havent been able to star moc so far it doesnt mean that if you have castorice you can immediately star moc
i have no problem with her having this ability however theres two issues with it first i really wish that this ability would only work if she is on your team second theres a chance that future characters will get ridiculous global passives like this one heck im putting all my cards that phainon will defo get a global passive ps i dont hate castorice btw in fact i like her character
poor bailu
this is a darn shame i really liked castorice if i was still playing the game i wouldnt pull for her because of the global passive it sets such a hugely damaging precedence for future content that im not willing to support
its once per battle once literally once and you still need to heal them from to some did people also forget that they are buffing old characters to keep up with harder content its like a good thing comes in at one ear and out the other but here comes one small thing that helps players who has that character and they rant like the game will explode
getting revive just simply exist in your account thats the problem what next hoyo gonna make character that can make you use character per team instead of like always luckily i left the game on rappa banner
heard that well get around two to three more of characters with global passive itd be funny if one of them have the ability to add levels to your talent skills
itd still be perfectly fine and lore accurate if it only affected the ones in her actual party it being global while also lore accurate is stupidly broken in a gameplay sense
slowly they will implement other future character that could do damage after all allies taking one turn even if not in the current party hoyo could implements du hysilen buff in her actual kit making the enemies taking whatever debuffs she gives to enemies yeah not so fun right when it does happen to those who proclaimed to be idc player play who you want i dont get why ppl hate castorice now youre obligated to pull for x character in the future lol
nah its ok for now were almost guaranteed to get her if theyll release another after this patch we might have a problem
power creep is crazy
yeah no i dont want to ruin my account def skip
they are turning simulated universe buffs into characters
at least they could change it so it only works when shes in the team but noo they want money ig
nah im good with that no problem those are yapping is a meta slaves western ofc since i just playing for fun not so competitive im okay with that
as a pure fp i could care less if shes op or not i just like her and will pull her will all the jade i grind and save
nah fam im pulling her even if that feature isnt there
everyone crying on single player game
no bro she isnt a must have if anything abt her is a must have its her dmg her passive is completely useless unless ur just shit at the game
i dont even know which side i should be on now
to the global defenders when we get a male character who gives a crit rate global passive i hope yall keep this same energy
if its about lore what about blade
actually if you take how often the enemies can hit in endgame to revive with hp doesnt make much difference if you do not have available interrupt healing most of the time its just making enemies do one additional move to take the character down for good i know this all too well with bailu during my early days with hsr so whats so broken with it im gonna make my acheron e instead of getting castorice this upcoming patch if i still have resources left after upgrading acheron ill go for fugue lol x dps so far i only have therta and shes pretty much enough for the rest of x as a damage dealer the rest of the x dpses ill take my time to decide not in a hurry if anything i have to say x gave me a pleasant surprise by having tribbie and current shine on erudition to make my argenti useful again after being benched for the longest time
its probably just for moc when casrorice is on your second team it would be weird if suddenly you get this ability just because you got casrorice
lore accurate if things were lore accurate acherons ult would kaveh enemys from the game
its not good for future environment because the threat of new broken global passive but i dont care i still enjoy the game i still pull for castorice even without that passive and i dont pull for other unit i dont want even they have broken global passive its still good game for gacha standard and i think free ruan meifuture limited exchange limited selectable and buff old unit is good
js get her rather complain like genshin player
anyone supporting it can go argue with a wall you have the same iq as the bricks anyway there are three more gp characters coming one increasing attack and another for the crits that is hideously over the line dont excuse this by any means
nah they shouldve made her free if this was gonna be the case at least make her temporarily free like dr ratio
no one is forcing you to spend money her
yeah they might make more unique passives and push the limit i understand that but her being pw or a must have is right and wrong at the same time pw u just need to get her e must have nah her global passive feels like lore accurate but if they make something like passive slot which u have to select one passive and only that one can work there will be no problems so peoples concerns are valid but being pw or must have doesnt make sense to me its just what they might do in the future
the main issue i see is the combination of a global always active passive once you get her and the fact shes a character you might be unable to get if youre fp or have to pay real money to get you could nerf the passive to only trigger when shes actively in battle at which point it would be a variation of bailus gourdful of elixir which can revive character and heal them partially castorice could only revive but would rely on others to do the healing in return she can revive several people not just one the global buffpassive itself would be fine if it wasnt linked to something you potentially had to use real money to buy if they were to introduce some kind of towerdungeon system where you have to beat a dungeon every week and in return you could choose a temp buff for your battles thatd be fine since you could do that even with fp teams from what ive heard castorice wont be the only one with a global passive other characters in the near future are supposed to have something similar and they will most likely all come out basically back to back if thats true any fp player has to essentially gamble and choose which global passive they want because being able to get all of the global passives might be very well impossible for them another issue is powercreep if were already at the level where a character even at level and never being used is able to provide a significant power boost to any team one has to wonder whats next on the agenda there has to be a balance at some point where new characters dont come with unique broken skills or otherwise the original characters are essentially going to end up being useless
sorry i dont fking care its not like last moc stage give you pull so
shh
my friend was going to pull for castorice when she heard about this passive she changed her mind because she found this absolutely ridiculous
the point isnt that its a passive revive the point is that its a global passive and since hoyo is doing it now who knows what future characters passive is gonna look like damagedef for just polling it
ignore it and play the game
maybe stay neutral and just keep playing but its getting harder to t_t
yeh just follow your heart and enjoy the game if you want to pull for her then go for it no need to trouble yourself on this problem peace is what keeps things normal
kuro its being very clear that hoyo just wants money nowadays but the fan base are weird af so yeah i am neutral but some things juts pisses me off
well if the future global passivegp are like cassies like youll now have chance for double drop on some trace material or you will now spend less credits on characters and synthesis if you get the character then its not that bad it doesnt make character must pull but if a global passive making a team go from cycle the moc to cycle the moc then yea just leave bcs then it becomes for most struggling people to must pull and it would be spice on wound that you dont like that character at all im also same boat with you idk ill only take side when ill see some more future gps
btw i saw cn reviews and they dont give a fk about gp so yea forget any chance of gp getting removed in future
play games that have more effort put into them than just marketing get away from hoyo
nelesyt some things like what anw just enjoy the game if u like the game then play it if u dont then dont play it dont listen to those salty butthead
this the only reason they dont care about the global passives is that the only character that has it right now is a op female dps that they were going to pull anyway but when a character they dont like gets one broken global passive they will go feral
male incels go defensive over fictional waifus even worse than women who simp for male charas true
finally my seele reach get crit rate with that
i would bro i would since i would get all characters anyway
i mean whats the harm its not like this game is competitive
users_zero and still wont crit with ult
isomeria xcom ptsd
users_zero please dont
nice cant wait to get that
fine by be i mean most meta teams need any damn male i dont own anyway and cant beat moc entirely so if the cycle moc people are quiet then fine by me
sared projecting at its finnest
they wont
anbuassasine because of that bullshit most game modes will be unplayable since they will be musttohave
hey man just saying the kits for phainon saber and archer already dropped and my oh my seems like theres no global passive surely hoyo must be doing something wrong then right
elephantthepotato nope its worded exactly as when you obtain castorice you obtain the global buff
personally i have no issue with castorices passive as someone who is pulling for cas myself i see the passive as pretty much useless unless youre a newer player you shouldnt even be dying in combat so often thus her passive will rarely even be used at all the only issue with this implementation is the precedent it brings in potentially releasing game breaking passives in the future which is an issue for a lot of the player base as it could lead to future characters being pw though i honestly dont have an issue with this either i dont really care if theyre gonna add more global buffs i dont care if they release anything game breaking im still pulling for cas and would definitely pull for phainon ill still be playing the game even if it leans towards a more pw future i love the game and ive invested a lot in it to suddenly just boycott people who are boycotting and complaining have to realise that there are people who wont care and will support whatever hoyo does and to me thats okay like how its also okay to hate what the game and company has and will become
still fine if allies at hp dont get immunity and if the effect only works once per battle its only useful for cyclers and skill issue players the real problem is that it works even if she isnt in the team and if future characters will also get global passives
global passives arent a problem only if a is unique lets say to anniversary characters or b provides a niche buff that is conditionally useful castorices global passive itself is mid as hell only really useful to those zerocyclers and for tanking a boss special move once the former of which isnt really that special just a small qol to sustainless comps granting them an extra turn which could alleviate some cycle clears failing and the latter being somewhat a skill issue if you let the boss do their special move youre doing something wrong there is always if not most of the time a proper mechanic you have to deal with in order to not get nuked by the boss and if the boss has no special move you are not dying if you have a proper sustain ok if you die to overworld mobs i hate to break it to you but thats a skill issue if its to bosses what i said above will apply properly read and use the boss mechanic to your advantage while yes its quite a dangerous precedent to the future characters do note that saying flat out omg castorice has a global passive now everyone else js gonna get them is a big slippery slope fallacy and has no current proofs supporting it this is also why a exists if its unique there wouldnt be the problem of having to pull everyone for their global passive i see jokes about ok guys everyone has a global passive or whatever and while they are somewhat funny its a big slipperly slope to say that theyd go and add this when there arent any proofs that support it and no powercreep is not a supporting proof for the global passive powercreep is a phenomenon that affects almost all games and is not a supporting proof because of its definition lets start with that the formal definition of powercreep is increase the power of a relatively new unit over old units in order to make the old unit feel less relevant no older unit will feel less relevant with the addition of this passive bailu now you have two revives instead of one fu xuan e same thing two revives instead of one
this is why i saved up for her
who support this only dum people
a must have character because of its passive do they always die on endgame content i smell skill issue
i think im getting acherons e
i feel like if its only in overworld content its fine and it dosent affect higher tier and game content
c barbara has a revive but shes generally not top tier lol
hsr and genshin fandom are the worse
where were these guys when they forced us to pull firefly ruan mei and even madam herta many of us skippedlost they made us regret not getting these characters
i just wish it was only when she was on ur team
well guess what hyacine is rumored to have a global passive and she has an ability locked behind her lc keep giving them your money and theyll keep screwing you over like this
i find it so hilarious that people seem to forget that hsr is a gacha game like it or not stuff like this is pretty normal in gacha especially for an anniversary character but i guess thats one of the downsides of trying to conceal it as a regular game like hoyo does i think if people got over the utterly lame and boring superbreak mechanic which is when i quit they can also get over this people just like to complain especially the fp and husbando enjoyers xd
i actually like it and welcome it i understand the frustration behind it but this doesnt bother me at all and again i like it its just a game anyways and shouldnt be taken that seriously yall can argue with me and point out whatever u want but again its just a game and u can find something else that will satisfy u more
this passive must work only when cas is in the team if it works outside the team is ia awful and predatory
cant wait for the character who is functionally useless in battle but has a global passive that buffs atk by
i just hope these global passives dont become too impactful cuz wdym we could have a global passive where cd or cr is increased i hope they limit these to specific characters or else we be walking around with a character that clears hoolay and nikador for you without having to be in the team
blade why u make me suffer
must i remind you that bilu does the same thing
and then when more and more x and x characters come out with global passives then at x and x we can get them for free with the new currencies if assuming they give out one every anniversary and more cuz they mentioned they will give another one for free this year its just average gacha game hsr is a gacha game they want money and they already been so generous
how does it work when she is not in the team
what do you mean the game is designed to be pay to win
imagine innovating not in gameplay but in gacha
its lore accurate then why trailblazer is not as strong as the cutscene suggest and why a literal black hole blade that can trap soul orbital cannon and etc barely do anything to literally anyone lore accurate arguments can be a double edged swords thats why i mostly use them for jokes and hsr balance is always a jokes
now imagine this revival turns into crit damage boost or rate or speed boost every character should be obtained then or your teams that u built will be useless in the next patch thats a problem the game was fun because it allows u to finish content with what u have and be creative not what u buy
hear me out normal hsr players think that no endgame content is hard
simple dont pull or dont play the game
the problem isnt even the passive reviving is kind of useless if we have a descending sustain the problem is that this leaves room for today to do the same thing to future characters
people keep saying that this will ruin hsr well first of all this is bs because its not like this is a multiplayer or a pvp game i dont personally see a problem with it it my be kind of op but keep in mind that the characters will be on hp meaning that in most situations they would probably be dead either way on the next turn and if not they would eventually die from the lack of hp i understand peoples concerns but come on power creep is something that couldnt be escaped either way in games like this its inevitable besides fp does not mean all stars and star weapons im a free to play and i barely play on my account but for example i can clear moc up to stage hsr devs are being generous enough
not as op as you still need to be healed or you can say bye bye to your characters that castorice revived
bro why are people complaining about it being too broken i havent killed my characters a single time this update and im fp
ill continue to play the game but i for sure will never pay a single penny on it ever again
i mean its fair cuz of the lore plus if u rlly want her then try to get her
saying this is fair because its justified by the lore is like saying hsr is entitled to your money because a gacha player is supposed to be spending to support a gacha game
ive been talking about this on reddit with the others and someone had the idea that perhaps its just a qol feature specific to a few characters that eventually gets dropped in favour of something else kind of like how acheron feixiao and maybe ff have a qol for pretty much instakilling mobs its amazing but ultimately not the thing that will determine the future of your account edit and remember back when acheron was the first and only one to do this people were also angry about the qol powercreep and how they have to pull acheron despite not liking her just to make farming mobs easier i myself was inclined to pull her but then feixiao came along who i was gonna pull anyway and who can take care of mobs in a similar fashion im really hoping that to be the case here too that this batch of characters have the special stars with niche but kinda useful global passives to make them more unique and tempting and thats that because in itself castorices passive is okay it needs a sustain to work well and in case a sustain is on the team most people probably arent dying anyways and if they do because they struggle with sustain chances are the revive wont help them unless theyre like one hit away from winning without sustain it only applies to sustainless runs which is usually done by more skilled players with better built characters anyway it can be useful there to combat bad rng once but only once cutting down the attempts from idk to overall my opinion is that castorices passive isnt all that great in practice its a cool qol but there are few times when it will actually impact your performance in a significant amount like as said when youre one hit away from winning when your dps gets knocked down if all passives are similar instead of being just flat out universal stat boosts then i think this could be something unique and fun the problem comes if they do start producing characters that just boost stats for now ill choose to try and be positive enjoy the game and its new characters get back into the story and hope hoyo handles global passives in a good way rather than going the pure greed route
i like how most comments here make it sound like there characters always die in battles come on lets be honest ppl either have lingsha fu xuan luocha adventurine in the team at this point in game
i think it works with her law
it wouldnt be much of a deal if she was just an op character that will stay in meta for long like how furina is a huge support and can also walk over the water infinitely but the fact she is most likely going to get powercrepted in two or three patches is the major issue when phainon cyrene or even marchs new form come out she will no longer be as good just like what happened with acheron and firefly
slippery slope fallacy technically this global passive isnt that egregious but what about for future characters it could lead to permanent stat bonuses for all characters on an account essentially forcing players to pull for a character they do not want if they want to clear most endgame especially with older characters this is bad the power creep is completely off the rails in star rail instead of power creeping characters hoyo is power creeping entire accounts with this one in the not too distant future
grimmreapgi the issue has never been its power it is the precedent it sets time revive at hp is nowhere near op anyone complaining about that is stupid where it does matter is that castorice sets a precedent for hoyoverse to add more busted shit like stat and talent level ups in global passives on limited time characters where the way to acquire them is through a factual gambling system hsr past the early updates has never had the players have an issue with dying the global passive is a anti consumer practice that hoyo is gping to be using to squeeze more money out of characters after all whats more valuable than a character that does stuff on the bench if hoyo really wants to put in global passives for the quality of life or health of the game then they can easily put it on the mc they have various different forms to do that but they dont they will put the passives on a select few units if you want an example of this thing happening just look at how fast hoyoverse implented new characters on par with acherons damage only a couple of patches after her release
there is more ready before x finish speed up crit rate and damage up talent level up these are gonna release in x if castorice doesnt cause problem within community
extrastuffboxofaksaklk source im looking at leaks leakers all the time but havent seen anyone say anything of the sort id like to check the credibility of whoever leaked it before i believe it
extrastuffboxofaksaklk yeah ive seen that leaks too but if that leak will be changed than im relieved since im not sure will have enough luck and jade for all of em
anyway for me acheron insta kill better since it was faster even though it drain more tp but that doesnt really matter unless youre is sudu hard mode
ugh where did my reply go d yt is at it again anyway source please
there is no way hoyo is stopping this trend at one unit do not trust this company
user so youre having same problem with me too youtube also often doesnt let me send a reply anyways for the leaks i know about the upcoming gp were from uncle titanoboa but its different from what theyve said its atk spdmax hp and trace i forgot if it was talentskill of memosprite and basic attack evel up
yes and its so annoying its also removing the person who im ing i can see it while i make the reply then i send and poof its gone and so is the comment so buggy ugh thanks i like to check the track record of the leakers before i choose to believe it there are some leakers out there who seem to be part of the engimata and just straight up making things up lol being cautious doesnt hurt but atm i dont feel like doomposting whatever isnt confirmed
user i guess yorue right it removed your right now
completely agree with all of this castorices global passive isnt that great but its not her global passive everyones worrying about its future global passives which could defeat the purpose of hsr being a turn based strategy game
bro this is the best amount of logic and reason ive seen in these comments holy shit finally a person who isnt a sociopathic karen acting like the russian government
well your comment makes sense but sadly those salty people wont hear u just enjoy the game
queen_myrrh the thing is it actually helps people who really struggle st end game content i mean i cant max clear any of the endgame modes due to lack of decent relics after farming like crazy and everytbing being e except the standards these global passives literally just make my existing cast stronger if i decide to get them and give me a better shot at content with these passives they can somewhat counter how weak past characters have become yet these passives are tied to the characters
anbuassasine if they didnt inflate the hp i bet youd be fine without the global passive but because they wanna make money i guess they have to make harder content so everyone will spend money on their new top tier characters to clear more content i use to be able to clear end game content till the hp inflation now i cant cause i refuse to pull for the new trash theyre putting out
it is okay just please only if she is in the team
wdym barbara c and qiqi c both have a revive in their cons
lmao lore accurate is so most stupid thing to say from those balls lickers i mean when you want lore accurate just gave us buff went we finish the story no need to pull for the in game passive that is lore accurate
the entire thing is its hp and its usually gonna happen on enemy turns or your healers turn is blocked by enemies meaning its not that good honestly it would suck in endgame cuz pretty much everything is multi target aswell and if anyone calls me coping or a shill im not trust ne i thought about this for a bit
she is a unique character and she must have unique talents
just no ive said it before im not putting up with it no thanks
x normal day
lore accurate doesnt even matter here when blade is literally immortal but can die this is a problem for the future with what other bs global passives they can get away with people shouldnt spend on castorices banner to really let hoyo know we hate this but ccs will be ccs and people will spend because they dont care about the games future really sad
hoyo twitter is so fuckin funny i know that its browkn but yall dont need to complain abt her passive since its apart of lore it aint powercreep ok it might be but castorice is so fucking beautiful
as a long time variety gacha player global statseffects and skills are not new the only difference is in most games such stuff can be accessed by players in some kind of fp way that only requires grinding quests achievements etc hsr on the otherhand is selling such thing through a character this greed is equivalent to genshins double new character banner of mavuikacitlali at the same time actually much worse as if this global passive bs succeeds future hsr characters will have more crazier global passives that fps would curse on why such thing exists as they cannot get everything meaning not having such characters is already a gap vs accounts that have said character now the excuse is well its a single player turn based gacha game why bother about accounts well i wont bother debunking such excuses any further as such players are probably the same ones that supports stuff like the mavuika citlali banners explaining things to such people are pointless
its not a problem and not a game breaking ability quit the game stop playing if you think that literally cant have any fun in this game
i saw her design i pull idk if she broken or not i been saving for her since i saw the design people honestly that has been playing long can just pull who ever and clear all the content idk whats so hard about that that said the game is indeed unbalance which i agree and its hsr tactic but overall does it effect me and enjoyment level no i dont need cycles a game that i play for fun and its not competition will i still post feedback on how the game is unbalanced of course but will i make drama out of it no
i dont get what yall even consider paywin like if they shouldnt get perks like this if they pay what are they even winning then and its not anyones fault but yours you can definitely get her freeplay her leaks were all over the place and you can totally save up this patch
or maybe dont pull for her if you dont want to
already uninstalled im done with the predatory tactics and max greed
what do i think its a dogshit really its not castos fault nor her op kit and revive passive and obv not her look she is cute and beautiful but the very global passive existence itself causes a bad premise for future game development there might be another char with another global passhit in the future with this one exist
its lore accurate tho
we just need more res options
dont forget how many pulls we get in
its not that op most oldbie casual player dont care about this passive because their team rarely die
true whoever is crying are just the ones u dont have pulls to pull her and if they really release more characters with global passive i will pull them too lol
bibekdasyymg dumb as hell this is the equivalent of a whale telling fp players they suck because their characters arent e s and able to cycle moc
whats the lore of next global passive characters
as i play more for building the characters and watching their animations i actually like the idea of buffs that would not require a character on the team i would have to pull a character i possibly dont like bummer but at least i wouldnt have see them ex for me it would be preferable if robin had some of her kit in a form of global passive so that i wouldnt lose that much by not having her on my team since i deslike pretty much everything about her especially the chords pop song i want to enjoy the audible aspect of the game when i play
this is not a problem lol
im sure they are not gonna do this willynilly castorice giving this ability is fitting but for others its not as clear yet im sure they are not gonna tag this onto characters without giving an actual lore reason for it
frankly the only problem is that its global as a feature its not broken they could just have made it unable to be activated in end game mods
its whatever on its own it makes me wonder if later on could we stack multiple off team passives
even though you only get hp it still feels like this will make the game too easy and unfair to people who dont have her if we complain enough would it be possible for them to make it optional
honestly since having aventurine my team rarely dies
if they make endgame harder so that its only possible with the new op character ms thats where the problem really starts to get on my nerves others im completely fine with this
newfriends complain about meta and mustpulls lol lmao welcome to gacha gaming
forcing them to pull no one is forcing you to pull
imagine phainon gives global crit rate buff
i bet people will get over it after castorice is released just like every patch so far
thank god i quit hoyo games they have been getting desperate and its showing star rail is probably the most expensive to play way too many characters power creep is out of control blatantly ignoring play styles to milk meta slaves at the expense of casual players and now the castorice global revive that just forces players to either pull or bust and would mean the future for gacha will get worse and much more predatory
even if i dont really care about power creepthings but this passive is just weird and what about the future characters there is the first global passive and it will come the second third and so on i can accept it if it work only when cas is in that team now the dev is really playing with players patience
i personally think the hate is incredibly overblown castorices passive is incrediblely niche in its application as if you are in a situation where a character is dying once youre already in state that proves that you arent fit for whatever content youre in it might be a safety net for sloppy play but provides no increase in actual combat strength if anything this is the logical progression of hsrs power scaling it is a gatcha game and characters do need to be doing something new to remain profitable and with how vastly limited the combat system is in hsr this is a pretty decent direction to take
how tf she is must pull we have great sustains like aventurine lingsha that almost prevent us from death dying in moc rn is either your build or skill issues
is it just me who finds the people who are complaining stupid its hp reminder hp what can you do with hp it so stupid and people are acting like it is the end of the world and you have to pull her no you dont because trust me new gens the next patchs shell be powercreeped i mean look at sparkle
i dont care she looks cool
i kinda hope i could toggle this global passive off i want castorice but i want to relive the frustration i felt at prenerf deer
if this was going to be a one off thing they should have given the player base a free copy like they did with dr ratio hell theyre giving either luocha or ruan mei for free and adding characters to the standard banner so we can pick them for our yearly reset but if this global passive is going to continue onward then damn already we have new five stars every patch and now theyre adding these busted units as well stars dont even feel special anymore
this this is literally how people should view her passive just a safety net and literally nothing else
precisely also doesnt it only work if your character is healed in the next turn
fwuffcat from every report ive seen yes and only once per battle and only if the character is healed before their next turn it sounds nice at a glance but its use case is so restrictive i cant imagine it really being good for much especially outside of teams that use castorice and have their hp constantly on the low end
okay but this is a problem cause zz and genshin power creep problem is non existent so they know how to do it but they just choose not to and you are missing the point of what it means for the future and this could eventually be another ruan mei situation where in time it will become basically essential cause of how they decided to shift the meta and im sorry global passives is not a good direction to take cause we now know its gonna open the floor gates how long till spd atk crit auto healing passives its just gonna make everything pointless at this point the path system is already terrible cause they just threw that out the window so i just need to understand why defend such a bad implementation
im_motivatedayato yes but it sets the precedent for new global passives
teddyisaliar i mean with the way hsr is going with powercreep already i cant say im not worried about what global passive means for the future of meta because what is going to be so hard to fight that i need a revive i stand by my point this particular global passive probably isnt going to be the make or break of a persons account but if this keeps going its safe to assume that it will be much harder without a unit with such a passive
darkos why are you hiding comments
lets be reminded that we are playing a gacha game we are playing a free game that needs a profit to keep the game running
honestly who gives af if you dont like it then skip the character really that simple
barbara nana bailu youre a worthy necromancer welcome to the squad
lore accurate who created that lore then
hsr has really gone downhill sigh
its not that castorices passive is broken but rather the future implication the passive itself is not actually that broken tbh bailu already has something similar but the fact that any team can have is more concerning the whole thing couldve been avoided by literally just having castorice being on the team for it to activate and removing the obtaining part but nah hoyo really pushing the boundarys
if its based off a lore why dont they make like jing yuan have global passive too their excuse is kinda pointless
im getting her no debate
one of the livestream topic that didnt stick out in the spotlight is the animation the devs said that theyll start putting in character trailers level animation in the game which is a good thing imo almost feels like in hird again
im not going to sugarcoat it she is waifu bait she is too op she powercreeps literally all other dpss and hoyo wants to make her revenue as good as possible by nerfing anaxa and making him good but completely mid so that castorice fans can still argue that anaxa isnt completely ignored by hoyo to some extent
i loose on mydei and finally garunteed castorice
im good with that its a mostly useless passive so it doesnt matter even if it sets a precedent for future passives theyre probably not gonna matter just like this one still pulling for my purple woman
doesnt bailu do the same though shes able to revive one party member once per match too
its not really that powerful in my opinion it can only be used once per battle and it revives on hp so the character might get killed again before they can be healed
typical hoyo
im temporarily fucking done with hsr i aint logging in for weeks so i can qualify for the returnee game did nothing but to piss me off this gives me more time into playing wuthering waves and warframe ill only play genshin just for events and dailies with little less playtime fuck that shit too
this will have a sure survival if u mess up in moc or du run but so long its a one time revive and hp stay to hp im not worry much what i do worried is the posibilities of future character will do same as this passive global
why peeps are like this its not like this is genshin who only give less than pulls free for each minor updatethis is hsr where you have at least pulls each updateand anniversary will be pulls free as in literal free that you only need to sign in and im not including the rewards from events so for me castorice is really a given character too along with ruan mei or luocha plus this is just a trial thing again for whatever they plan for emiyaim sure all battles will look like echo of war for his global passive
my team dies and get revived sec later the boss uses fup attack
or maybe you should think about why female characters having op powers bothers you so much arent yall the same ones who praise male characters for their skills while crying about how mid female charas are yall wanna cry sexism now when all youre doing is hating on every female character that comes out calling her waifu bait while youre the ones gooning to lads and whining about more male characters all while simping over fanart and declaring why male charas are better shut up at this pointyall just dont want women anywhere near you it only gets to a point before yall start finding dumb excuses like this as if this hasnt happened before with male charas arent yall the exact people crying for husbandos also i never saw you when dehya kit was declared mid was she nerfed as well for alhaitham to remain a good dendro dps no right see how stupid you sound
childefan grass touch it
because is to deterr fp from pulling artoria because is a once in a lifetime banner and the revenue in that banner will be split from type moon and mihoyo because those with artoria will boost their account of worth
childefan sexist im not being sexist girls are proven to sell better just facts
besides ive never played lads before
childefan most male characters for some reason have been doomed to be in the second phase of the banner which we all know is going to mean hoyoverse is going to ignore them to oblivion this has consistently happened ever since dhils banner and only temporarily ended with sundays banner but still even the future male characters after sunday have been doomed to second phase of the banner we arent going to forget what happened to mydei who was supposed to be a powerful unit got bricked by hoyo with his automated attack during his turns in his enhanced state now anaxa isnt even beating jade in terms of subdps who mind you is supposed to be the hertas bis support next to tribbie and his buff are negligible his solo dps got nerfed despite having the intentions in his kit if they keep bricking the men the fandom will still be in gaslit into thinking male characters dont sell well in gacha games yeah on a game where kit outweighs the actual charactersdesigns characterization etc themselves making them foreshadowed with shitty kit will obviously make then underperformed in banner sales i dont hate female characters i pull for them too due to likelinessi got tribbie after the trailblaze quest but if this keeps up then yeah people will complain though it is what as you said filled with unsavory and misogynistic undertones
childefan off ur meds
link but artoria will be a skin the gacha is shirou
lovingorilla no im sane fortunately unlike you you have got to be kidding me if you think criticism and hate is similar in any fcking way i want more male characters too but the way the fandom goes about it is plain icky yall were simping for mydei because hes half naked but varesa has a short skirt so shes automatically waifu bait also lesbians exist its not only the male fans being serviced like you guys love to claim as an excuse to dismiss a fenale character and refuse to see past her appearanceyall just want to sexualize men too lets not play victim and claim to see only one side of the coin hoyo definitely needs to do better but my problem is with people like you who hate being in the vicinity of women online like did yall not see the absolutely senseless hate train for jade chascarappa and even varesa now you can also count in castorice now too the comments are not criticism for company but filled with hate and misogynistic intent always bashing women charas like ohh why does she have a kitty i dont like charas with kitty etc i have actually seen such exact comments its plain weird how in the big year of youre going to seriously tell me im insane for defending women like have we fallen that far as a community did yall not see how the only time hsr fanbase was happy recently was during sundays banner all the girls i repeat all the girls were hated just because they had a banner before sunday yall are delusional if you think what youre doing is right and feminist or whatever
fugue literally also had the same fate being released alongside sunday she was heavily nerfed from her original kit when it wasnt even that broken and just good while sunday kept getting buffed powercreeping all the other harmony units making fugue seem a luxury unit while sunday becoming a metamusthave unit did anyone say shit yes quite a bunch of players did they do anything no
she aint better than herta what are u talking about
no all i see is a person who goons to lads themselves plays yandere sim and simps over castorice and firefly
kallaroid was this comment supposed to target me asking just in case since i dont want to cook someone for a misunderstanding
link deter like in patches in the future where the fps can save more
if you think this is worse wait until honkais marysue elysia variant cyrene gets introduced later hoyo break the lore just for her alone
miraufie what do you mean they break the lord just for her
miraufie what do you mean they break the lore just for her
mikowhackingei how about aventurine phainon
xeenoo hoyo wanted to make her thronelevel emanator that is more powerful than emanators like acheron and herta all because she is their beloved marysue child in the game the power level is aeon emanator pathstrider but hoyo added a special level just for her below aeon but above emanator oh and they will introduce new combat mechanic just for her too
foxyuushaz phainon has potential like sunday to be in first banner well see but aventurine he was closer to being an anniversary unit of course hell get special treatment
miraufie did they already reveal her kit
xeenoo it is leaks beware
xeenoo not yet but hopefully they will scrape that she is better off as npc since hoyo will make her op just because she is their beloved mary sue
mikowhackingei anaxa is the anni unit and look at what they did to him
mikowhackingei is she a remembrance
childefan she did not compare them by gender i mean waifu bait is kinda popular for gacha games nowadays same with husbando bait so theres nothing to do with gender imo waifu bait is the same with husbando bait gender war are going crazy nowadays huh
miraufie emanator of what
esmondgoh exactly these people act as if the existence of a female character is fan service how in the hell is nahida fan service people who have these thoughts about them are more at fault here but of course the fandom yearns for men men and only men why should they bother to have common sense that a child character can exist without being weird or an object for some gratification of kinks cant remember the last time a fandom was ever happy with a female character its like everywhere i go all i see is men better btw i like xxx man character more xxxis my bbg and proceed to hate on the actual bbg character like what if yall want to spend on only boys to date and ship go play dating sims or other gacha games like lads or obey me or whatever why bring this bs into rpg games a genre where apart from hoyo games all other games are male centric didnt see anyone complaining then
xeenoo of fuli but her status is higher than acheron and herta
lovingorilla off your job wait you dont have one do you neither do you have common sense
miraufie is there an explanation why lore wise
xeenoo not sure i havent seen of any info on it yet
mikowhackingei so were just assuming it
childefan oh youre so right about this
childefan look at you crying when you have a harem of billion girls insecure regardless of the sea of waifu u have gonna burn husbando lover houses
childefan your ignorance is showing calling people sexist without them even being sexist is wild
childefan oh wait nvm i read it wrong sorry for misunderstanding
nothing you have said even correlates to her being waifu bait youre basically saying any strong character whos a female is a waifu bait
miraufie she was blessed by death that does not make her op at all though that just makes her an exception
miraufie and how is she a mary sue shes bound to be alone since she kills anything she comes in contact with a marysue is an authors insert meaning freakishly op no flaws and always loved by everyone shes not that
miraufie also shes from a place with very different laws compared to the rest of the universe
miraufie she was never stated to be an emanator she was just stated to be blessed by death
userzy have you seen dr ratio or mydei or sunday are you saying those dont appeal to women
userzy or is that out of the question since castorice is strong
tyutyururu read my comments properly i was talking about cyrene not castorice and you will find out what castorice really is in there is a reason why she can understand and talk to the titans
xeenoo nothing hoyo wanted to make cyrene op because her hi counterpart is their beloved child
miraufie i thought it was kiana
xeenoo elysia seemed to have replaced that position
miraufie oh im sorry i didnt see that but i still think kiana is the favorite elysia is just very lore important
miraufie and since were talking about flamechasers yes youre right
tyutyururu but that is hi if they are trying to force the same thing here it might backfire instead since they wanted to put her above the fanfavorite acheron and herta hoyo cant seem to understand that not everyone is into hi nor would this make people want to like hi due to the blatant favoritism the horrible way they treated it
miraufie according to who tourists
xeenoo according to hoyo japanese game magazine interview they are going to slowly merge hsr world with hi fans did not like this because they wanted hsr to be a standalone series as for the elysia thing it was very obvious no oh it was hi players who said that and i doubt they are tourist seeing as it has less playerbase than other hoyo games internationally
esmondgoh while ff was treated better than a lot of characters in this game her animation is lackluster af and guess what hoyo fixed about it a slightly better bg wow it doesnt matter even if we complain cz ppl are too busy blaming each other instead of hoyo and their incompetence
ff was given better treatment because she was based on shaojis girlfriend lol
i still wish anaxas able to do good damage honestly i need a new wind dps since my blade isnt doing his job properly
miraufie shes ice remembrance iirc but shell increase speed afaik i feel like shell replace rmc
miraufie honestly i want hsr to be its own world like i know its honkai but just please cant we have two seperate worlds for once i hope they balance cyrene
i agree with your comment im tired seeing hyv always favor the female characters more but yeah not surprised anymore since their main target audience are mostly the incels men
youtubeisntallowingmetocom no way they will balance her lol she is hoyos fav child they will make her stronger and have higher status than normal emanators like acheron and herta i dont know if she will be ice remembrance though march th sp will be one and like castorice she too will have global passive unfortunately hoyo already mentioned in thrir interview last year that they will slowly merge hsr with hi they really are that desperate to force people to playlike hi
kallaroid imagine being mad a female has a powerful kit average female in hoyo fandoms
kallaroid complaining about waifu bait when you are probably gooning to male characters is insane its like females shouldnt exist
bang_ladon except this female character is hoyos mary sue she will be given special treatment just because of that if she is given the same treatment as acheron or herta nobody would get angry but just because she is the variant of hoyos beloved child she alone will be received such treatment she hasnt even done anything worthwhile beside stealing meis place by phainons side whatever her special treatment is should have been given to march instead
miraufie do you even know her lore in hi kinda curious
 i know and i also know that she is shaojis waifu but that is hi he shouldnt have brought her to hsr he really didnt learn anything from firefly
miraufie i dont really see the problem about them slowly merging hsr world with his both games already have a direct connection because of welt and tbh it was going to happen eventually regardless because theyll need to progress welts plot id it all depends on how they execute it if theyre able to make that its not necessary to play hi to properly understand hsr like how it currently is then that would be great but if they go for the other route that theyre desperate to attract more players to hi then that would be pretty shitty move
fishman thats the problem they are desperate to attract more players to play hi since hi is hoyos beloved game hence why they are slowly merging both worlds seeing as vita became member of masked fools after they added sparkle there i wouldnt be surprise if they will add vita to hsr in the future to attract players to hi and they expect hsr players to go check hi for characters lores for the variants added in hsr shitty move alright
miraufie as a hi fan id say that at this point they should just stop trying and just make hi if they want to attract players the main reasons why they couldnt get players into hi is because of how old it is even after part and seeing how much the game is behind newer games and how the plot is going in part along with the fact that this game has a female only character roster wouldnt attract the general audience even though they have male characters that have perfect potential to be playable like kevin welt otto kalpas etc i know theyre partially playable in the story but theyre actual playable characters that you can use in combat and stuff and male characters like zhongli blade neuvillette etc did attract a lot of people to genshin and hsr and im saying this as a dude myself i had no internet in genshin until i saw zhongli and thought dang this dude looks pretty sick id honestly like that hoyo just makes hi that continues whatever the hell theyre trying to do and either eos hi and create an offline version that doesnt include gacha for like or something or leave it in the state like how they left ggz or the most unlikely one eos the game then make a full fledge aa remake that streamlines the story give adam an actual personality and probably make aphos writing better and also have playable male characters because they didnt have to put this much effort into them if you cant even play them
fishman isnt that why hsr existed in the first place they couldnt add playable male characters in hi because the cn male players got angry at the thought of their waifu cheating on them even adam got hated because of that no so they created a new honkai game but this time with male playable characters added from the start instead since hoyo loves hi very much they should just focus on making hi good instead of forcing hsr players to go and play hi instead amphoreus is boring because it is a rehash of elysian realm all over again with cyrene of course being the god i heard that the next planet would be edo star so we will be seeing the sakura of hsr speaking of adam i dont mind hoyo porting him to hsr he would be much better in hsr than in hi so long as they dont mistreat him like they did with phainon that is
miraufie allegedly thats one of the reasons why they created hsr but hsr was in development around the same time as genshin so they probably just thought that might as well should make this game mixed gendered as well from the get go especially since the protagonist that they just designed is male and that they are bringing welt into it adam did get a lot of hate from cn players so hoyo tried to please them by making him into a generic self insert and stripped away his personality remnants of it are still present in it game especially with his interactions with lyle they ended up shooting themselves in the foot because of this as cn players still disliked him and people who wanted male characters were disappointed fortunately the fanbase developed a personality for him like how persona fans developed a personality for their mcs by the dialogue options obviously this ended up in two types of groups one who claim that adam is a harem protagonist and the other that everyone loves that the dude is just chasing after the paycheck if hoyo were to port him to hsr theyd have to give him a proper personality so id like him to use whatever they were originally planning for him add the paycheck joke that fans created and not have some sort of relation with mei in this case acheron id like him to be a character who can stand on his own
bang_ladon yeah as a woman im so embarassed and appalled at the height of internalized misogyny in these people they never would have complained about a supposedly op character if it was a male and it would only make them simp for him more these girls are basically femcels similar to the chinese incels who cant stand the existence of their gender in a game they just dont want to admit they dont like seeing their fav man with women classic mentality of women whose mund have ingrained fandom culture so much jealousy and contempt for a fictional character all these women need to get a life if they think this female op character is in any way a huge issue
a_renns ah of course the same female characters that get absolutely sidelined by the fandom and hated on from day one for simply existing are fanservice and privileged got it how does your mind work is your mother also fan service btw are you isnt your existence itself appealing to men and hence youre automatically fan service that wasnt meant to exist see how absolutely braindead you sound a female character having op skill set is not privilege or fan service by your logic mydei is a conservatively oriented and appeals to only men too right since hes so obviously fan service and popular too with a great role to play in the story how truly dumb are you im actually quite concerned for people with your way of thinking if it bothers you soo much maybe just go play lads you know no straight boy or supposed incel is playing that game to be able to disturb your experience stop playing hoyo games all this whining for naught
the reason hsr gives more pulls is because they release twice as many characters
you clearly have not even opened the wishing menu right why do you think pulls mean anything when there are banners running at the same time compared to how many banners run they should give us to guarantee atleast of the characters
wait do people think pulls an update is generous wow
im just do daily job and out event dont even do this game not full time play game my full time is genshin so i dont care shjt
idk feels similar to pneuma and ousia in fontaine including abyss and travel mechanic in natlan
im so glad i dont play hsr anymore it quickly became pay to win you cant really play the game without and some quickly get powercrept by newer ones
who dont like hsr just go quit and delete ez
me who doesnt care about global pasive and just want her dragon be likeyeah i dont care about the pasive just aim for her dragon
future relic sets be like pc when wearer hails from amphoreus increase atk by and max hp by pc when wearer hails from amphoreus increase crit rate and crit dmg by and separately
just roll for her what ever or dont and dont get the passive if u dont need it isnt different from meta or waifu do what u want dont throw a tantrum over a new mechanic
yeah i already knew this kind of ability gonna exist sooner or later we already have the blue shield buy doing this
just fucking play the game
single pull luck dont fail me now
plot twist hoyo gave castorice this global passive so that weird tiktok player finally can beat something like aventurine or feixiao in the story or later nikador xd
they might get away with being faithful the her lore as a queen of death or whatev to justify the passive but as a first implementer other dev studios will take notes and consider implementing it which is a serious concern
nah this is just favoritism by hoyo
i only pull for castorice because i fell in love with her
those who conplaining about this have you even play worst pay to win game u mean real pay to win game
people who defend it because of the lore are stoopid the problem isnt that its not lore accurate its that it forces you to pull for her it would have been better to give the passive to anyone who completed a certain quest like literally any rpg would have done
for me her passive skill even not in party is considered too op it may match the lore but that excuse is horrible justifying anything by using lore is terrible move if theres characters that the lore tell us about hisher undefeated streaks and the skill make you win anyway then why we need to play dont be a smart a tell me that her skill isnt pay to win because it just revived you etc you knew what i mean this is also cause the problem with designing challenge imagine they consider this skill as requirements to perform well in challenges then other whom havent her will be suffer i would suggest to let her buff team just for a bit instead it doesnt effect gameplay much and still benefits whom have her and for tactic revenue i believe we had already seen this kind of tactic before but guess what no one care that much and let it pass for some reason even its clearly
i think i understand now why its such an issue but for castorices case its going to be a skill issue if you die you can always restart the encounter anyway and you need to recieve healing or a shield to properly revive so if you are thinking of going sustainless then its not going to work i might sound tone deaf but i dont care
i have given up on hsr the global passive breaks the game
not like they forcing you to get her like i dont mind her global passive idk why people are mad but im pretty chill with it like ive had a few fight where my character was down in one shot and ngl having her or not is good either way and change the team comp a bit more
kiwee sure and whats wrong with that if other dev studios pick it up whats wrong with that literally nada
im_motivatedayato cause powercreep is already pretty big issue in hoyo games and if they get away with stuff like this whats stopping others to just implement something that will crank that powercreep to
if other dev are taking notes as someone who plays crk im cooked
shreggy that games powercreep is already concerning lmfao
spiashh fr like if they gonna add global passive trough character since global passive were already exist via laboratory idk what they gonna cook maybe insta kill or something crazier
expect hsr was never meant to be one
why would you let hsr slowly become like those game you realized that this is the beginning of a bad trend power creep will only get worse and the game will become more pay to win
for me this is a huge help idc about what yall say castorice is good addition to my lineups
people are fearing for something that will happen in future i dont play hsr but its funny to see the current state of the community especially when they felt do superior to other gacha games when it released this is what happens once the fanbase got stable after release and no game is generous for players experience these companies are only generous because its their marketing
its not really that big of a deal its not like you can suddenly play sustainless and not get punished for it you still need a healer in your team which doesnt change much compared to how team building works previously sure you can argue that it sets a bad example for future character like having x character would give you permanent def ignore even if that character is not in your team but i think hoyo knows it too that if they do that it wont end well for now castorice ability imo is alright its not meta breaking or anything its just a cool side bonus
why are people glazing it in the pretense its so cool being lore accurate i get theres moments where thats good but theres more serious matters that take priority if people hadnt grown up with these kinds of games maybe thered be hope to reject these practices but at this point only the government can do something gachas heavily manipulates you with dopamine rewards incentives theyve brainwashed the population its over for the common folk and they literally lost the capacity to think
but we have another character who revives fallen teammates
even if she has a revive passive still wont pull for her
what people here doing endgame modes cycles with no sustains and say that it makes endgames easier grow up
the interesting part about all this the only people complaining is the west
one of reasons why i stopped playing hsr around month ago when i saw leaks
if yall are complaining about her then dont sommon for her simple as that
i want to get castorice but the global revive bothers me cause i dont know if ill be able to turn off the passive manually i like my risky teams that end with a character at health
if they going to add more global passive in the future they should just add it to every character and limit the amount of global passive that can be used
people hate her cuz they cant get her
if it was amphoreus only whatever but yeah this could be a grim start to a worse future
devs we will give free irrelevant star char just to forget about this we will also buff old char after patch so you can stay on the hook and spend more money i can see a new yatch and nuke reactor for dawey
wait wait wait not on the team what is this bullshit
until there is a global buff that boost damage i dont really think its ganna be that much of a headache
its horse armor all over again
even if its following the lore its a bit too much to have i would accept if there is limitation to such mechanic such as limiting to just available on amphoreus ground or amphoreus in nature when facing amphoreus enemies for example consider this thanatos is a titan on amphoreus and has no influence to the cosmos outside at least not yet
let us all admit hoyo likes to power creept all new characters
you wont even see people who would disagree if everyone can just get her for free only a small amount of people would complain because the main problem will always be the gamble on getting her
people now just fear the problem that doesnt exist they are treating like you need a certain character to hop on the game or else you are going to lose all their bank account ooo what if they pull out a sub dps passive so they are saying we will not be using the on field character in the future to battle in a turn base game the people that complaining is either a severe gambling addict or people that brag you about them getting shirt for
hoyo made mavuika an event months after her banner ended if you had mavuika the event was easy it was tailored for her abilities otherwise even if you are a whale you might have failed do you really think star rail wont have a future boss that needs the passive
no one hates her they hate the global passive feature
now all the future star characters must have a global passive or else they suck
the shill no brainer doesnt understand the fact that if they implemented a global passive theyll powercreep it by more broken global passive while making the enemies more broken too to balance the fcking game
funny how people still dont see mydei reviving infinitely as broken or a problem even tho its totally lore accurate looks like mydei got a pass for some reason lol
if lore mechanic truly implemented on gameplay acheron should have a mechanic that one shot everything regardless whoever it is not just on her technique on mobs
that passive is useless for obtaining a star
i just dont think it matters that much gacha games are preditory at basewhat do you expect from one of the best gachas idk ppl are just so blind just have fun its a game thats what its meant for
ill say it like i always had hsr is just making the kits canon to their loreself
it aint like the game has a pvp system lmao now that i could understand i wouldnt like that at all if it did i dunno why all the tears for ppl just cry over everything
this has a easy fix make it so you get that passive by completing the story even without owning her that way it still lore accurate
im gonna be real if you need a guaranteed revive per battle you might actually need to go back to kindergarten
powercreep in a gacha game why am i not surprised
just wait until theres a character that is almost the same as jade lore wise because the twitter hate her so much for some reason and that character give a permanent crit damage to all characters
they should just put a onoff switch for this
the passive is a problem bcuz it works even when outside of the team the real problem and concerned are how normal will this become all u need to do is make some jackshit lore about authority of death whatsoever and its okay lmao yes my comment related to what drago said about lore type of stuff sure we need to harmonize both lore and skill so that the game is more enjoyable but man we all know its bs
as long as her passive is only active when shes in team im okay with it
so is this information already officially confirmed or is it still based off the leals we got awhile back tho
jokes on you i donnt die i just cannt complete moc under cycles
i think its better if they make it like wild hunt heathclif passive in limbus company where the person gets revived gets damage up but dies after the round
i wish those who dont like it will quit less toxic
this community really are good at doomposting arent they why are you dumbass needlessly worrying about something that isnt happening yet yea global passive that increases damage will be a thing in the future but do you think devs are stupid enough to make them too overpowered that literally just them shooting their self in the legs the passive in the future could be like atk crit dmg divine keys in hi is the same as global passive yet they arent even that helpful you can literally clear all the content without touching the divine keys you guys used fomo as an excuse as if not getting a characters that gives crit dmg to all unit in team is going to make you immediately unable to clear moc
yeah well why doesnt castorice shot ennemies in the overworld or in combat thats canon too so where is it thats because it would ruin the game bad gameplay decisions arent magically good because its lore accurate
same
skill issue just bring some es also pull for sunday
legacymse thats not skill issue that is jade issue
legacymse anyways you dont really need e and s ik youre probably joking but i clear the newest moc easily with only like cycles i know its long im not really good at building characters
my issue is that lore wise shes not supposed to be this powerful shes like above the level of eminators since they are going down this route they should limit it to characters that can back it up with lore and story maybe limit they passive to only be efective when fighting amphoreous enemies
so basically people are upset that a character you are not required to get happens to be good and as a result make the game easier
relax guys even if we are forced at least she has global revive a dragon a scythe shes quantum and one of not gonna be rare in the future remembrance unit
no wonder theres no another seele rerun its lore accurate
hoolay see this as absolute win he can kill us as twice as much
some of yall have way too much free time on your hands to complain about this
bruh those meta slave are really stupid this is only a game just gacha what you want and just ignore the meta what the point if you playing but dont enjoy the character you doesnt need to fully clear all the content in game like example in genshin when neuvilette came out he is so broken but i didnt gacha for him cus i really didnt like male characters even my spiral doest reach but i still enjoying all my character
   
yeah this whole global passive concept is way absurd even in pvp oriented games like epic do not have this kind of thing castorice passive yes its not op however it will be the start of other op passives in the near future because the devs have planned to implement this in future characters in this year about the rewards which many people happy it isnt that good first free pulls same as last year anniversary nothing special second free luocha ruanmei a character who is going to be replaced by that hyacine in and the other one is already on the other side of the hill like seriously the hell devs doing third changes in system we can get seelebladefuxuan now thats a big l whos gonna use them seele can moc with only world class relics and op support so dont use that argument other cases like blade is the same with seele final changes in shop we can get limited characterslightcones a change for whales not to mention the powercreep situation is insane now devs announced they will buff sw kaf jingliu and blade in why so slow by the time the buff arrives i doubt it will solve the problem i can see they are following the hi path now
people really crying over a global passive in a single player game lmao
nobody forces you to pull the character because of the passive if you need a second life to clear endgame content youre just bad at the game most of the people that already clear all end game content dont even need a second life to beat it and no im not referring to whales if you like the character pull for it if you dont like the character or the archetype dont the majority of people complaining are the minorities that go powercreep is bad except when its my favorite character because i know for a fact that if anaxa got this same treatment the anaxa followers hating on cas wouldve been real quiet
people whove been playing for months without any need of a reviver wont give two shits even if this passive exists volcal minorities shouldnt be used as a reliable source of player feedback
people who support this kind of global passive and said no need to pull if you doing just fine then wait till there are global passive in the game and now your fully built team cant beat a bird on the side of the road when doing quest lmao also supported this idea because of lore lmao this is fine because its my waifu yeah until there is a dude with atk global passive then this people will start crying brain dead
if were talking about lore accurate here shes not really immortal isnt she also even if she is the express crew isnt really immortal so that doesnt make any sense pls enlighten me
well that doesnt change the reason for me to pull for cas still going strong with pulling for waifu thats right my acc stinks with waifu
the only way to make global passive a lot of sense is to use account progression the more characters and duplicates eidolons you have the more buffs you have on your account
based on some info from a hoyoverse post we may all get one copy of castorice for free which is genius marketing really her e is nearly mandatory and her lc is straight up mandatory for her so if you give everyone one copy of her they can backtrack the global passive idea making a castorice only thing and make money from people feeling more obligated to make her playable after getting a free copy
now we wait castorice get powercreep patch later
her passive is aight not better than bailu but the problem lies in it being a global passive if the passive required her to be in the party sure but if the community accepts this they will definitely add more broken global passives in the future
while i cant fully get on board with this being the first time in hsr its far from being the last time they pull this lets just hope they can learn from this experiment
i will not give story spoilers but you will enjoy the new quest hopefully and her power scaling
anonymousjygd oh is this content im fairly caught up with the story and i do know shes like the hand maiden of death or something
people are upset bc this practically forces us to get her if we want to do well in hsr and if we dont have her it would make us struggle in some game mods in hsr like moc for example
hotaru_ko not really this passive wont even be seen most of the time assuming you have a sustain in your teams only thing it will change is maybe encourage more people to try going sustainless
the problem isnt that the character is good but that every account that doesnt pull for castorice will be objectively worse their entire account like if players have the exact same the herta team with the exact same relics and traces and everything but one of them pulled for castorice costs around worth of jades btw well their team is better because every one of their character can just not die once then people say oh its just a revive its nothing much but thats the point this time its only a revive but what will it be next maybe itll be a little bit of healing the team then maybe a little bit of a follow up on an ennemy maybe a debuff on all the ennemies then maybe some crit rate increase for the team then maybe its the entire character fighting for you even when its not on the team the skys the limit what we are upset about are these possibilities of account defining characters and if you think its not gonna happend well its hoyo were talking about if they can make more money they will
hotaru_ko youre acting like this will magically make enemies stronger when it wont it will just make people that have the character have an easier time but so what its not a pvp game so you wont be harmed by it
finiraelkhami its not pvp so why do you care that someone has a better character than you if youre actually good at the game then not having castorice shouldnt make you struggle if youre having a hard time with the game its not because you dont have a revive passive its because you need to practice on some easier battles to get better at the game
you are doing classic doomposting right now do you need a reminder that same thing happened with acheron out of combat skill everyone cried its gonna be overpowered and not having acheron will make your acc worse and now shes still the only one who can instakill enemies and in the end nobody really cares for it its simple quality of life feature and so is said revive if you need it its just skill issue if you dont need it and everyone who has any idea how teambuilding works wont ever need it then it might be just another qol feature that will save you one unlucky reset on moc due to enemy targeting
kurumitksaki except in acherons case its just nice to have sure easier exploration but thats its you cant use it for bosses nor end game contents like moc pure fiction whilst castorice is a global effect that activates even when shes not in the team she can stand in bench for all we care and it still activates its not really a problem rn but it may become a problem for future characters because whats next a global heal or a global shield that activates when characters get low hp a global followup attack when an enemy gets low hp a global stat buff speed crit rd yes its not pvp but if just having the character makes end game content easier then its a problem
dlenn my brother you didnt got my point right now as far as im concerned there isnt a single reliable leak about any other global passive and people are outraged about global passives being gamebreaking in the future sure i agree that this might really quickly go downhill but castorice passive isnt anything to be outraged by and i gave acheron as an example of same thing happening in the past just wait and see if next global passive will come out and its gonna be broken then its time to be mad doomposting about assumptions wont change anything
or just maybe we love the game and dont want it to go to shit
well people always will find a way to bitch and cry like a baby
some people think complaining about anything at all means you have way too much free time
yep same here
people can keep crying over this shit and haters always gonna hate but remember folks waifu over meta
kyaa thats right spoken like a real player waifu over meta
jingliunosimp good luck with getting castorice
mohamedsaahil dont worry i unexpectedly got guaranteed when i got therta so if youre pulling for cas take all the luck there is
jingliunosimp oh thank you
kyaa but she is meta are you slow yall seriously acting like criticizing the game for doing something this shitty is hate its always the hoyoverse community istg
spiashh bruh why are u mad i said like what i said and waifu are worth to pull waifu over meta as always btw since when i said criticizing the game is hate im only said haters are always gonna hate no matter what happens lmao
you said hates are always gonna hate implying that people who are against the global passives are hating like holy shit pull whoever you want but you cant call them haters and honestly hating on this game rn is justified
spiashh you talking bout me or someone else if it is about haters then i dont pay attention to them or whatever complain about this global passive unless it is related to the in game storytelling
spiashh chill bruh take a deep breath why are u still mad ive said what i said and i dont need to repeat it times or maybe if you want to hate this game go ahead no one is forcing you to like it and so is quitting but ill stick with my pulls
that literally wasnt even my point aint gonna continue with someone as dumb as you lmfao
kyaa not gonna continue with someone as dumb as you smh
teammate dies castorice revives sike its still hoolays turn
the people not getting on that this is how hyv can get greedier clearly the people happy here either likes casto or hasnt seen the bigger picture lmfao what if in the future they give future chars cr or cd global passive but its on the character you dont wanna pull for suddenly its not fun anymore the premise of them buffing old chars is also an illusion since they slowly wanna add more roster to the standard loss imagine if they just pull a hi divine key on us and release the equivalent of it to force ppl to invest and pull just to make char like blade relevant in the current meta
me enduring years of hell catching up with the high rank players permanent global passives in guardian tales first time
they kept it im so done edit i checked the stream from their channel on bilibili it seems the cn community are defending it
if she is in the team and its not a global buff it would be fine
too many of you ppl live in whataboutisms cheesus crust and is that true one revive per battle someone call the police
lets wait for ten stoneheart ipc which can double stellar jade earnings
im gonna be honest because yall are blowing this out of proportion if they were to give future characters passive like this wheres mydei and his passive wheres anaxa and his passive where is tribbies passive yall gotta think shes an anniversary character meaning shes gonna be a little broken acheron was the first anniversary character and she got a passive to where she can instakill everything but guess what it got nerfed to where it wont work on certain enemies like elite enemies and bosses and trotters if they really wanted to make castorice and the passive a real ongoing thing they wouldve by now with anaxa and the others that were released besides its not even that broken unless you got a shield or healing in that same turn then you wont stay alive shell instantly kill you again slow down and rethink this yea globals seems broken and all the more but you have to realize that this passive will be limited to certain area like open world and possibly not even work in end game content
you need pw player to not make the game dead
bailu revives others too but the fact that she doesnt have to be in the team is broken
id go with both because if i get mydel and if hes not in vendetta state then it will revive mydel just for a backup revival so i can use gallagher and get his vendetta state back into action right now i lost to baliu so i might get mydel as a guarantee pity
what do you think bro the fandom just needs to chill the heck out like bro dude calm your st man pls scuse my language im just upset with how like of the fandom and how they react to crap like this
remember castorice is slower which a dps should not never have think of this as an replacement
idk why people gone crazy for this passive if you have strong sustain your character would never die to activate her passive make a account have her and not have her basically the same i think those who complain about that just a dumb ass with massive skills issue
thats a fucking hp what are you gonna do with it
i mean if she revives our character in the middle of a boss turn then it wouldnt do much if castorices the only one who has a global passive and doesnt spread to newer characters then i guess it wouldnt really be a problem but if they decide to add more though then that would not be good for the game
personally in my mind the devs had two options they couldve introduced global passives as a separate announcement and give existing characters especially the free units passives already however theres the second option that they took and outright gave it to the new limited character i peacefully left on my own behalf from hsr since but idk if i could even tolerate with whats happening to the game recently
its totally bullshet if u ask me its agreeable coz castorice lore bla if there is st case there will be ndrdth and goes on just coz fvcking lore thing this same like played a game only to be lead around by developers team not pulling prepared for future hardship pulling prepared to skip banner u originally plan to pull coz u either fp or small spender lets be real here gacha doesnt guaranteed u got it on st shot if u not losing banner st imagine u lose st to otheryeahand on hard pity too u goes another hard pity for guaranteed now u had sj nor pass for lc or u goes hardway again same like before to get the sig lc just coz some character labeled as must have character or meta me not happy at all im planning to pull anaxa after allim already unhappy with my offbanner guaranteed pull win of chance
they should have done team passives before global passives like hook and clara together lets hook followup whenever clara counters or kalfa and traveler lets the traveler do a random dot to enemies jumping to global passives is throwing everyones wallets into the deep end
i think its good bcz hsr depends on power creep the enemies are getting strong so the characters should also have to be broken like who would like to use seele in today meta the more stronger the enemy the more broken the characters should be and this is gacha game u can get a lot of pulls easily in hsr so u can definitely take castoris we are getting almo pulls in next update how much fp do u need bruh
yeah not as op as they think only team with healers will benefit this more
randomviewer i think the main concern isnt that the passive itself is op but it opens up the possibilities of actual good global passives that are powercreep incarnnate
joaquinxqwo so all these dramas are about whatifs
bunnyx yep
bunnyx whatifs about situations that already happened before ie silver wolf being able to addnegate elemental weaknesses and now like what or characters can do the same thing she does like have you seen anaxa
bassicly noth what ifs global passives are a thing now and there will be more
randomviewerup until theres a character with a global passive that gives crit rate to every character in your account it sets a bad precedent and the fact that people are defending it its just killing the game yall are literally turning into the genshin fandom
athai_ stop exaggerating the only characters that can implant their own weakness are breakfocused characters because theres simply no place for sw in those teams and they would be useless without breaking obviously the first character that directly powercreeps sw is anaxa and anaxa only after two years
bunnyx yup basically just what ifs and projecting their bad thoughts lmao their basis is that if castorice sells so well they just gonna bring forth future charas with global passives too keep in mind last year we got acheronan anniversary character too btw who still to this day the only one that has instakill technique if acheron sells so well why didnt they introduce a new character that basically can just instakill an eliteboss enemy people quite literally bitch about this for the sake of bitching about hoyoverse game smh
joaquinxqwo yeah no itll be a serious while before we see a global passive like this remember when aventurine broke the game with his op shields and it sparked a dilemma of how broken future preservation characters will beguess what no preservation character is released since then
and your mindset is going to fucking kill the game acherons technique helps with overworld exploration by basically removing enemies her technique doesnt instakill a boss in moc its far from the same thing as castorices global passive which helps you out in endgame modes besides we did get other characters who also help out in the overwordl massively like the herta locating treasure chests or feixiao with the speed boost and who also makes you able to just ignord enemies in the overworld rappa with the speed boost as well or even robin there are more its really sad to see that people like you are actively defending this shitty and scummy behavior but i guess if you want star rail to die then suit yourself literally turning into the genshin fandom and castorice is going to sell well
itsbiox and yet youre completely wrong because leaks confirm future characters talking like patches ahead will also have these passives acherons feature is a technique while this is something castorice doesnt even need to be on the team to provide so theyre very much different
havidikevidi so basicly youre saying that in two year we will have the castorice powercreep with an even stronger global passive and the game has no good futur perspective nice
people who over think her global passive cleary shows that hoyo games are their first gacha games
joaquinxqwo and then what it doesnt matter if it becomes a thing dont pull for the character if you dont like them its that easy if this happened to a character you liked your reaction would be a lot more different
im_motivatedayato quite the opposite actually the people overthinking this are gacha veterans whove experienced this same thing happen to other games and are trying to warn players majority of hoyo fans first gacha was genshin impact and since that game barey has powercreep they think everything is peaches and cream
wage no its not gonna kill the game cuz the game is a story based game there are no leader board its all for end game content which a lot of people dont care much getting cycle or whatever and lastly even if its an example a crit rate is no where near as ok as all your characters survive at one hp and you also need to heal them up or else they are still dead
ronreed genshin has barely any powercreep think again and these so veterans probably has experienced these things on a gacha game with leaderboards
your mindset is the reason this game is dying youre no different from a genshin players and im not saying her global passive is omg insane you have to get it it gives you trillion buffs and it baffles me that you dont get it because its not that hard tk understand they are adding this which is negative to the game theyre going to balance endgame modes around these global passived and are basically giving players the middle finger if you didnt get the character eith the global passive the new boss is a prime example not going into details cause its leaks the powercreep is bad enough as it is and this just adds another layer to it the game isnt a story game its a gacha game a game where you pull for characters and use those chaarcters in endgame modes this global passive is extremely bad predatory and scummy if you dont get that then dont even talk please
im_motivatedayato am i wrong unlike star rail units are still capable of clearing spiral abyss even after years star rail is now reaching its nd year and powercreep is already x that of genshins enemies have million hp and deal enough damage to one shot without aventurine they literally had to make a casual mode because story bosses got too hard to beat yes newer genshin characters are stronger than old ones but that balances out because the enemies are easy to beat even with old characters
ronreed lay out the links and sources for this confirmed global passives the characters gonna have that you got all the bread crumbs and leaks literally has not mentioned any of it whatsoever unless you got yourself a fake leak that is lmao if you want to confirm the leaks theres literally a reddit thread specifically for it
ronreed i have not seen a lot of ventis nor klees clearing spiral abyss not even the first characters genshin gave us for free cuz ur only talking about the supports apart from those any other and even genshin has reached hp inflations above mil so again you are mistaken if you think genshin has no power creep cuz characters mavuika citlali
wage the game has a story and you can use gacha to get characters even you a illiterate person would know that this game has a story and not just end game content and no one has a gun pointed at your head to tell you finish moc
ronreed it was rumors not leaks same leaks that told us seele and standard characters are getting a buff and look at whose getting one now every new character since x is insane op must pull yada yada and people will still skip and not pull
so now were moving to insulting each other then this is a game not a visual novel its a turn based rpg game why do oyu think they release characters every patch why do you think they release new endgame modes new expansions because this is a game you get the characters to clear endgame content because its the main thing that attracts people to play this game and if youre just going to ignore everything i said respectfully shut up and dont talk
good comment made me laugh yes i hate hoolay because bro keeps hogging turns
joaquinxqwo just make every character have unique global passive issue fixed
itsbiox acheron ignores weaknesses and most of the characters after her release ignores weaknesses such as rappa boothill fugue etc plus acherons technique is only available in the overworld and some parts of su and does not affect endgame the same way as castorice does
fr
but still its like bailus revive
shadow bailu revives once and she needs to be on the team
joaquinxqwo are we just gonna ignore the fact they had god keys in hi and those are not some super significant global buffs but just something thats nice to have if you have it but not needed unless youre competing with players on the leaderboard hoyo has done this before and probably knows the right formula for it since they have been doing this for agesgks were around for a long time
on the bright side bailu is no longer the only character with a revive mechanic
bunnyx another big what if is people think alot of characters are going to get one in the future but so far up till doesnt seem like any kits would have one confirmed upto wont have any
i believe if you revive with the passive it mantains th chr at hp until they take a turn
joaquinxqwo hoyo can do that whenever they want their main audience is asia and asia loves this
athai_ sw is still the only character that can effectively engate weakness as she is the only inplanter with res shred not saying shes good tho but shes still the only unit with a meaningfull implant
athai_ the problem is is silver wold exist in early and shes a debuffer so theres not too much of a power creeping and shes perfectly effective in mono quantum but being in multiple element team even with just quantum any element in team her elemental change gets ruin or if youre fighting multiple enemies who isnt a quantum weakness removes her op side yes you can apply weakness but the thing is the more elements you have in team the more harder it is to get what you need me as a silver wolf user since her first banner release already seen this flaw thats why i only use her in mono quantum because you only have ro worry about chance of not applying debuffs to enemies and will always focus on planting quantum element trust me its more fun using silver wolf in mono quantum than in any set up in fact that the only way you can say shes op is she is the main carry of mono quantum because she dont have to plant another element weakness and will always land as quantum she isnt op or powercreeping anyone because her skill and ulti only land in enemy at a time welt seele is strong even after silver wolf just released castorice on the other hand shows a big powercreep jump and give an idea for even bigger powercreep jump in future because of global buff this thing is new and ut is kinda broken but it open up more potential of op shes a remembrance the fact she already have a global buff and then if you use her as active you get another bastard on the side and the fact her eidolon even got buffed after the community complain which is funny but anyways im pulling for her not because of powercreeping w
joaquinxqwo as i stated in another post people are giving hoyo way too much credit on global passives none will ever be game breaking because it is not hoyos way of making the game easier that way their version of powercreep will always be charactersgear first with global passives being way down the line of what is needed look at hi divine keys exist are global passives but arent mandatory unless you are in desperate need for xtals a week
bunnyx well yeah obviously because those whatifs have already been shown in the power creep already present in the game right now as much as i love hsr this is taking it too far with a global passive such as this look at all the older characters theyre practically useless in the current endgame modes and even the bosses in the story are too hard to fight even with a good build of said characters and i do love castorice dont get me wrong a lot of the meta characters are my favorites but even so i cant pull for each one so yk its kinda unfair for them to make characters with such op buffs
yh ngl most times this revive wont do shit unless you lucky enough and pop heals right after
itsbiox i would like to be as brainless as some of youshame that different global passives have already been datamined sike
darknessincinc provide the source then links whatever ive seen people saying this same thing and never ever given a source and basically just saying trust me bro lmao not a single credible laker has given any info nor crumbs about said global passives that you talked about my guy
darknessincinc provide the source then ill wait ive seen way too many people spreading this fake info everywhere lmao not a single credible dreamer has provided an info nor crumbs about said global passives that you just talked about my guy
darknessincinc provide proof or evidence of said info then ive seen too many people spreading this fake datamine info and not a single credible dreamer has given information about said global passives that you just talked about my guy
darknessincinc provide source or evidence of your datamined info then ill wait lmao people are spreading this fake info like wildfire not single credible source has talked about the global passives that you just said bro
darknessincinc give source of what you just said then ill wait ive seen too many people spreading this fake infos like wildfire lmao not a single credible laker has given any info of said global passives that you just said my guy
darknessincinc give the source of your datamined info then ill wait ive seen too many people say this and not once i see a source by someone credible everyone that said this just basically saying trust me bro lmao
bunnyx if you think them adding more global passiveswhich they already have a name for btw its not like they said its castorices specialsignature abilitypassive is an if and not a when well i dont like insulting people so im just gonna say youre silly
joaquinxqwo it is a whatif the future will even be that op to start the drama
kimaki thats also a what if why everybody think hoyo would ruin one of their main income theyre a multi million company they know wat theyre doing
wage think about it through there is no concrete proofs about the up coming global passives will be over powered and must have hoyo aint doin dumb moves to just dunk their own income
hydranic they know soo much what theyre doing that for each of their game they have bad reputation increasing and got some boycott and review bombing so yeah sure they know
wage tbf the main thing that attract people was the characters and gachas not the endgame contents
randomviewer not th shield also count but is not op i think
hydranic ive seen so many people spread this false info around so much sad that most casual and oblivious people that didnt know how to check if the info is credible or not one quick google search you got the reddit thread that specifically talks about said leaks falls for it everyone that ive ask about this global passive info has not given any credible or source at all smh
kimaki tell me u judge a book without reading by not telling
bunnyx these what ifs are very likely to happen seeing the state if the game right now its pretty much going to happen global buffs power creep
thatguywithnolife what ifs will always be what ifs sure more global passives will get added but none gonna make the game unplayable without
joaquinxqwo probably not due to the backlash on top of the fact that she probably has a global passive because she is the birthday character of hsr
bunnyxall these dramas are about potential for moneydraining
itsbiox technique it is only useful in su or overworld if you dont oneshot basic enemies already and its not even that useful you can snowball through the first wave fast but then it becomes useless we can say that therta powercrept acheron in that field cause she deals hp damage to normal enemies but also deals hp damage to elites and bosses
itsbiox as a wise fictional villain once said your reasoning is highly illogical
maingrader i mean dpses sell better if the stats from revenues are reliable also we are getting next preservation in later x dan heng is going to be next preservation unit if nothing will change
im_motivatedayato i dont remember any global passives in my fgo journey or even in idle heroes
dorinhere i point out acheron and her technique specifically as a basis for comparison since both her and castorice are technically categorized as special anniversary characters and both has something special on their kit that no one else has for acheron her one shot technique still to this day no other character has that instakill tech that you can use even without entering combat and castorices global passive the argument here are people basically going on a pointless outrage because of this since theyre basically accusing hoyo will definitely add more they dont have any solid evidence for that btw if castorice sells well while people forget how crazy are the sales for acheron too if acheron sells so well why they dont double down on it and make a new character that can one shot elite enemies too and not just basic mobs most people that freak out over this is just freaking out for the sake of freaking out lmao i also have seen people spreading rumors regarding future global passive but till to this day not single one of them that i ask has provided solid evidence nor a credible and reliable source for it and are just saying it on the basis of trust me bro
im_motivatedayato thats not how it works i am myself pulling for rice but the global passive thing will force players to pull for broken passives on characters they dont like you will be pulling for features not the characters at this point and if you will struggle in any gamemode people will start calling you stupid cause you didnt pull essential global passive when for example phainon would give you the option to equip lcs which would boost your stats by literally double while also getting effects from the nd lc being fp will become unrelatable for whole community or imagine if all future characters would give you some sort of global passive and for example the character you like will get the garbage one compared to his competition like attack boost vs def shredres penspeed
im_motivatedayato but in genshin you have a hyperbloom or what was that called a reaction that makes any character from dendroelectrohydro element able to full clear the endgame content
im_motivatedayato genshin is also a story game zz is also a story game but the main way of getting the resources for the character you want is from endgame modes we got to the point where a lot of players are struggling to clear moc and while in other games you have mechanics that help like being able to dodge or having really strong mechanics like elemental reactions hsr has only break which isnt really reliable in the most of times
me if i got castorice if you revive youre not gonna get healed or shielded youre destined to die so go back to the dead bish or ill just use their basic attack or restart since i do restart whenever someone dies
bunnyxthey literally did the same thing with acheron theyre obviously gonna do the same thing with castorice lmao jesus christ this is hoyoverse were talking about stop acting like they wouldnt do something like that arent they the same company that remade acherons ability to ignore weakness but much better arent they the same people that paygated exploration in genshin impact even behind constellation just to powercreep them stop sucking the dick of hoyoverse they dont gaf about you and you might ask how am i sucking the dick of hoyo its because youre trying too fucking hard to give them the benefit of the doubt and act like its a what if situation as if they havent pulled stuff like this before on multiple occasions and considering that my friend was shown leaks of fate collab characters having global passives i think theres a little chance that they might be better than castorices if you cant tell
havidikevidialr so why are acheron feixiao firefly rappa fugue and boothill it doesnt matter if theyve break focused smh they shouldnt be able to implant weaknesses or just straight up ignore them maybe the game would actually be a bit more balanced if they thought about shit like that lmao along with people in the community like you
not enough proof to cry about it now then joaquinxqwo
why people cant get around the fact that some people play it just to enjoy the story why do they think its always about clearing end game content this and that i dont even care if i cant clear all of moc or spiral abyss i will only lose some extra jades im fp play genshin from day and never clear all spiral abyss chill and just pull your fav character build it properly and it can still clear most content just enjoy the game and if the game goes pw so bad you cant win without pulling some character just leave it and move on
randomviewerif you heal or theyre shielded before the teammates next turn they regain like most of their health its not a revive if they get hit they wont take any dmg if they dont get healed or arent shielded before their turn they die for real
and her come hoolay with the iron chair
ronreed i remember when jiaoqiu got leaked then people started complaining that he wasnt as strong as the testleak
even e fu xuan can tank hoolay after multiple moon rages
hadeshi so like as long as you have castorice and put four different characters on a team setup any of our character die will then get revive infinitely thats a good thing how is it gonna disrupt the games balance
shadow it only gonna get triggered time per battle no more than that
bunnyx these what ifs are coming true according to leaks theres already characters who has global passives
unibocchi provide the source all the credible leakers has not confirm nor has talked about more global passive than castorices lmao i seen couple people said this but not even once i received the sources of it
unibocchi provide the source ive seen couple people keep on saying this but not once they provide the source
hydranic dude the fact that the first global passive is a totem of undying id doubt theyll be any less broken from now on assuming that they wont add more musthave characters with insane global passives is putting more trust in hoyo than they deserve rn
thatguywithnolife i hope for the bright side why would i put hope in them to add must have characters the totem of dying aint even that good since it revives at hp and in contrast expecting to add over powered global passives just gonna feed the drama up
hydranic the devs already dooming the game should you be the optimist or the realist is the real question here
hydranic on the side note the totem of undying is very good it keeps you alive when you really need it like if youre traveling deep into the nether or end without cheats enabled also it gives you regeneration fire resistance and absorption not to mention is removes all negative effects from you
its fine literally of community pulled for shielding monster
itsbiox one time per battle so its like bailus case how is it gonna disrupt game balance
thatguywithnolife better those who straight up insults the game and dig up past drama which are dumb instead of givin proper thought for the game and no saying how trash the game is for something it have is not how u want better for the game that is my main problem with this drama
malevolentcherry yes we ignore hi i mean where is that game now it s gone from orbit aside from its own fanbase and people who played the game now only wanted to know the story of either welt himeko and otto and note that this riot wasnt even just because gp only storytelling that goes down in quality every new patch released kit locked behind eidolon and lc hp inflation powercreep imbalance meta lack of good events lately fomo banner placement and rerun star star ratio unclear remembrance role pw annive event expensive team cost for everytime new character got released old unit huff being further delayed to as well as the disappointment from previous patch like sunday not being able to pair up with casto aglaea that need expensive team and bananacademys patch gp was really just final push of this riot especially on how hoyo put this kit on an already overloaded unit like casto who have all heal dmg sustain and debuff already
hydranic so are we supposed to praise the devs for their predatory practices
thatguywithnolife bro u know how to read the entire sentence
thatguywithnolife there is a reason professional criticizers exist among criticizers
hydranic show me your clear of current endgame with full year team then talk
isomeria i need to clear the end game to say that most of the community is stupid and dont know how to act i dont think so and the fact they decided to attack vas because of castorice now pretty much make it a community issue
the koolaid man strikes again
noo the ptsd
bunnyx no theres already leaks about a other characters with global passives including phainon account wide spd crit and dmg bonus buffs are already leaked
i always hate those drama makers from twitterx and other social so much making dramatic protest before experiencing the release version
kenwilliamang then theyre bitching abt a good thing too op who tf uses bailu anymore yet she works the same you dont gotta get anyone you dont wanna get if you wanna skip then skip you dont need anyone in the game except when the game forces new mechanics on you but you can still beat those tv monkeys without rappa so
bunnyx yes it is the reason why people thinking that way because of the content creators for me i dont care with the global passive because this is a pve centric game not for pvp people taking this game seriously its like they cant love without this game just appreciate what devs is offering its already been years they need to release true anniversary unit
and the char will still die after
joaquinxqwo yes it just a small life insurance
joaquinxqwo ah yes lets wait for their ass to add phainon emanator of destruction has the authority of crit dmg crit rate atk cuz destruction kinda sounds offensive
not necessarily if you have a healers ult ready
and the team need to have healer or shielder too if they get revived and not recieving shield or heal then they fall again
randomviewer its hp its not your turn and if you dont receive heal until a specific time count she still kills you again its not that broken
she will sell as she is a new mechanic character and is the best dps by now and still her banner is the first of the new type banners and even so shes pretty asf how it is not going to sell having a half ass revive passive that even bailu has its not her selling point itsbiox
im_motivatedayato i havent even touched moc and doesnt feel bad at all its just a hard battle for like wishes why would you break up for that they literally give you wishes every patch
wage even seele the first character released can destroy endgame you dont need castorice or the crit mf you need to get good and build your characters correctly
yeah i need to get crit rate crit dmg substats on her and a perfect run to be able to clear with her its just cope at this moment i have seele and no matter what i try be it e tribbie or s sunday she just doesnt manage
sukaikitsune like timing right when it happens with an ult and the huohuos lightcone
userfxczdht right bcs everybody has huohuos lightcone and i doubt you can time when you die
userfxczdht never have i ever said she will not sell my guy all the drama and bs that happen rn regarding hsr is basically people doomposting about how future characters will for sure have global passives like her has not ever been confirmed btw and people out here got tricked into believing fake leaks saying phainon and other characters will have global passive lmao
havidikevidi u forgot firefly bro
im_motivatedayato how is that gonna happen i hope it does happen to the character i like but thats literally impossible seeing they just bluffing abt buffing old characters
im_motivatedayato dont be mistaken i like cas but if i pull for her then what next she gets powercreep and just like that my money wasted
itsbiox i can smell the future global passive believe me its money bro dont u get it
bunnyx yeah old characters are getting powercreep even my blade gets powercreep i really hope those characters buff rumours were true
kingsley if they make that even the old characters than i had nothing to complain lol
bababoey ive done that for like over characters across all the gacha ive played i just shrug it off cuz there are things in life that are out of my control and again its your choice and i should respect it
im_motivatedayato yeah i know most of gacha games are like this well i just do what i could do so that this game would stay goated if the devs are ignorant then thats thatbut i really hope that hsr would think of different ways to make money rather than this sly way of tricking players to pull for characters thatll soon be useless
userfxczdht seele destroy endgame link
im_motivatedayato i dont care at first but when i think back and all of them gets powercreep bro seriously hoyo done you bad bro im not promoting here but u should try wuwa their characters are not getting powercreepat least for now maybe that game will soothe your pain
wage can i defend this if i want honkai star rail to fail
im_motivatedayato venti is still incredibly broken in mob floors klee yeah shes been doomed to fail since she is just comparable to diluc since release speaking of diluc bro is actually good now an og character you say powercreep in mavuika but i have used my tao to full clear ever since point is even if mavuika isnpowercreep as long as older characters like tao and arlecchino are strong pyro dps its all good in hsr though can we say the same about blade jingliu imbibitor ill ignore seele since if you have no life and grind relics you clear with her but you still need meta support heck even non jiaoqiu es acheron is having issues if not having enough dps lately in gi you get away with the ogs bennett xq or kazuha
havidikevidi stop defending bad designs and overloaded abilities just for the act of greed meanwhile arknights has all characters even low star rating still playable and able to clear content and honkai in just two years already going in powercreep spree in order to inventive the need of the new character at all cost
mfs take personal i also felt this a lot of time
wrong i had an argenti wipe out my whole team but they got revived then my castorice went and then my lingsha healed the whole team and we ended up winning the fight
i swear these people are the reason we dont have english vas for some characters
castorices global passive aint that op when it comes to enemies that has multiple turns such as hoolay but still its pretty useful for some end games
bababoey not rumors the devs mentioned it and its coming true
bunnyx dont get me wrongi really love to have jingliu buffed but i dont have high hopes for this one
they are hoyobots of course they are not going to notice hyv greediness
reallifeskeleton you know she was a special case right
tyutyururu shes for sure not gonna be a special case anymore after they release new characters with the same global buffs as her
tyutyururu not needing energy to ult was a special case for acheron now we have feixiao that obliterates bosses not even needing to get a single turn forcing elemental weakness was exclusive to silver wolf firefly summons was a thing of jim yuang we got a whole new type for only summons no she aint a special case nor will be the only one to have it
what if i just dont care are you going to deter me from playing
iliveforchips they cant since they made her powers connected to lore i dont think theres any other characters that are blessed with the powers of death
asraelredfire ill break this down into multiple parts for you
asraelredfire about the summons the general isnt of remembrance its not a memosprite its an emanator that was given to him
asraelredfire also feixiao also has one of those summons
asraelredfire about the elemental weakness youre saying that as if that is the same as a global passive which its not
asraelredfire i dont really know what to say for the first thing since i dont have either of those characters
asraelredfire hoyo made a special character do a special thing because of her lore so why would someone else get that power
xenoemblem nobody is stopping you ok most ppl that criticise still play bcs its a game they love
the global buff doesnt have to be related to death or lore they can make it about atk aspd def hp ill say it she wont be anything special after one or two patches
tyutyururu idk much about hsr lore now but is she in the lore can revive people without being there
reallifeskeleton no since she kills anything she touches did you want her to kills everything with a touch they cant genuinely add that since that would make every dps useless so they went for the alternative she doesnt even res them either she just puts their death on a longer time so if you dont heal theyre going to die
tyutyururu guess she is not lore accurate then
well idgaf because i dont decide my pulls based on that global passive i decided which char that will benefit the most in my team comp if they had a gp then its a bonus anw my teams are almost complete so yeah if i dont have that global passive then thats not gonna be the end of the world
yeah its not the first game to have something like this so the this might spread to other games worry is too late as hsr itself isnt patient
no it works in end game content
x thing have spark controversy ah of course just an average day in a hoyoverse community of any game honestly i never like endgame stuff i just want to enjoy and chill look at arknight for example game is so hard that i have to use guide everytime a new boss arrived its ridiculous tbh
global passives are might be new mechanic for all of new characters and castorice is test for this mechanics but people refuse to have something new and thats awkward
imagine years later with no other character having global thing and ppl still complain about castorice its just a guess
not a problem as i already decided to pull before the livesteam
yall have to stop complaining about characters having this characters being that enemies whatever and instead wonder if this game is even fun to begin with
barbara in genshin impact has the same ability just that she has to be in the team to for the revive ability to work
bro shes not a must have character like they are pretty good units if u have the following firefly feixiao acheron rappa boothill aglea the herta jing yuan who is still pretty good seele im joking silver wolf shes getting buffed and thats it and if u dont like have these characters then build them and u can still clear all content with good teams of course
im skipping her though
just because castorice has global passive doesnt mean shes a must pull i really hate this narrative of people just because this character has a broken ability means u have to get her this global passive appeared and then suddenly people cares about the meta of hsr like bro what like heck im skipping castorice for my boy phainon because i like his character and also people calling paywin its dumb u playing gacha game of course there will be paywin aspect i swear people are just dumb
these are gotcha games they only care about making money people will boycott by going to another gotcha game to feed their lust filled gambling addiction
youre not really forced to get her its a great help sure but if you youre forced to get her youre absolutely wrong since weve been years without this mechanic in the game and everyone can beat endgame modes just by investing in your dps and supports just do the same if you dont want to wish for casteroise
cough bailu cough and who tf gives a crap about it still working without her in the party just be happy that a free life is available it sounds like a super premium feature so let the super premium feature be a feature you work hard to get grinding for jades or buy it outright its such a sad thing to be complaining about power creeps are real they exist they arent gonna stop its stupid to make every character responsibly similarly powerful no one would pay for new characters less income to hoyoverse worseslower updates god damn it the games are free you a do not have to complete everything b you do not have to pay for everything c it is a free to play game with purchasable items for people who worked for the money to pay for it we fp players work in game to afford our characters others work in real life to afford their characters its simple people just quit bitching and be grateful that you have a new character releasing that does something new would you be excited about a new character if they did nothing newno boosts no youd only pull for designlore wise and from how many times ive seen players admit to skipping important dialogue gives me the impression not many people care about the lore or personality of characters so like no who cares its a game you dont need to spend money on it if youre that upset about castorice then just save for her and get her no need to build apparently considering the entire roster boost buff she gives
one way to make this better is to remove it from her kit and add global passives in the game via the story or special challenges that you can do to unlock themimo
the passive is literally revive for turn if get healed youre good if not the characters go back to dying
you really dont need her to be honest
so of hoyo ever adds a character that canonically can steal money from peoples bank account does that mean theyll be able to tske money from your actual bsnk account wouldnt that be s thing huh
the passive works even if shes not on the team what does that even mean if i pull her and leave her in my inventory id still get her buffs
working outside of combat seems scummy but at the same time who cares the game doesnt balance around new characters so its the same endgame wether you have her or not also lore accuracy is alot more valuable because it promotes suspension of disbelief which is the most important thing hoyo games should all have
im guaranteesoyeah
next comes the authority of dmgbonus who gives bonus dmg even when not in the battle next up are authority of respen boost and defignore boost dont worry tho they are just lore accurate still means you have to get them
maybe you should read the boss mechanics then which is part and parcel of a strategyfocused tower defense game arknights is not difficult the overall floor of difficulity of the game hasnt changed much since day of release its just a puzzle you need to solve and unlike hsr doesnt shill their new characters with the new bossesevents ak veterans actually blindly brute force most content in the game except their roguelike mode the only reason they use guides is to play the stage the lazyafk way not because they cannot clear the stage itself
plus cast might eventually be added to the new shop in or as an option in the limited loss pool
shes not a must pull but her global passive kind of makes her a must pull if you want to do decently in moc or apoc shadow which is why many people are annoyes
im sorry but this is probably the most ignorant and arrogant take i have seen in a long time you make out people only care about the meta now like are you blind people have been complaining about the meta since jingliu came out cause of the gross power creep and then since post sparkle everyone has been complaining about how powercreep was getting out of hand and then when firefly came out and break became the dominant meta by design people were not happy and you i like how you picked and chose what people have said to fit your own narrative about the global passives cause here is the thing yes it is a broken ability and unfair to just have an auto revive just for existing and not being in the team as it should have been cause like people have said if this is the future its only gonna get worse since all these abilities will stack and how long till we get atk crit sod auto healing boosts and on top of that with how power creep is in this game im sure shes now a top meta unit so now its just a gross win win situation and sets a bad slate for the future and your last point is probably one of the worst overused poorly thought out excuses there is cause there are a lot of gacha games which arent pw the problem and yes there are always aspects in games the problem here is its being pushed in your face and the implementation so really you call people dumb but in actuality you are probably the dumb one here cause of how pig headed you are and if you want an easy example lets look at hoyos other releases genshin and zz notice how very few people complain about the power scaling but in this game its prominently talked about so really i think its best you do some basic research and have an actual idea of what you are talking about before you look like a fool and if you are just gonna come back with i think this and i have no problem with this there for i am right just dont even reply
hotaru_ko no you do not need every busted characters to decently clear the end game you just need a not too old team and give your characters a good relics leveling cas will be a top meta char not because the global passive but the damage she can do
its still a global passive and a single revive can do a lot not to mention hoyo will balance future content around this passive hurting players who didnt get her even more
noobthenewt but even so they already stated theyll buff old units so it wont be much of a problem if they keep buffing old units which are old but still useable if built right and with the right team plus their is no garantuee that all future content around this passive so its still not much of a big deal
willy_ okay you are really missing the point of why people are not happy cause think of it like this people have been complaining a lot recently about how powercreep happening every other week is getting out of hand the hp inflation in end game modes are getting way too bloated by adding these global passives that means difficulty will only get worse and we know they are gonna add new passives and old units getting buffs is just no its not gonna fix anything like congratulations you went from a to a and you say right builds and teams thats easier said then done cause of people do not get relics the hand of god has and no guarantee havent you been focusing on the meta when they decided lets make break units the big thing everything was centered around break the hp inflation is cause of the new units so it is guaranteed they will make content around this and its a grim outlook for the future
if shes a must have character then get her save who youre saving for for later if shes must have then the answer is obvious its easy to get her shit im about to pull a guaranteed mydei and hoping his light cone too and will likely be able to castorice before her banner ends and im fp spent money twice last year to get day passes didnt even collect most of them since late i have made around wishes will edit with an exact number once i check but damn are yall sure amphoreus isnt based on america cuz the fans of amphorius basics are so much better than the rest of the like simple chain of demand
sike its still hoolays turn
anoshthatplayminecraft and they call that op not even the fact that she can summon a dragon who looks like it can shred any boss yeh they have more than one screw loose
im_motivatedayato youre not seeing the bigger picture that literally everyone else is talking about lol how
kotoriminalinsky erm so thats a what if what are they gonna make a character with a passuve that reduces all enemies hp that enter by or a global passive that makes all your characters first turn gurantee a crit on all their hits
kotoriminalinsky is the bigger picture that you are talking about are the what ifs cuz its being narrow minded and paranoid
notme isnt that just some curios in the sim uni the parchment that always eat
xeenoo its not narrowminded or paranoid if its the natural progression of things lol its like the characters themselves they get better and more broken over time do you really believe that hoyoverse is gonna stop the global passives on castorice because thats actually pretty dumb the global passives will only get better and more broken over time
notme the best part is that we dont know but just like we get incredibly broken characters we can only assume that the same thing will happen crit rate crit damage exta hp etc but not only is that the point but eventually people are going to be pulling for the global passives idk if i have to point it out but thats bad for the players good for the billionaire company its not uncommon for companies to test the boundaries of their consumers to see how much they can get away with it happens all the time
kotoriminalinsky we already have buffs for that_
kotoriminalinsky explain why bonus stats are bad for players
xeenoo i can see why you think its good but its making the game even more pay to win we already have hp inflation happening in the future when youre pulling for characters just for their global passives thats not good youre just falling for their sleazy money grabbing tactics people like you are the perfect targets for greedy companies
kotoriminalinsky im fp so i dont know what predatory thing are they doing global passives do not make me spend money on them whether it was a bonuse crit rate or crit damage it doesnt make me spend my money on them so i dont really get when people say that theyre getting more predatory and greedy
kotoriminalinsky yeah since they add a global passive its possible they will add more so what is so bad about that you will feel obligated to pull for character since they give you extra crit because you will miss out if you didnt pull for them do you pull for every character they release
xeenoo i understand what you mean im also fp i got back into the game recently but their tactics definitely work considering that theyre consistently at the top of gacha games when it comes to making money the purpose of gacha games is to get players to spend money ie limited banners just because you and i dont spend on the game doesnt mean that others also dont im just saying that because people continuously put up with their bad behavior or be passive about it it just makes the game worse side note but relevant its why we dont get good qol updates because people arent very vocal about it and continue giving their money to this game lol
kotoriminalinsky yeah majority of the players makes the game worse also is tp a bad qol are treasure gadgets bad its only you loud minority thinking that if we dont have this something that other games had bad qol
xeenoo man theres no point in talking with you if this is genuinely how you think i will give you credit where its due though hsr qol isnt as bad as genshins
xeenoo just stop talking to this paranoid person im fp too and i cant bother givin a crap about the passive its literally have a big unique on its stat screen that makes me question at what point do things stop being unique to a character
xeenoo because it is locked behind a literal paywall tf you mean each update only gives you enough pulls for a near chance to get a star via soft pity and then you need to contend with the this passive and future ones is not garunteed and you know it isnt it is bad for the consumer you nimwit the billion dollar company with a gambling mechanic just roped you in again with another incentive to keep pulling and inticing you to cave in to spend money if this passive was a only active when castorice is on the team or b applied to the main character or a standard banner unit this would be fine it is not about the revive being op and unfair this is a game where you spam your buttons and defeat the moc enemy without breaking a sweat dying has never been an issue in this game and its not about that lets put this into irl terms for you because let me remind you a gacha game is factually gambling if you go play at the casino and go their brand new slot machine that lets you get an additional bonus for pulling a certain limited time value that gives you better chances at winning what do you think is happening here the answer is obvious the house is enticing you to keep pulling the slots until you get that value because otherwise you lose out its limited time after all and it benefits you forever anyone with a brain will say thats predatory it is not good for the consumer it gives the illusion that it is good for you but all it does at the end of the day is line more of your money into the houses pockets but no add a anime waifu and some mind numbing gameplay with sick animations and suddenly its no longer predatory right even though both the limited time character passive because the character is limited time and limited time special value mechanically serve the same purpose every gacha is inheriently predatory whether you like or not and if you are free to play it doesnt fucking matter a casino that lets you play for free limited time is still a fucking casino i like playing gacha games just like how i like playing normal games at no point should any player start defending the developers from trying to squeeze more money from their community look at any gacha cc look at how everyone hates lootboxes a western gacha mechanic look at any offical opinion look at any law document chinese american or otherwise the consensus is clear to see gacha is gambling and gambling is inherinently predatory even the time you spend is a currency thats why you are able to play for free you are paying with your time
yes
uh no the game does balance itself around the new characters for both story and endgame this is beyond the scope of global passives btw which is why powercreep discussionscontroversy is such a serious issue in hsr it makes powercreep discussions in other games like arknights look like a joke in comparison i can guarantee if hsr stops excessive shilling of new characters and funnels all the hp inflation to a new moc or apocpf that doesnt provide any jadesjust miscel rewards of powercreep complaints will dissolve immediately
dchy beyond the scope meaning global passive isnt included in any case if this is a similar case to genshin where the abyss syzygyimaginarium theatre buff works in parallel with the current banners it doesnt mean the abysstheatre is impossible to complete without it it looks like the ceiling is lowered if you pull but even without pulling youre not locked out of anything unfairly if you play the game regularly you can pull regularly thats what the buffs are balanced around just because the banner matches the effect doesnt mean your only option is to pay and i bet most paying players couldnt care less about the endgame effect cycles if you play the game normally you can still play around those effects you can still clear the endgame challenges without them and you arent guaranteed to do any better even if you did get the character the only thing predatory is the limited resin reserves and the fact that youd have to pay for extra this might give someone trouble in building the characters that fit the effect niche if matching new characters to fit certain gameplay effects isnt the case and i assumed it was at least similar because hoyo mechanics are somewhat universal especially between hsr and gsi i dont get how they would even begin to make the endgame revolve around one specific characters ability with each iteration of said endgame cause thats never been the case
is it weird that im the only one not complaining or
im not really sure i see much of an issue with this to be honest since it does only happen once per battle plus it is onlt to make it easier its not mandatory plus in the same patch we can choose to get a free healer at the same time meaning that even if even if someone chooses to not get castorice you still get a healer thats still pretty good i think thats just because i already have most of the healers in game tho
you dont need it to beat end game contents it will make it easier but not mandatory
genshin absolute cinema
the global revive is the slippery slope the hoyo shills refuse to see
slap her with luocha and its ggs endgame not fun anymore
i mean the lore reasoning is obviously why they have that feature but they couldve easily chosen a different one like every member surviving a deadly hit once per battle or something maybe thats a pw for some as well but i think its a lot less so from a gameplay aspect and less cheaty towards death
if you support this you are part of the problem it should be limited to having her on the team it doesnt need to be a global passive to fit her lore as if thats even a reason in the first place it is innovative sure but in a bad way having this global passive sets a bad precedence for future characters especially when theres already evidence found of there being more characters that will have global passives
i think they really want money
are you along with these people mentally rtarded it wouldve been one thing if it was when she was in team making it global means itll universally nerf your acc if you dont want to pull her you cant just bypass her team
i get that it can be lore accurate as but just dont make it global if so then firefly should join the fight as a fifth party member if the trailblazer is on the team
imagine calling something pw in a game that you can clear fp o people are really getting digusting also a game with no pvp p
so whats next zenless zone zero
the problem isnt the passive its self its the precedent though i dont get why power creep it so much if just having a dps bailu for the whole team while shes in it not enough it needs to be even while out of party not to mention the what this may do for enemy power creep and im a pretty big dolphin at this point so ive git skin in the game genuinely design wise its bad to make it this busted this is like a year level ability a game puts in not like what year for star rail
omg you have to roll for a character in a gacha game
i think they are just someone who cant enjoy anything in life
meanwhile i just wanna enjoy the story content
difference in opinion between western and cn is pretty big it is what it is i guess
this will only help either whale who suck at the game which come on really or fp players who really need a revive to get through moc lmao i cant see the pwoercreep lol
bro we literally need that if the moc is beating our asses this bad
hoyo does have a very strong preference to cater to whales and new fps which is their primary demographic of target for almost all their business practices including this global passive the only problem is they have no qualms of fucking everyone else in the middle veteran fps and small spenders to do that even if they dont have to which i believe is the primary criticism most ppl have for hoyo the powercreep lies in the inclusion of global passives as precedent for hp inflation which is alr bad even without it
and that tactic is called the company selling you the solution
that reason they said she is the authority of death thats why she had that global passive is a good excuse not like i support it as long as castorice will be the only character in the entire game who has a global passive bc if they add some unit who have a global passive im done with mihoyos excuses
crazy that castorice is more seele than seele lol
using lore accurate as an excuse is stupid by that logic hoyo can give any character a broken global ability like allow you to know have characters per team and people wont complain as theres a lore reason for it
i can only imagine her passive being useful only in endgame content unless your a new player and you think her passive is op when its really mid then you just suck at the game
who cares about power creep in a singleplayer game
for what this sets for the future of hsr is indeed a bit concerning yes but as soon as i see global passives that buff overall dmg spd crit etc then it becomes a whole another can of worms
cant wait for all the comment that completely miss the point of the complaints and think people are complaining for no reason
its bad plain and simple hopefully its an extremely rare occurrence and should it ever appear again its not something busted like boosting crit rate crit damage damage reduction etc
the fall of hsr is near
if the revive only worked when she is on the team it wouldnt have been a issue and the ability would have still been lore accurate but giving revive just by existing on your account is not good i can see a potential boss coming up who dont shot you once but twice which will make her revive useless and a new character will have double revive passive on them
if hoyo can somehow not be greedier than all sin and make castorice the only character with a global passive it shouldnt be a huge issue but we all know that is not how this is going to go this game speed ran its fall off wtf
next up character gonna boost up your team without present at team i can smell it the strategy
i mean bailu also revives after death once a battle
well just dont die as always
it is really a amazing and cool new feature though i dunno why they hate it well if you cant get her on the first run just wait for the rerun i skipped mydei for her too
i personally think that its a cool mechanic that fits her character but it definitely sets a new bar for even more future powercreep
yall complain about everything at this point
in a game where enemies constantly have higher hp these buff skills can help players win more easily especially for newbies
they should add a switch for this ability so player can turn on and off anytime they want
one think that i still cant get over with these fucking idiots is that it forces them to pull her like my guy you can choose to pull for her or not if you need her global passive then go ahead if you dont need it then skip her its not like hoyo is holding you at gunpoint
what character would make you have a members team based on lore that would make sense xd
felipeabreu hoyo wrote the lore themselves and designed the units themselves there is no limit to how bullshit these passives can get
felipeabreu idk they havent made one yet thats the point they can make a new character with some lore and then give them some op global passive and call it lore accurate duh
its about older units not being able to keep up with new ones this still applies in multiplayer and single player games
wait until its phainon releasing with some busted global passive and they dont want to pull the yucky male character itll be glorious
to be fair its a put the cart before the horses type of situation no matter how you look at it people are mad about something that didnt happen yet but it might happenone day
felipeabreu yea just like others said this complaining is just what if
felipeabreu why would you wait for thing to happen before you start complain at that point it cannot be reverse
nuram_ai dont you insult my boy anyways he will gives atk buff thankfully not the double lightcone one but if its really the double lightcoen and cyrene will gives hp and spd buff thank god not teammate if you want an explanation to the old leaks just ask
youll not die if you dont finish le last moc stage so yes stop complain for no reason
teddyakakpovi and you just proved their point lmaoo
pine_cnecomthe only point he proved is yall complain too much and those who complained better not even think of pulling her when her banner drops if you want to prove a point then do it better boycott the game by not playing not just by simply not spending money on the game
im just finding it funny people are complaining about pay to win in a gatcha as if power creep isnt a thing to promote spending
its a what if situation im not complaining about anything until i see what happens
demoman im also finding it funny that hoyoshills are defending it weve got plenty of gachas out there some handle it better than the others hoyoverse unfortunately is not of that kind
wonderingstxrs i mean its better to complain about something that looks like its about to happen idk apparentely theres leaks of other global passives coming out in like patchws than to wait until you cant do anything about it anymore
cry and whining the ultimatum level are you not tired of yourself
adriantepes idk i feel like all gatcha do this where the newer characters are better i feel this is no difference then robin or acheron being must pulls because of how good they were at release
justasleepyfool but then youre just nit enjoying the game id rather not sour my experience by constantly worrying and complaining about passives that arent even in the game yet and its not like a bunch of passives will make me quit the game either so whats the point i play this game cause i like the characters and lore not for the meta
shreggy oh im not believe me hes the only x char i really really want but its just gonna be funny when the people defending castorice global passive get upset a less popular character gets a useful global buff the chaos will be hilarious
youd be surprised of how much people who actually just complains for no reason and just jumping into the band wagon sure it could be unhealthy for the game and understand that some people will have strong opinions on the matter trust me i play priconne and this kinda global buff is really annoying to play around but the random asshole who just complains about stuff and doesnt know when to shut up or where to shut up are the worst please complain all you want but do not bring it up to your minor circle who are just trying to enjoy the game
wonderingstxrs i mean yeah you do you if you enjoy it go on i already quit the game so i dont really know why im still talking about it lol i hope you continue to enjoy the game
the people not complaining are the same people that have aventurine and tell others that dont have him that they just need to learn to play when they get one shot by a boss
wonderingstxrs lol wait till they use china law that prohibit them from nerfing characters against you
shreggy i love the fanfic passives people are making its peak entertainment i am however somewhat concerned for the people that think its legit
aliceblack heck yeah because of that some people were twisted between the real leak and the fanfic one anyway if theres a healing global passive would it be fun just my idea
shreggy ive seen someone else suggest we could use a th character as a support similar to dan heng vs phantyliaother boss fights having members in the stellaron hunter fight was really fun as well maybe not a global passive but i think being able to use a th character as a support that either lets you use their ultimate or give your team a unique buff would be pretty cool whether its our own character or a friends character
demoman you say pay to win to pve game mode that optional and passive that basicly useless is your building chara properly
adriantepes than just play another gacha lol you can gamble to another game
thfz i say pay to win because handing over money to win at a game is pay to win crazy right almost like the context doesnt matter since what i described it as is accurate
aliceblack yeah that would be fun ngl if theres an event like that i cant wait to play it
is a game buddy go touch some grass
nuram_ai yep still gonna skip
oh ive seen people argue well they give luocharm for free so whats your problem gacha players are galactic level stupid
the passive is broken and its a thing about future characters seele can dodge and slice bullets but we see nothing lore wise made into gameplay
teddyakakpovi queue hoyoshills defending a billion dollar company
dude its a gacha game ofc its pay to win
teddyakakpovi ah yes its fine to not finish end game content reasonits also fine to not pullits also fine to not do dailyits even fkin fine if you dont play the game at all
markus_danger hoyoshill spotted
thelordofanime exactlyy
i will complain when the game introduces a pvp mode otherwise i honestly just see this as a bunch of meta chasers getting mad oh and the usual spice of haters with zero stakes like tectone and gacha snack
hoyohater detected
markus_danger yep its natural to hate a greedy gacha company but its really sad to shill for one
aeririahelmold thats what happens if you get addicted to gambling it happens and they harm anything that lives who hates or hurt their precious billion dollar gambling company which it already happens and its getting extremely worse and worse and hoyoshills are turning a blind eye on them
cmiiw but her global passive doesnt work in moc iirc
demoman well if its paced they would still got revenue from rerun for example how many of players that skip the ones they love in rerun when they know more powerful characters incoming i do hope the buffing old characters would make pulling for rerun worth it instead of punished for doing so
aeririahelmold if you hate this greedy corporation why are you even discussing it and not leaving gacha games its not about protection its about players losing the boundaries of what they should really be afraid of
all of the comments on this guys videos are just glazing devs like i wish we could still like a game but be critical about it when it does something notso great
markus_danger so you think just cause i dont like them i cant talk about them what sense does that make i just think its funny to see people defending companies that dont love them
yeah why is everyone complaining about something that is leading up to defeating the purpose of a turn based strategy game in a turn based strategy game i dont get it xd
they are though
and hoyo still make millions in every patch nothing to worry
kyaa then thats even worse because theyll get away with treating their playerbase like illiterate garbage knowing that those suckers would pay every single cent for a character whos global passive allows for increased crit in the future
noobthenewt how can hoyo give us free pulls in every patch consider as they treat us literally like garbage also they give us free pulls plus free limited character luocha or ruan mei in but still considered as garbage lol thats funny about those suckers u mention its their problem tho since they use their own money nothing wrong with that and global passive characters are not a must pull btw
noobthenewt youll still play anyway
kyaa the fact that stuff like this is considered generous enough to defend hoyo makes me sad as an onlooker
jetkirby i cant imagine if free pulls and free limited character still wasnt consider generous enough people really are greedy tho maybe if hoyo gives free pulls and can choose any free characters in every patch people will say hoyo is generous lol
kyaa how about more things to do in the base game to get pulls
jetkirby just do the events and story mission u will get enough jades to pulls btw
global passive is really powerful effect which you only need her to be existing on your account either you need to fully build her or leave her on lvl i would be really jealous cause i planning to get castorice on her rerun her revive passive should have only when she is on team i really love castorice as she remind me of griseo i really wanna get her but im saving for hyacine
the only sane concern ive read to date about this topic
i got already onshot by the new boss before her passive was known though the real issue is enemies will become harder and harder as long as people can cycle stuff i rather see castorice as an offer to weaker players to maybe offset their subpar relics even after months of farming
how the only we can do that is we must have castorice yep pay to play
okay because you said that suit her lore then make acheron or herta who literally an emanator have the global passive
muhammadhanry dude acheron literally already one shots with her technique and herta doesnt have any lore specific abilities besides being smart
idk_anymore_ woah nothing new here i havent seen power creep happen before thats crazy its almost like the company is made a character just for people to pull on or else they wont have any revenue yep definitely never happened to any other gacha games out there
im_motivatedayato no shit dumbass im just saying that theyve come up with an easy and new potential way to do it now
im_motivatedayato yeah well no sht im just saying that theyve found a potential and easy new way to powercreep now
im_motivatedayato everybody knows that powecreep is unavoidable but it has potential to be even worse
idk_anymore_ herta decimates acheron lore wise
idk_anymore_ you know nothing about herta
only if she have that as normal passive not global
honestly if they want lore accuracy they could have just made it into a story unlockable global passive something like after to her moment in her story she blesses us with something and it helps us in our future troubles making it so that the passive only activates when you have her in your account its just greed
littleswansplaygrownd true a free system for all players would be an amazing addition i dont understand how people are defending this sh
who the fk dont want to complain with special ability behind paywall
but thats the thing hsr is selling you the solution to the problem they made themselves after a while people wont even consider summoning for characters that dont have a global passive and that will damage the game
ishimura i love hsr but as a game it doesnt require skill like genshin and zz where youre running around causing reaction and assists and all that
nothing is pay to win or a must have when its all solely just for the singular player convenience if they want it or not
idrc so long as i have it and i will i have guaranteed idc if future characters have it so be it ill benefit from the global passive even if other ppl dont its a pve game anyways
ill keep playing because i like the game and its challenging but im not pulling for any characters with global passives ill let those rot
soi hope there is a disable toggle for the passive or in certain content there is a spell field that disables that passive i swear they about to release challenge mode where the boss kill your first characters forcing you to put a healer in th slot to revive the rest of your characters and if you dont have castorice rip your characters and it will absolutely brick any guide makers and recomended team comps team comps imagine a comp only works with castorice passive and without it it wont work
everyone should be pulling anyway regardless of the kit theres a literal dragon
just pull for her lmao cuz u get tons of pulls for her
sure pw in a non pvp game people are just overreacting
i just ignoring them because they are full of drama
ppl really didnt get it yes it revive the character but on hp that means if you dont have heal right away youre fucked either way
if players support this hoyo gonna us this opportunity to milk more money yeah this game become shitty as f
if they nerf it to where its only if shes in the party its a great ability that works wonderfully with her lore
all that matters is what cn thinks hoyo doesnt give a fuck about what we want in the us so if cn likes this then its going to happen and honestly cn is such a brainwashed community of gamers that they happily eat and swallow shit on a constant basis
honestly i think some people are like kids who crave candy if they get candy they take it for granted but if they dont they blame you for not listening to their request
yeah if you guys dont like it send feedback about it dont say useless and equate other devs giving lots of criticism is very good but dont take hate as criticism thats different i remind you spreading hate will add to problems not solve them tbh i also dont like that global thing because of that tbf if anything is unclear please correct me
bruh castorice revive is just insurance to be clear it doesnt help you better when you play in any mode characters after resurrecting they can still die next turn if not healed or shielded afterwards so sustain still has an irreplaceable role
if some people really see this as an ok feature what will become of hsr if they add more global passives
if you dont like it just dont pull her its not a must its a choice for me that was just lore wise passive many people want lore wise character they made one and players still fxxking complain if you think it a must have youre just dont like to play hardly as other player that seriously without even getting meta characters you build whatever you want and paypull for whatever you want just shut the fxx up toxic if you dont want to pay to get hersupport hoyoverse youre just someone that same as feminist that want equal rights even though work lazier equal right only for peoples that do equal things not for fxxing people that always complain
well yeah if the revive was not global its still pretty good but the fact that even you bench castorice and you just have her in your inventory makes it op just waiting to activate the passive
i find it weird that people think this forces you to pull for her no it doesnt as an fp you will be perfectly fine if you dont have this global passive which isnt even good tbh if you genuinely feel forced then that means youre either terrible at building your characters and cant clear anything or you just have a gambling addiction maybe this does set a precedent for global passives yes but until we see what another one looks like im not complaining at all
acheron also makes endgame content easier by skipping the battle and instantly kills enemies yet no one seems to complain about it since her debut
usually i would agree but gacha games are a special case since they are live service games that constantly get content updates this can easily spiral into you cant even clear the main story without broken character anymore then yes it would be pw obviously the chance of that happening is pretty low but never say never hoyo isnt very good at balancing and they already had to nerf main story bosses in the past because casuals couldnt clear them
my account was pure ass up till feixaio so i question how people had trouble beating the adventurine and sunday boss fight when i could no problem lol dont remember if sunday was one of the bosses that got nerfed
idk i never fought them prenerf fact is the bosses were too hard for a lot of people or else hoyo wouldnt have nerfed them theres a lot of factors playing into the difficulty sunday was immidiately x easier when you had aventurine on your team for example idk what counts as account being pure ass for you
thats the thing she is a cool and unique character so everyone should pull her the passive is the added bonus to her kit and someone who is not pulling is just dumb and missing out big time
bibekdasyymg gotta be the most shill comment ive ever seen so youre saying we can no longer pull on who we want we have to pull castorice or else suffer for having free will
agreed
pay to play
not trying to be mean or toxic here genuine question are you really blind to the real reason ppl are complaining
this is honestly what most people want
they wont test servers are closed
would also make her of characters who do that
improvmanzero bailu her and who else
probably e fuxuan
gustavojua whatever otto is calling himself
gustavojua its huo huo at a certain eidolon she gains a revive that can be used twice per battle
this is what im thinking too
stop fucking saying the same damn thing
ceereal fuxuan e also revives teammates
so its literally just bailu then yeah no thanks
unfortunately they cant nerf her anymore because they would get sued in china that bridge has been crossed
usersmkhbph i think you mean fortunately
thats just a passive then
britishraidenshogun you have to heal the character that is revived with her passive iirc because they just die again once the passive runs out
britishraidenshogun idk if you meant to tag me but i didnt say anything about it being strong in fact you could probably infer i think it isnt super powerful from the fact that its a revive with an extra step
thats what fu xuan has
britishraidenshogun its not because of the revive a lot of people think its because of her having a global passive that hoyo will use more and more in the future and using that as a new selling point for characters power creeping old characters and making you feel stupid for pulling for old characters and forcing you to pull new characters again cause characters with global passives is the new meta
britishraidenshogun actually it isnt imagine this alright you take a month break from hsr and you come back but issue is that the pervious banner characters give global passives to which you need to clear x content since without it the content is impossible it forces you to pull cause you will always be at a disadvantage compared to everyone who did pull for the global
naxmaxjk so most people that dont want to pull her wants this global passive removed no one wants their characters weaker if they gonna pull them in the end its a mostly single player game so balance isnt really that important
britishraidenshogun mean atp they should do that if they decide to keep the global trend cause then it would make it pay to win and not fp friendly
britishraidenshogun also i dont think i would have an issue with it being only a team but i have an issue when its global cause it doesnt make sense since why does it have to be global there is no reason to make an impactful gameplay design to which hurts the overall experience for everyone
britishraidenshogun see the problem is how many runs didnt you see that it took how much investment is in each of those characters thats where this all lays and how string does a character need to be to be relevant does a character need a passive so strong its global at this point in the game no lets be honest
britishraidenshogun the problem isnt the revival its the precedence it sets for global passives whats stopping a character from having a passive global damage up for your team for the whole fight
dahaoren dude people are obviously concerned with the fact there are global passives in the first place because whats stopping another character from having one thats actually gonna cause a ridiculous power spike for example attack up for your whole team for the whole battle or better yet you get energy regen every turn for everybody maybe a maximum health boost all the time are you seeing the bigger picture here this is like a year gatcha game ability thrown in at like year what or
i dont think global passives will be designed to be that powerful like giving attack even if it will give some buff it will probably be not as huge and there will probably be some limitations if there are way too many global passivesfor example only one global passives can be selected per team or something similar this rez for example i rarely die in even the hardest content its really not that useful and wont hurt if you dont have it if the developers dont put any limitations on that i dont think anyone will be happy i dont think they are that stupid to ruin their game completely im not that concerned about this disclaimer im just saying this is what my thoughts and expectations are not saying im going to be correct
dahaoren but do you honestly think itll have a one global active at a time effect restraint in the first place would be them restricting this effect to just while shes on the team and even if it doesnt whats stopping this from becoming something like future characters on field ability to be permanent to the team is slots and not the characters so you can essentially always have their ability trigger while not having them on the team this just feels like a slippery slope for no real benefit especially cause people always complained about moc so now the question of scaling comes up and thats a whole nother can of worms cause if you make more than one global and multiple can be active how do you balance it for the haves and have nots
its a gacha game you just dont balance it
true i also thought of it like that at first but a passive that works even shes not in a team is just blatant paywin
im even okay with this
phainon probably will have crit rate global buff considering how strong in lore he is now and he will be the nd character to have global buff since hoyo will make at least global buffer for each new region after this
and completely shits on the already existing character who had the only revive in the game further making older characters garbage what a win
yes this is much better than the global passive still aligned with her lore and wonct just break the game
gacha game not pay to win yeah you wish gacha game trying to made money from that
why would they make it like bailu if i were to pull ofc id prefer global buff like this
fatestarrail the global passives are absolutely some of the worst forms of greed and power creep a gacha game has ever seen it is not good for the game
yall were gonna pull for either way take the better passive
with hp and dies again if not healed or hit again
there is literally content that forces you to pull a character they have the game to where even stars can clear everything relatively easily
danroe lol no they do not you dont have to pull characters but this character literally requires building to be a game changing character and that is a horrible thing to do to game balance go try and clear the end game moc with only star heroes go on try it post your results why you are at it it should be interesting
welt should be one of the strongest his power is black hole
britishraidenshogun i cant help but think that you are the type of person who will agree with whatever the government determines and tell others to back off or leave the country if they dont agree
britishraidenshogun thats fine however most of those who complaining only purely concern about what hoyo is trying to do just to make more money so they will add something unnecessary just to make people want more and dont get me wrong im still pulling for castorice regardless i just cant help but think its pretty obvious that hoyo knows if they do this they will get more people to pull for her honestly it doesnt have to be this way
britishraidenshogun if i skip her then i wouldnt get the gp the gp the char all of this is good so if those char came out then it will indirectly force me to pull for her then what she gets powercreep just like that my money wasted its the same as old characters that gets powercreep its not her kitglobal passive that everyone hate its how this game would turn out if the gp released
britishraidenshogun give me a link where standard belobog only char clears the moc then
britishraidenshogun no link yeah i thought so
britishraidenshogun who said i wanna skipdont u read my comment i really want her kit gp so bad i literally asking mr wallet permission u know read again
britishraidenshogun cmon bro be honest theres literally no video of that and the only thing that youre copying are my words i feel like i arguing with a kid now
britishraidenshogun where is it theres nothing in comment section thats for sure u know how to give links right
britishraidenshogun i think youre capping theres literally no link in comment try using youre nd acc or smth to check
britishraidenshogun u can give the title because theres no blade videos only seele when i searched and the video has sunday in it so no count
britishraidenshogun no response keep running with your so called truth lmao i doubt it even exist
britishraidenshogun so its clear now that u dont have the video cuz u keep avoiding youre wasting my time u couldve told me sooner if u dont have the video u lost the debate
britishraidenshogun i looked at your channel and saw you post abt u replying to people with dmb comments do u enjoy being dmb lol also sunday is a character weirdo
improvmanzero its not about the revive its about the fact that it happens when shes not in your team
usersmkhbph yep only way to fix the balance issue would be to give everyone a free copy which they wont do because shes their big seller for the region were well and truly cooked
britishraidenshogun its the precedent it sets now its a somewhat mid revive ability but in the future you will have to pull characters to get some flat atk buff or crit buff across all teams for your entire account what happens when its a character you dont like and dont want to pull you will be forced to anyways or your entire account is some percent weaker than every other players even greedy gacha companies that do global buffs dont attach them to limited characters theyre usually in some passive skill tree or something
britishraidenshogun cap give the video and i believe u
britishraidenshogun if u do dmb things anyone would drag abt it for exp brag drag anyone would point that out
sandstimes ok that is broken
ok so the og comment is from my alt and wtf everyone yall chill none of this is that deep also stop the name calling yall need to be respectful just cause we all strangers and have a relative form of anonymity doesnt mean that we get to forget human kindness
britishraidenshogun still no video keep capping
britishraidenshogun irrelevant or not dmb still dmb
britishraidenshogun still no video the only thing that ure post are your dmb reply and that shows a lot lol
britishraidenshogun problem its just some yt comment the only problem are ur dmb brain lol
britishraidenshogun yt does get rid of links sometimes but stop engaging with this other person theyre immature
bababoey what are you cut the year old insults and please debate as an adult or quit talking
kaiyaastral nah bro till heshe shows the link i aint taking this serious depends on ur reply i might think ur the nd acc and pretend to be someone else
im the alt to the original commenter as stated earlier plus i really dont care if you take the argument seriously doesnt give you a right to be disrespectful
kaiyaastral if ure truly someone else than read our whole conversation then start replying if u dont want then dont reply therell be no point calling people immature are also insult ur just do what ur prohibit me to do nothing personal though
ive read it all youre both being ridiculous its a silly game theres no need to be getting so aggressive
britishraidenshogun keep capping
kaiyarichiess honestly if they want it to be lore they could have made it so that its a story unlockable passive thats obtainable by every player something like after her big moment in the story she becomes some sort of an eternal ally to the express and her blessing helps us in our future travels hell i wouldnt mind being reminded of the belobog folks with their passive
this is peak hoyoverse players description
but the complaints about her are valid stop meat riding multimillion dollar companies that dont care about you
_lluvjuess the only complaints being valid is that it makes no sense for her ability to apply when she isnt on the team everything else isnt since it aint pay to win since its single player just get good if you suck at something ability it took op just a nice bonus so calling her ability broken is exaggerated
have fun when the future chars released that you dont wanna pull for give cdmg global passive she absolutely can revive and its a good passive that fits her character but why the need for it outside her team shes not even a healer
livingwarrobots it becomes pay to win when they scale enemy stats to the point that the only logical way to get through the stat sticks is to forgo the sustain and go allin on damage with risking it all on rng with an additional turn using the passive for the final stretch unlikely to happen but worst case scenario there is possibility of the situation reaching that point with the power creep where you need that additional investment to keep up pay to win isnt a matter of single or multi player at all it is about whether you can actually clear the content with what you are given for free
remembrance can be anything cuz it has no specific role
tch tch tch ignorant hoyoshill do you think that global passive wont be a problem it will be a problem because hoyo wont even bother about game balance they only care how much money will make
livingwarrobots her ability is broken and it opens up the possibility for other characters with similar abilities to be added which would break make it even harder for none meta players its a big issue and people are allowed to complain you need to understand that people are going yo have opinions and that not everyone is a a yes man thats going to agree with everything characters like castorice are legit going to ruin the game unless you are pay to win
_lluvjuess i played war robots to refresh my mind of how mobile games behave you have every bit to be worried about but to my defense i forgot how bad they truly are i played steam and forgot the greed of mobile
thats completely fair i havent been playing hoyo games as im burnt out from all the grinding but yeah hoyo is an incredibly greedy company who doesnt even do the bare minimum with rewards considering theyre a multimillion dollar company its sad to see once again that theyre feeding into ptw and making the meta harder for ftp players
_lluvjuess its always greed that ruins the nice things
i agree its really sad
hoyo never listen hoyo doesnt care
kelvincostner buzzer spotted
brillian send feedback have you ever heard yourself or aware of what have been player since genshin doing in its four years in existence and they fking know whats wrong but are lazy to fix it feedbacks mean nothing to them just toilet paper they will wipe their butt with they tgaf about your opinion if it doesnt benefit their revenue devs misheard
yup see mydei who can revive several times in a match but eventually can die
her mechanic isnt to busted but they dropping saber with a global passive thats a actual damage buff
the problem isnt the effect of the passive but the mechanic in itself yeah a free revive is fine but what is its a damage boost or a crit rate boost or a passive heal then every single character you have become worse is you dont pull for the characters with these passives
finiraelkhami we actually getting one from saber like imagine if you dont get her and they start balancing for people with the global passives
i was like you when i play hi guess what i got left behind because i dont have must have characters and my progress become slow and stuck look at them now im afraid hsr will be next
kelvincostner no bro there are no must have characters just play better till today im still using my blade and hit k damage hes not meta anymore but still ok if youre good at using him just play better using characters you have just get good with your characters i also play hi never had any problem that you have sounds like a skill issue to me
and by then it will be too late
edpaolosalting already too late
wonderingstxrs om my god you are a very wonderful person who actually uses their brain
im_motivatedayato even if there are more global passive in the future there is still no disadvantage to it
xeenoo the community cant make up its mind they complain that new characters are weak but if they make the new character strong they complain they make is bland and the same as the last one they complain no wonder hoyo aint listening
hoyo casually locking new modes or entire games behind new characters by because people are complacent with them
jetkirby delusional
jetkirby fyi you cant predict the future so none of what you said is remotely credible
all you have to do is observe the actions of the company and its playerbase
jetkirby sure the divine foresight
jetkirby that still doesnt mean you can tell the future if the world worked like that we wouldnt be having most of the problems were having now
if everyone is so complacent with this its not that surprising itll continue
jetkirby and it will change nothing gacha is just a gambling coated with beautiful characters and animations at the end of the day youre the one who decides whether you will be spending or not
are you new to gacha games or really low iq genshin has been around like almost years now or more the new character always suits moc and other game modes theres gonna be a boss or game mode whose gonna hit very hard that will one shot your million hp fu xuan adventurine or whatever sustain unit you have prob will have an insta kill so you basically need that unit or have god level gear something most fps wont have ive played for years with the battle pass and it took months to get god level gear for one char most of my char have efficient gear imagine fp with less resources plus this isnt the main problem its what comes next units that give permanent stat boost or maybe even skip moc itself someone said it was crazy it isnt for hoyo they make billions but barely update their game for qol other than zz writing bloat is so bad stories always suck unless its zz so many missions for little stellar jadesgemspolychrome whatever
ogbobbyjohnson sure divine foresight as always worrying about nothing youre worrying about your self made boss that will never see the light of the day fortunately youre not a game designer
what are you even talking about is english your first language what ive said has nothing to do with what youre saying what ive said is facts and proven since day in genshin and years plus hoyo makes problems then sells the solution thats how you make money its basically a scheme they make billions and people dont care well they do now isnt it obvious every char they released was towarded moc or abyss thats the problem they sell the character as a solution do i have to explain something so basic why do you think they make billions next global passive is moc for lore reasons its not out of the possibility its prob like chance theres a pattern if you didnt even see because youre smooth brained archeron passive kills enemies without fighting next glbal passive instant revive again something so basic you couldnt see it coming
ogbobbyjohnson actually no ive been playing for a while now year and im an fp player ive played genshin zz and hsr in all of these games i only pull for the characters i like whether theyre op or not ive also built lots of star star standard teams which have cleared endgame content iust fine when built properly ive almost never completely die to a boss either so maybe next time instead of assuming someones experience with a topic think clearly before running your mouth or keyboard in this case also getting steller jades and polychromes have been fairly easy for me zz being the easiest i should show you my account for that one also it seems like youre projecting none of what you said proves that castorice is a must pull you will do fine without her i promise
yeah honestly global passives will not matter unless you really plan on cycling moc which doesnt matter in the slightest im guessing this is a one time thing as the anniversary character for the patch but nobody can truly tell until we actually see it somewhere else so no more complaining just waiting is all we can do before making real statements
finally someone with a clear mind im tired reading all those mindless comments cycle worshippers only make it worse they are soo dramatic
maybe cause you actually need to have her equipped not to mention its really limited and drains technique points they also limited in the su by making items in conundrum nonexistent so you have to really savor points castorice on the other hand is a free restrictionless revive across your entire account just for having her it would be a different story if having acheron allowed all characters to insta kill enemies regardless of her being on the team but thats not the case is it
they will at least add more characters to the spirit shop in the future i guess
if it doesnt work in the endgame then that passive is fine but it works there thats the problem
in other words if youre poor just admit it and let the rich play
i dont give enough shit i play the story i was like level when i arrived in penacony and amphorius and i just pull for the characters who i like like tribbie
if your characters are dying in the first place then you need to re evaluate how you play tne game the global passjbe wont do anything for peecent of players
casto passive wont even help you clear endgame easier the problem is what people expect for the future global passive that it might come you really dont have any reason to pull for casto passive alone
if it ties into lore acheron should also have a similar ability and so should many others like the herta and welt it should be changed not removed to only work if she is on the team like with bailu
what if there are more characters with global passives in the future but you can only have one at a time
the game doesnt have pvp the west is overdoing things so europes words are worthless
well now time to pack up guys hsr had a good run
the problem is not with this characters abilities but with the upcoming characters who will have the same abilities or better ones
meanwhile us veteran fgo players had to wait a whole year or maybe nver for a rerun with no guarantee or pity to get that servant even with a pity system introduced you still cant get that pity as it doesnt bring the pity on other banner
so many dumb comments in this post is insane either too dumb to understand or delusional in general this sht raise a concern that hsr community is just full of undeveloped braincell npcs
you know what for what i know if only castorice will have that kind of ability as broken as acheron was in i would not mind its not confirmed if hyacine would have such global passive anyway
the next character is probably the god of speed and it gives us global speed
seriously castorice is really good thing cause she can revive all who ones are down and theres bailu can revive only one character who are down
its ok if only one character have this
this will be needed cuz how current boss has higher hp and can wipe out entire team
i think they are testing how people will receive this new feature
i hope now they understand why genshin could never has a positive response lol
the vast majority of the players which are casuals from what i heard doesnt really care about the whole situation and its mostly the vocal minority or hardcore players of this game that is complaining its not like the passive itself is broken because she does drain hp of your allies which balances it out but rather it will set a bad precedent for future characters of this game like global crit dmg or speed etc if they just simply give it to castorice and not everyone else then its fine but if they implement global passives in the future it would be smart for them to give it to the mc and not premium paid characters
if it was they would have to say it in castorices kit
in hi you had weapons that activated passives called divine keys
they would have to specify that or its against cn consumer laws
it wont happen how else are they going to sell the characters if the global passive wont stack lmfao
you dont even need castorice plus the revive isnt anything special at all
yusei maybe rn yes but its the future that im worrying about she will be the domino effect to something even more worse
my gut feeling tells me that its not gonna be pretty in the future
lmao and youll still keep playing i know your kind of people keyboard warriors
justpsistmultivtuberapost is this the first time if so then your speculation is based of nothing basically
livingwarrobots is this the first time no silver wolf who gives elemental weakness which bypass a game mechanic then followed up by boothill then firefly fugue who bypasses elemental weakness toughness bypassing a game mechanic now we bypassing party effect limit good riddance
its really helpful in simulated and divergent universe bro dont u know how strong the last difficulty is it has more hp than normal bosses so with this revive u still have a chance to get a comeback and win
randomviewer and thats the problem
no we do not i uninstalled hsr deleted from library hoyo is ruining their game as our pleas fall on deaf ears the pattern is there hoyo is slowly killing all of their games because they hear us but decide to do other things we saw that with genshin zz etc
reyzer zz is doing just fine they listened to alot of feedback in the past and they still do
reyzer sadly we lose one of our fav player the next day hello a couple hundreds of new players hsr always got the new player nothing to lose btw
byee
justpsistmultivtuberapost please do leave and never return
justpsistmultivtuberapost oh yeh cuz acheron one shotting normal enemies is just ok
agony exactly and watch people who are the ones who complained also pull for the character
reyzer please never reinstall or even watch any hoyo content ever again thank you
justpsistmultivtuberapost i love how whatifs are the reason for leaving lol
reyzer bro no one cares if you leave i love how those leaving are acting like gods or saviors being like im leaving the game good riddance hsr and people are like okay bye
i left this bs back when sunday came
this aint an airport
thatsaber good eos is gonna roll up eventually
im_motivatedayato sure thing i dont want to have to do anything with them thanks for the advice
carlzxceeds good riddance
kyaa to not believe the game could eos some day of ther mediocrity is delusional but keep telling yourself whatever you believe in
justpsistmultivtuberapost but is a disadvantage to your account
megumin and the problem here is people really surprised with global buff i mean theres another game that has global buff way before hsr even the buff was way more brutal its a game changer but not locked up by a character for a lazy person that buff was hell for me to unlock
kyaa good on being their cash cow
reyzer if u dont want to play just quit no one forces u to play btw people keep hating on everything nowadays lol
christophealexander hoyo literally give free pulls in every patch and in we got free pulls also extra rewards in events no need to spend a single penny btw
you guys act like whole game is moc there is actually people that want to get characters and play the story and event oh no i couldnt clear moc big deal no jades people shouldnt complain when there is aura farmers clearing it with arlan
damn there is alot of hoyo shill bot down here
randomviewerin those modes you will be revived a lot of times due to blessings and stuff before castorice pasive cam activate
randomviewer that helpful is the problem its only helping players that have her by winning or whaling
yusei ill be honest this is something that i havent seen in any gacha game before gaining an enormous buff to your account just by the character existing idk man its kinda scary it gives precedent when a huge successful gacha game did this bs and getting away with it
justpsistmultivtuberapost were not even sure theyll release some really broken global passive in the future and if they did cn community will prob do something tho
yuuya castoria in fgo
okay see ya
agony just wait to see when they announce characters with busted global passive back to back just for u to struggle
randomviewerits becuz of this type of powercreep and buff they are increasing the bosses hp and now after castorice wait to see a million hp boss
yusei well about that since castorice is here hoyo will definitely buff the enemies hp by like million or more cause shes too op which makes it harder for people achieve moc without having her
this
so youre comparing shit with shit stain
is it another character with similar passives
howorwhat whos gonna tell em
kingjthe shh
kingjthe nothing wrong with that bruh
kingjthe tell us now
add more to make it
next one will be the god of life it heals your entire party by every time anyone gets a turn
wow thats crazy cant wait to get that
seekerth its not phainon hycaine and safer have been leaked to have global passives
create the problem sell the solution people dont understand after castorice the game is going to get harder
agnesfodornevarga nah not really
its a slippery slope plus there is zero reason why it should work when shes not in your team
the problem isnt about how strong the passive is its about the fact that more passive like this even more powerful will be coming out soon
people give it too much importance for a single player game
ahahah imagine crying on a single player game that dont even have pvp and crying for meta how pathetic these people
were gonna get some bs like crit damage passive in like a year or two lmfao
im not going to complain untill the second global passive comes so we can see how they are treated i imagine their going to only let you have one global passive active so your not benefiting from different passives
for genshin players this is like barbara and qiqi c work without them being on the team
so wait if castrice is not in the team the team still get revive thats almost like that requires to certain characters
my wifeyy
dead game
i think one thing they could do is make the passive activating count as a character falling in battle
if you dont want the global passive then dont pull for her easy
girl a hp revive isnt forcing people to pull its useless and you shouldnt even be dying to begin with
hahaha stop playing hoyo game bro theyre suck move to other game bro
when she is in the team then yeah its good but its a goblet passive which whos to say future characters wont do the same
when the best anniversary gift would have been hoyoverse sayinf that theyre making the weapon banner be guaranteed and instead we just got this
its better version of bailu in which you dont even need her in the team
if you think this is a opinion topic you have lost already
both it is lore equivalent it is unique but its also busted as hell those two things are not mutually exclusive
if you wanna make global passive just make it not tight with character
impact holy glaze acting like people werent constantly complaining about loot boxes like years ago dare i say diablo immortal
impact just your a gacha tourist
kingjthe lmao i play gacha since and i play hoyo games since and am i a gacha tourist lmao in my years of gacha games i have never cared for meta and i didnt have any problems
impact thats a not a long time what i dont care how you flex you wasted hours hsr is the first hoyo game of its kind where power creep has been this bad and has mattered this much hi was really just a experiment game never played ggz because im not a creep gi is a dead game and power creep takes forever and zz is fine boothill literally got made obsolete in like patch the game is now closer to eos now than ever before go ahead defend your billion dollar company
kingjthe lmao you are just a meta slave crybaby powercreep this powercreep that ahahah cry for powercreep because you cant beat single player mobs lmao ggz i always used first trio until the game eos hi i always used hor since her release until today genshin i always main keqing since until today hsr i still main seele silverwolf until today and zz i still use soldier anby lucy until today and i dont have any problems only meta slaves make drama for everything ohh noo new character is stronger that is powercreep now my character is useless ahaha how pathetic
kingjthe lmao your is just a metaslave behaviour imagine crying for meta because you cant beat mobs in a single player game where there is no ranking neither pvp lmao ohh noo new character is stronger that is powercreep and now my current main is useless ahaha how pathetic with ggz i used first trio until the game eos hi i main hor since her release until today gi i main keqing since until today hsr i main seele and jingliu until today zz i main soldier until today also for other games too like pgr wuwa nikke fatego never fucking cared about meta characters unlike metaslaves crybabies that crying for powercreep for every new characters lmao
fluskar whos gonna tell em
it still sets a precedent of them purposely attaching a desirable passive like a crit buff to a character hoyo knows will not sell well even if it means little in the overall scope it still feels like a low jab
alliffplayz you lack future vision
it is what it stands for hyacine has already been leaked to give absurd speed buffs phianon is leaked to have global damage
kingjthe those arent confirmed might as well wait to see them officially
wonderingstxrs nope they dont remove global passives when the kits get fully leaked its soft confirmed
meh its no biggie i wont pull her either imma go all out for acheron more eidolon to e her
i think castorices buff should only apply if shes on a team and only for that team
as op as it looks it does have some flaws like if the res timing isnt right and the enemy take turn after the res then the ally would still die and if the enemy is faster which is true according for the next moc itd be hard to heal the revived ally right after the res and ofc the healer would carry more than the global passive most of the concerns are about the precedent about future meta shift which is understanable cuz it could change the premise of the team building like imagine if its spd buff or true dmg or weakness implant those passives would change the way of the gameplay but if its something like dmg buff i think the main kit of the character would have heavier value than the global buff and ofc they should limit the amount of global passives that we can use in the future cuz imagine if all of those passives stacked together in a battle
the problem yall is that it doesnt lie within the passive its what other people think i  think her passive is already enough and can still be power crept considering that she only revives our teammates in hp instead of like at least half of hp or full but with all that aside the passive is already good enough they just have to balance it out simply by just removing the passive activating even when shes not in the team edit the patch hasnt released fully yet so making conclusions and assumptions is not good
if you can beat endgame just fine no need to pull no bodys forcing you to pull for her i dont get why people are so brain dead
i mean when was hsr not pay to win the meta changes like every patches the only reason i couldnt continue playing hsr was that i am strictly fp the meta is not consistent and old characters become unplayable in the endgame
i am legit now in the belief that they just cannot listen even after all the test they have decided to make this final i have no idea why they want to do this outside of money but i guess really ticking off your player base is probably worth it
a western video game sells you xp boosters battle passes and an option to unlock the entire map and everybody loses their mind a chinese video game lets you gamble to potentially unlock a character who lets you cheat death and people online hust eat it up every time
i mean lets be honest its not as if shes gonna be the only one who has this mechanic
first of all this is a gacha game it was designed so that people would donate secondly crying about powercreep when you cant get jade from highgame which is difficult in purpose is kinda pathetic her global passive itself is mid many argue about this mechanic because doomposters among whom there may be wuwa fans say that in the future there will be even more characters with this feature this is just speculation and even if it turns out to be true remember acheron and her technique that allows you to skip battles with mobs and how it caused whining so what now shes still a good dd but not a must pull and if thats not enough look at hi where global passives divine keys are commonplace
for lore approved but for in gameuuhh
i think alot of players are acting like its the end of the world her passive isnt going to blow sustain units out of the water edit i fully acknowledge the fact that it might ruin future global passive but im just using an example
its genuinely not as bad as people make it out to be global passives themselves could be a problem but this one specifically is not such a big deal imo
at this point global passives will be a thing so what im now asking is way they can balance having global buffs make it that only global buff can be active at a time just so players wont have to feel like they have to pull all characters that stacks up all at once and it will give players some time to save for a future character with a different passive
yay hoyo i want money
there are two problems the passive works even when she isnt in the team which just doesnt make sense the revive is ok if shes on the team because her play style is risky theres the possibility that future characters will get even more absurd global passive like permanent stat bonuses also it has the chance to spread not just to hoyo games but other gacha games too the severity of this can best be understood if a very widely detested character like aglaea had a global passive like spd or something essentially forcing you to consider characters you otherwise dislike edit the castorice glazers have arrived lol i just want to say pull any character you want please its the only thing stopping this game from turning into a wasteland of meta slaves a game is made not only by the devs but also the community but im afraid that a lot of people are seeing the hsr devs not fully listening to the community and a certain sect of the community defending the devs at all costs this kind of behaviour will just ruin the game in the long run and nobody wants that to happen
i guess i should be lucky for not doing endgame content then
blah blah blah yall talking about precedent and how hoyo might potentially hypothetically be greedy but there already is a preceent and we can see how it played out in hi it wasnt that bad at all sure it gives a competitive edge but thats because of how the games leaderboards work
its not even pay to win you arent forced to pull her
its just horse armor its just skins its just loot boxes its just battlepasses its just for c furina
with another global passive right
hp is enough for luocha auto heal proc
marczhu yeah that works thank goodness hoyo didnt go too far from this
wanheavenlyweapon hp does not matter any characters that get revived from it are immune to death until they get healed or get a shield you people are misunderstanding how her revive works and why it is such a problem that its a global passive so yes hoyo did go too far
xenowars yea and when the player fails to heal or shield that revived character they become downed immediately i agree that hoyo might gone too far that passive is already good though but we have to remove the passive activating even when shes not in the team that would balance it the end
bruh of course user having castorice profile gonna defend this
come on think outside of the box if your passive can do easily be powercrept you dont think there will be stronger passives your pfp is showing
the issue is the precedent this sets not the fact its actually broken we all know this isnt the last time hoyo is going to implement this hell just take a look at hi where divine keys the equivalent of global passives are extremely common among units its more brain dead to think this isnt an issue at all
ronreed people still play hi and arent really complaining from what i can see so hoyo mightve found a way to make it balanced
yeah like we dont know what they do in endgame bosses nowadays where you literally cant kill it with x cr jingliu lmao
im fp as well and i clear endgame just fine with old characters they arent unusable
thats their problem they first listen but the words come out of the second ear what this means well they decide to hear but later ignore players feedback they do this with surveys hear what players have to say but later decide to not do what asked or or they do another game with those changes that no one asked for that is hoyo is slowly killing its own games because they would rather be blind and deaf to problems than to solve them
acheron tech is literally just qol i nvr understood why so many ppl like you like to use this as your argument when its not even remotely close to powercreep implications that castorices global passive has when its all but confirmed that it can be used in endgame also your argument abt the precedent of stronger global passives being merely speculation really are you such a kind soul to give a fomoheavy company like this the benefit of the doubt even if stronger global passives attached to future characters turns out to not be a mustpull it still feels like shit at this point its not about the jades anymore its abt hoyo not respecting your investments and game progression all for the sake of their profits they are literally telling veteran fpssmall spenders to fuck off or pay up
you missed the point the point is that this allows for other more broken global buffs in the future just as increased speed talent level skill point etc just like how silverwolf allowed them to make boothill firefly anaxia etc
someone needs to develop their brain because he is clearly too dumb to get involved or raise his opinion in this matter
its not there yet but there will be there in the future where some characters with global passive straight up giving shield and healing and from there you wont even need sustain or support anymore
graesongill until we get a character who has global passive that heals you and another one that gives you free cr then youll have so many icons on your screen thatd you think youre playing league of legends
the issue is this could be the start of them doing this more more and more buffs or perks from characters just for existing and if you dont have these characters you are losing out on massive benefits i mean cas literally gives you a safety net per battle just for owning her
what i find problematic as well is how this will shape the kind of bosses we get patches onward like what if the bosses just straight up one shots your character through shield and mitigation having this revive is not only convinient but is required as well
komodo tbf boothill and fireflys work best on mono physical or mono fire teams now anaxas is more broken as allows one to have a more diverse team
theres really no issue its just hating hoyo is meta
i dont think they would do that
ik just like how everyone was asking to removerework castorices passive hoyo will probably ignore this idea too
statwise buffs wont be happening the global passives are likely to be limited to enemy debuffs and bad sustain but usable sustain
arivrsal might happen thohoyo is scummy
very widely detested bro how is aglaea widely detested if you wanted a character to use as an example of a hated character you couldve used jade
arivrsal so youre saying something like permanent def shred yeah no still doesnt sound any better
it aint that deep bro js get good
facelessstarcarver nope aglaea is hated a lot the amount of hate you perceive naturally depends on the kind of content you seei say this as an aglaea main myself i used aglaea as an example purely because it was most of the castorice glazers who were hating on her and using castorice as the reason they were skipping her
youre living in whatifs
youre correct theres a possibility so far shes the only one and the anniversary character of the game so im guessing were not gonna see anything similar until x if you dont like her mechanics just dont pull
francee__ its could be worse if they consider its into scaling of the difficulty make all the mod even harder because of thats passive ability
francee__ considering that the main stars of the show phainon and cyrene will be coming in x i doubt well have to wait long also the fandom can be extremely hypocritical sometimes if they do implement the global passive and then decide to never do something like that again there would be outcry on why the most significant characters of the plot didnt have an overpowered ability
makisky its all fun and games as long as its a character youre simping over isnt it
also they could make a bullshit boss design that could one shot your entire active party
facelessstarcarver crazy that thats the thing you focus on help
dissapearamongtheseaofbutter i dont know its unlikely considering stat based relics like needing low speed for the full effect statwise buffs throw those put of place
silverarrow ohh i see that makes sense im an aglaea main too so i was a bit confused thanks for the clarification
the revive is good and all but not gamebreaking with good sustain the revive is irrelevant for the most part just like how bailu revive and huohuo revive accessed via eidolons sure you can use it without sustain and be revive for an extra turn with hp but imagine its the boss turn it downed a character in your team and it still has a turn most bosses has turn then that revived character is good as dead to answer you first question yes it doesnt make sense that she can revive even without her being on the team but dont forget that castorice will basically become a demi god in this upcomimg patch to answer your second question this global passive is probably just a one time gimmick because it will be the nd anniversary of hsr but theres also a chance that this would be a thing in the future and it up to the devs whether they want to cause more powercreeping to their game call this a copium or whatever i enjoy the game and its story is all that matters
so bad faith argument only ok
omg the jade stans coming for you facelessstarcarver
people hate aglaea
meh even if they add a damage for a character i dont like i aint pulling for them i see most people complain that they make it pw like bruh you cant make me pw if im broke they can add all those buffs that change the game but that doesnt mean i have to spend money not everyone plays and enjoy this game by cycle every end game content i play for the story and hot characters xd that doesnt mean i have to get them when i can see them in game
arivrsal nah theyll always find a way
blamehari i am a jade stan i fear i just used her as an example cause i know a lot of people hate her
zioclawilfr if the game becomes pw even story content will become so egregiously hard it wont be fun anymoreunless you swipe thats what pay win means
silverarrow in the face of defense shred from pelas ult its nothing and it would more likely have to be some sort of trigger to it like hitting a certain weakness of enemy
fisaliamamamiabadonkas not that scummy id expect something like that in genshit
why is it a problem r u the god balance they r forcing u to play in the most efficient way if u roll for statsmeta for a char u deslike u still doing it because u want anyway if global passives r profitable they will do some more obviously
rieru_ looks at flame reaver yeah that would be sad
kuhakuu while the revive in itself isnt super game breaking it still doesnt mean we wont get something absurd in the future like acheron came out and broke the game but then feixiao and ff matched her almost immediately also from what i have seen of the mechanic they remain at one hp for one turn and it doesnt matter if they get hit if they get a heal or shield before that one turn theyre fine i actually saw a play through of the moc on a channel where the entire team got one shot by the boss but castorice revive saved the run castorice becoming a demigod and is therefore op argument doesnt make sense really and considering that phainon and cyrene will be times more anticipated than castorice they will most definitely have global passives i enjoy the story too but you do realise that all the actual story bosses and stuff have certain mechanics that cater to the new characters like that flame reaver boss pretty difficult to clear normally without a shielder the new pollux boss is also tailormade for castorice
ofcourse they gonna cry they dont want castorice but now they also know theyre weak so theyd need to get her its mostly the weak gatekeeping players crying about this i myself wanted cas because shes dammn beautiful but this is even better
arivrsal ah yes you have two pela and can put a pela in every team cant you all our best teams have pela in them dont they
i see the issue yeah
araragikoyomi i also liked cas ever since amphoreus trailer dropped and the reason why i saved ever since i pulled fugue banner
araragikoyomi sorry to break your bubble but mydei performs just as good as cas and mind you he still doesnt have his bis team
cyrene will get that we can equip five characters we need to hope hoyo changes it
silverarrow ruan mei res pen can replace pelas defense shred same with tribbies res pen replacing ruan meis so yes i have characters i can replace with pelapela can be replaced by with acheron teams being an exception
silverarrow youre not breaking anyones bubble lil bro the weak players and people who barely manage to the moc are the kinda ones crying because they wanna gatekeep and ofcourse the people who never planned on pulling her your argument about mydei aint even related to my comment
silverarrow i have to disagree with aglaea take she did get doomposted because she did not powercreep other characters but she is in no way very hated
all the outrage is basically just people constantly projecting how in the future they just gonna spam global passives for characters keep in mind this trait of her is essentially only reserved for characters released during anniversary last year we had acheron and till to this day she is the only that has the instakill technique same with castorice with her global passive also if acheron sells so well why they didnt just introduce a character that can basically instakill an eliteboss enemy too castorice global passive is really mid too it literally just gives you hp and if you dont heal them or give them shield for turn they just gonna die again even without the enemy hitting you most players that grind endgames never ever have to worry about dying in the first place the only way this passive gonna be viable is in the highest difficulty of du and su expansions which is optional
have you been on hoyolab bro people hated her doomposting was also rampant yea but people were mad about that entire interrogation scene where she gets castorice to touch you if you fail there defo was hate but again depending on the content you saw you might not have felt that people hated her
silverarrowacheron is released with one shot technique that also means that its a precedent for a character that one shot elite then a boss then weekly boss then endgame would be clearable at the cost of technique point thats basically your thought process if you think those things i mention are bs compared to acheron technique then idk why you would think a one time revive that doesnt let you play in a sustainless team is comparable to global buff of spd and def shred because those are also bs compared to castorice revive
some people fr dont get the point did you just replace a four star with five star alternatives oml not everyone has every support bruh and again its all fun and games as long as its a character you like
araragikoyomi regular star moc guy here ive completed all the end game modes completely every patch since and i can still say that castorice having global passive is too broken and just unhealthy both for hsr and the gacha space and before yes ive already planned on pulling her and i will still do it i wont spend money for her tho since i just like her design your argument is just incredibly stupid why its simple there is no single actual reasonable argument that is rooted in logic and not just rooted in feelings you say that the ones hating castorice having a global passive are the ones who didnt want to pull for her but are forced to since theyre account is too weak either because they just started or because they reached a stagnant stage in mid game but isnt this just proving their point that castorices global passive is unhealthy for the game how can you even consider a character good if players are outright forced to pick her up and this is not even the main point of issue here the issue is just that everything you said is based on what you believe the truth is without any objective fact to back it up its like i just say that people who like castorices kit are dick sucking hoyoshills its dumb isnt it especially if i dont even explain why people should hate castorices kit thats what youre doing while the side that argues that castorice is bad is actually presenting some objective facts
abt the this already exist on many others gacha games
arivrsal wont happen bro most of the upcoming characters global passive are buffing them firstly saber she increase skills nd basic attack trace lvl by phainon increase atk and lastly cyrene increase max hp and spd but thank god all of them are my fave character and my gacha plan from the very start anyway
even on gaming standard that is just too broken and not a good mechanic overall essentially like per account that have castorice their games will be much more easier compared to those that dont have her
the problem here is that you keep mentioning that its forcing you to pull for the character even if you dont want to bro if thats the case the problem is yours youre forcing yourself because you feel like it if you dont like the character and it has a global passive dont go for it im sure that all the time youve been playing the game you havent had any problems getting through the endgame
shreggy can you give me a source or is it a trust me bro type of thing cause i follow leak and theres not a single mention about another global passive
but sadly the hoyodogs are too blind by this and just ive enough of hoyos bs that i stopped playing at patch that itself is evidence that the game is slowly turning into genshin
yes there are i doesnt really know who is the leaker but if you want to know you can watch homuboy sorry if the name was wrong but they dont use english he mentioned about the future global buffs also phainon global buffs used to be all character can use lightcone and cyrene was used to be increase the capacity of character in a team by charateam zard
and another one spectacularly misses the point acheron needs to be on the team to kill the enemies castorice doesnt need to be on the team to revive hence the entire global passive also acherons technique is much more comparable to natlan characters in genshin with all of their exploration utility doesnt do much for combat but its a nice qol thing
silverarrow yall too you young to worry and over think things
facelessstarcarver not hated but didnt sell well because of sunday
imo its the best if the want to release global buff not from some sort of rngwall character you dont guarantee to get castorice anyway right they should add it through other way like by clearing story etc for ex in cookie run kingdom from the early update they release a feature called laboratory so you can increase your cookies power by atk hp def etc by using production resources since the game itself was an rpgcity build game for hsr i guess it can be transformed similarly to the circuit system in the divergent universe but work for all content and instead of rng type of gacha to get it it will be more grindy since hsr itself is lack of content for me
silverarrow except that theres literally content in the game that doesnt let you swap to acheron to use her technique and then swap back to your actual team so its literally an account buff but more scuffed because it forces you to swap to her and castorice passive is also qol if you play sustainless then your team would stay dead because it requires healshield before the next turn if you play sustain and youre still experiencing death on your team its either a build issue or theres more concerning problem with the boss balancing so the only time where it actually matter is if youre new and only have natasha and march for sustain or rng like hoolay locking one of your team time in a row it doesnt affect what you can achieve in endgame at all beside having to restart due to bad rng
arivrsal diff dev team yea but still same company so the scuminess can still be in effect v
so whos gonna tell this dude this is also the reaction of people whos only dipped their toes into gacha
rinn_qwerty cmon now we all have that one guy who will come forward and say been since st patch and all that bs whats even your point ive been seeing how the hsr community keeps growing more and more toxic and have a problem with each and everything thats being released as per you good points that the castorice haters are getting up in my view is absolute bs because that means in the long run we are only going to have character that have nothing special atall similar skill sets like what am i gonna do with characters that have instakil like acheron or running fast like feixiao this is a long term game there should definitely be stuff that makes the game easier over time for people and this stuff should be different from any existing characters global passives seem the best way to start it and the way yall make it sound is like cas is buffing cd is she no shes not shes reviving a character i can imagine to what length hsrs community stupidity would go to if the global passive was actually an atk boost or speed boost of sorts i just cannot see straight with a fandom that hates on everything and goes toxic sorry boss you may be a meta guy but im someone who plays this game to enjoy
the only thing they have to do is create a switch off button for thisn
shreggy lying out your ahh in here man lmao provide the sources if you got it i quite literally deep dive into leaks and never in my life have seen any info nor bread crumbs regarding the stuff that you just mentioned
i guess well just have to play the game as long as its still fun then
itsbiox i just forgot the name this fandom is really toxic huh
i guess well just have to play the game as long as its fun then
lunafreya its an interesting aspect but i dont think anyone who has the feature would opt to use it
shreggy basic excuse when someone just lied out of their ahh aint no way you remember the every details of said info and just suddenly forgot the source lmao fake leaks and infos are spreading like wildfire out here man
silverarrow theres no point its only you and the over thinkers point the only problem is the problem you make inside your heads stop over thinking if youre not having fun anymore playing games then just quit if you really have concern say it to the survey the devs send and hope for the best and wait the game is not even pvp they already acknowledged the issue regarding power crept so theyre looking into it if only people would only stop getting swayed by the exaggerations that most cc do to get more views on their content this community will become much better
i just saw it turn from likes to k likes in real time lmao
i dont believe they gonna add the stat boost global passives i do believe its a one time thing and well if they do add it if hsr becomes more generous so you are able to get em if you want and everything isnt necessarily a must pull its not gonna be an issue
itsbiox i guess my comment doesnt sent let me sent it again
itsbiox and yeah theres a lot of fake leaks and infos nowadays thats why i take everything with a grain of salt
shreggy this is really a crucial time where fake leaks or just some made up bs can spread like crazy and some people thats oblivious to these will accept it as hard facts i actually stumble upon some reddit posts talking about said infos but then again they dont have a legitimate evidence for it basically just goes on trust me bro basis
shreggy source that actually reliable is only to an extend of the next version and some bread crumbs for the version after that if theres a leak of things that is way more ahead than than i can assure you that its either fake or something thats going to change
zard thats why i take everything with grain of salt and it cam give a little insight about cyrene and phainon being another global buff char wich is obvious for me because they were like the icon for this update and phainon being some kind the mc of amphoreus i mean he was the first we met and hes also a kevin expy so it wouldnt be weird for cyrene she is obviously elysia expy because they share teh same va just like how raiden expys shares teh same va
shreggy its obvious because this one leaker that no one know about and the one that knew literally dont even remember where he find it said so yeah no lol also actual reliable leaker this is the icon for castorice revive literally the next day my bad its just a buff icon for castorice not her revive leaker saying anything doesnt make it obvious at all even when its from beta let alone some random one that you cant even give the source from
kingjoee yeah like using a break team to defeat an enemy that needs to be weakness broken like nikador that needs an aoe team to defeat it faster
youre so real i dont really play hsr but im really scared that global passives might become a thing in other games too i would be very disappointed if zz turned this greedy
possibly okay not yet so stop yapping
zard i give the source please read again or this fandom is really that illiterate
zard and who said it make that obvious i only said that we can get a little a view for the upcoming characters its people fault anyway if they trust leaks
silverarrow hardly i dont really go for female characters
lol dayum this has become a long hotly contested thread
shreggy i forgot the name no you didnt give me the source its obvious for me i literally just quote what you said i guess im illiterate for repeating what you said lmao
zard the source is uncle titanoboa my replies keep not sending so sorry if you waited
zard if you want it just tell me ill give you my dc the link keep not sending ive tried my best for minutes of trying
i feel like this is moreso around whatifs and nothing factual its why im not buying the hate on it until whatever they say is proven there is yet to be evidence to support the claims that hoyo wouldcould do this to other characters and or have it worse its all based on speculation and opinion and no facts to prove it if you pull for castorice im guessing youre gonna be using her so her being off the team isnt that worried about if you dont use her after pulling her and she revives youyoure still gonna die if you suck if you have a solid team there isnt a need to worry about castorice in fact her helping once isnice but you can still very much die again
miyukawaski youre the only one here who isnt arguing your comment just gives off chill guy who has fun from observing miniscule stuff energy
hahaha
the are already many gachas that use such things hell i play one that literally everything you have chars weapons itens skins give boosts to your team so yes i am afraid that hoyo may fall this path why
cry and whining the ultimatum level are you not tired of yourself
francee__ speaking about leaks here the global passives will have a dedicated menu to show which ones are in effect in combat so it will not be one and more will probably come fast phainon or cyrene is my guess
castorice playstyle will never b risky the best way to regain her ult is healing and if you get t hp polux takes the damage instead of the teammate
i like to think the devs know what theyre doing and have a clear business plan for the game but yeah who knows maybe this strategy will backfire
francee__ dont like the mechanics that can affect the entire future and difficulty of the game and other games dont play lmao what kind of argument is that the game already has an abnormal lack of balance just characters broken one after another since and you think this wont affect the future of the game try defeating a strong boss with gepard or himeko it will tell you a lot about how this can impact the future of game
toosmoofoyou true but if everyone was waiting until its confirmed then it would be rather too late to complain
its not that deep bro silverarrow
nah were listening to the community the loud minority of it but we just don care its a cool and unique ability its honestly not that deep also the devs dont have to listen to anyone its their game they can make any character they want thats like if you were an author and you really liked a character but the loud minority of your readers didnt would you write them outchange them no you wouldnt
and it seems like the attacks of pollux including its nuclear blow after the expenditure of his total hp also restore the hp to all members of the team correct me if it is not
glazers of the comments are discussing the passive and its split between people for and against it youre making up stuff atp also no ones forcing anyone to do anything you can go just fine without her her passive is just an added bonus like any other character no ones at fault for people not having the self control to choose not to pick her thats a problem on them your statement makes it seem that if they actually go through with the changes that it takes away the players choice you still have the choice to pick the character you like regardless this isnt some change thatll make the game unplayable unless you pick a certain character
is that a bad thing people will work around the mechanic to make more devilish playstyle and it is interesting
francee__ you actually nailed it they have a business plan since they are a company its not make all of the player wishes true plan at the end of the day they have to incite to spend more one way or another i just hope it stay very limited but i already see a way to punish castorice nonowners or those who dont minmax their accounts
rinn_qwerty month from now her passive will be considered mid because you can always step up the game and thats what they try with every single character from now what if the next update is in a realm with an area dot after each cycle like in sam boss fight your hp revival would be completely useless so everyone stop the crying and keep pulling for the characters you enjoy
yess just pull the characters you want i really love your intake
stat buffs kinda already happen in hi through divine keys not sure if this counts though if its not then imma just remove this
makisky my brother in christ the feature is going live
nousername truee
julia_lopez cant wait my brother ready to move on to next controversy ppl dont like
makisky but the fact of the matter is if she sells well and she will that will be their excuse to make more global passives it starts off with cass revive but what happens if the next passive is crit rate or crit damage or attack or break effect or a healer who just gives your account extra healing output these are very obvious ways that hoyo could exploit the global passives to make characters absolute must haves and its better to just not have the passives at all
aglaea isnt widely detested in any sense lmao
fisaliamamamiabadonkas both genshin and hi have global passives
francee__ its already been leaked that at least more characters in x will have a global passive no matter what way you twist this it is anticonsumer do not defend a billion dollar company for implementing fomo on a character you think is hot it powercreeps old units more than their current issue it forces players to keep pulling as many characters as they can to boost their account castorice is by all means a must have due to her kit and her passive the future units will also be must haves due to their global passive alone and before you claim that the leaks may not be real let me remind you that hoyoverse leaks are insanely proven to be correct remember the firefly is sam theory before the trailer even got released or how about this situation where leaks showed months in advance that this was gonna happen or maybe that s world is based off greek mythology and the hi flamechasers the list goes on and on go on older videos that came out far before their respective updates and you will see that the leaks are next to always accurate this is not a game of will it or wont it it will happen in a game already suffering from a humongous power creep issue a reminder that hoyo games by history since honkai impact rd set precedent in other gacha games so this issue is also going to spread into other games one way or another its happened nearly every time as a lover of hsr myself who has been playing since the cbt this game has increasing been implementing anti consumer practices with no sign of stopping once more i remind you stop defending a billion dollar company making financial gain only decisions that ruin your beloved game global passives are not good when they are implemented on limited time characters if it were placed on the mc or the main astral express crew most standard units then it would be different because everyone has them but castorice and the future characters for the foreseeable future are limited time
mrapplejuice be reasonable and kinda update with the times theres no way you ppl would be using old characters like gepard for months and months let alone years
mrapplejuice your expectations are your problems
i agree with your st point the revive is fine its basically like bailu the problem is that it activates when she isnt in the team and that wont be changed due to the laws over there if im not wrong only hope is that the backlash wont make them do any more global passives and that they atleast make a setting to turn castorice global passive off so that it only works for teams shes actually in
aetherald wjat is the global passive in hi i havent played that game in a long time so idk and for genhsin it was from that gamemode the theatre one i think im still new to genshin so i dont really know about the newest endgame content
meta slaves have already started ruining the community long ago this is like a small minority of the community at large by the way
shreggy for hi its minor boost to stats like atk you get from pulling certain weapons it barely had any effect in end game for genshin its utility passives like shoguns mora cost while upgrading
oh believe me future passive will get more absurd also this global passive is throwing power scalling out of the window since now cast is way stronger than emanator level characters
aetherald how many weapons there are btw global passive also is exits on other ha ha games as well like in cookie run kingdom etc
enemy debuffs are bad too arivrsal
shreggy iirc theres a few but you can only get of them to give you global stats and idc how other games do their global passives i care about how mhy has done theirs im not gonna use another games monetary tactics to predict how another will do theirs
aetherald thats a lot anyways what is iirc
makisky of course not i never said that eventually as in any live service the old characters will not be as good that is basic gaming expectations i never once expected selee to be the top tier dps for the rest of time or for gepard to be the infinite tank her was in but there is a very big difference between expecting general character balance and removal of fomo releases and expecting for every character to somehow be on the same level hsr has an hp inflation powercreeping issue with generally recent units that were released less than a year ago that already dragged some people away but this global passive is adding something on top i ask every defender here what exactly is the issue with the gobal passive being on the mc or only when castorice is on the team the answer is none at all the same goes for the future units that will undeniable have global passives in greater form because and i will say this very clearly castorices passive in itself is not overpowered dying has never been an issue in this game the issue has never been the power of castorices passive but its implementation ignoring any sort of critsism to the game state does not help you make the game better it is entirely fair for me and other to say that we do not want characters made fomo while older characters who were released less than a year ago get their kits power crept locking a global buff behind a gambling paywall is anti consumer the second a good global passive is put behind a character you dont actually want you or others who are actively defending this will start complaining only for this community to again backtrack and start defending that during the powercreep debacle this communities arguement against ccs were stop using x units when next to no one even uses them anymore then when the castorice leaks came out this community defended it by saying its beta test only itll get removed only for that to be proven wrong now we are at this point where many of you are saying oh itll only be on her with no sort of proof to even back it up if you do not believe me on any of these points go right ahead and backtrack videos on these discussions its hypocritical when do you guys stop sucking the developers cock and draw a line i seriously wonder the global passive is anti consumer end of fucking story it isnt that hard to tell it is and yet you defend it with a shield and sword in hand
arivrsal keep coping hoyoshill
arivrsal there is nothing impossible in hoyoverse game btw
kaminomaho and yet you have a hoyo game as ur pfp weird
yes its sa d to see this take effect to my fav game i ever play
u sound pressed is ppl being critical abt things they like an issue to you are you
facelessstarcarver ur crazy both characters have huge fanbase and i think jade has even bigger than aglea there are like no characters in hsr from star roster that dont have big fanbase
francee__ leaks say that phainon will be next character to have global passive so idk
i guess well have to wait and see what they come up with but i doubt itll be something like a cd increase or a speed buff
lets wait and enjoy the game in the meantime then
dude its literally just a revive most endgame users arent going to need her to do endgame content so many people getting upset at qol characters that have skills that arent gamebreaking if ur not dying every battle like oh no a character with a passive ill probably only use once a blue moon so broken if ur dying often enough for her passive to be used enough to be considered game breaking thats literally just you having a skill issue maybe use a healer thats built maybe use a shielder thats built
me a ggz player first time
arivrsal theres leaks about characters that have a global passive increasing stats already lmao
there already have incoming characters that has global passive too according to leaks
francee__ not to scare you but phainon cyrene and the limited character from fate collab probably saber is already rumored to have global passives so youre not waiting long for another global passive comes if the rumors are true
zard bro you just compared a mechanic best used to farm materials in overworld or su to one that applies in endgame theres a reason why acherons mechanic wasnt controversial because at best its a qol for su same for feixiaos or sparkles its pretty different you can only relate them that way if you are stupid and i think you are they are breaching the endgames with this passive and now sets a standard for the next shiny basic bth after castorice had it been outside of endgame and only when cast is in the team like every other qol mechanic in the game trust me no one will complain
pepegaphone a qol is qol regardless where you use it and i can argue that simulated is also an endgame as it has repeatable content and reward and is constantly getting update but every days instead of every month like moc and it is the best place for acheron technique to use just what is the benefit of having one time revive that cant be used without sustain if you dont play sustain then your character would be dead on the next turn if you play good sustain and still dead i can assure you it is a build issue if there is a boss that is getting released and able to killed you even with good sustain then the boss are the one that is concerning so then the only time its actually matter is if an rng fked you over once every battle like if hoolay hit one character times in a row castorice passive dont increase your ceiling of your run just the way global stat boost does it just save you from restarting a run if that its actually rng chance do happen if youre concerned that this would be a precedent then i literally show you how acheron which mind you the anniversary unit is still the only one that can one shot why do you think we cant have talent for one shot elite or boss or weekly it literally doesnt matter for endgame according to you but its still a big qol right it literally the same thing as comparing castorice global buff with like cdmg or something its not comparable whatsoever you can comeback and flame me if that indeed happen but i cant see a world where they implement global buff that isnt just qol
also the leaks are fake i can say so because ubatcha one of the most reliable leaker said the fate collab are hunt and nihility while uncle tiitanoba or whoever it is that i never even heard of said that saber is remembrance its still a leak and up to you for who to believe but i have to say youre more stupid to take some random leaker that no one knows about than ubatcha which has been proven right more often than not
silverarrow cmiiw but i heard that the passive doesnt work in moc i could be wrong given how the beta had about updates
sweeleongng let me guess phainon and cyrene
i guess ill just enjoy the game as long as its still fun then
essentially forcing you to pull characters you otherwise dislike is how i felt during ruan meis era i never did though
makisky not what if but likely possible when instead of if
cry me a river karen
makisky it is literally not a what if leakers have confirmed four global passive are on the way honestly i am not surprised
arivrsal its hoyo there will be possibility as long its profit and not too wayy broken they will do it maybe
bubi the cn community has been saying they dont want global passives getting out of hand just a little reminder last time a cn hoyoshill got a little mad dawei was almost killed
silverarrow mydei the king
mayo what i dont even know how to feel about that probably negative since its literally want a new game feature get this character
stat boosts will never happen for global passive it permanently ruins some relic sets p effects
just admit you have skill issues
pillowhead this game takes no skill a level player can pull an e sunday first try and a whale might have to pull dozens of times
dumb
its not its literally slap in the face
gachagaming diablo immortal isnt pay to win because im not participating in the mtx
ennryuo if you genuinely think youre forced to pull for a character then thats just your gambling addiction speaking
cant wait for you to complain about a character giving everyone spd globally and you dont have the pulls to get them
catsume im someone that wouldnt complain about anything and i dont see that happening pulling the character isnt even necessary if you dont want the character
finally someone that gets it
you must have the worst luck if you need for a c
at the end of the day if you can clear endgame content you dont need it people can be so dense to this point edit at the end of the day will you still play the game regardless thats the question you should be asking rather than creating needless drama thats how dense you guys are
its honestly not a bad but also not a good thing all i can say
most of the complaints are from western side not many people care in the china or japan or skorea its mostly just x
resurection skill is not bad but if skill give immortality that is the real op skill
i mean it does help a little to actually deal with the power creep a buff that remains even when the character itself has become too weak to use in newer teams makes it so it doesnt feel like a waste to pull it
ultra smaashh castorice next
i love how people randomly say this game sucks cause is pay to win a game needs to have two things to be pay to win it has to be a pvp game lets say fortnite and a shop where you can shop immense buffs hsr its not pay to win no pvp a game like fortnite its not pay to win a game like clash royale is pay to win
to be honest if it was just if she was on the team i think it would be fine im still rolling for her but that decision was made when she was first revealed
if you are like strong enough you literally cant die so theres no use of the revive its not like it buffs crit rate or crit dmg however the argument that this allows hoyo to do more stuff like this in the future which can probably buff atk or crit makes sense so ig we can only hope they dont do that and that this is the first and last one ig
i was gonna say at first the it was similar to bailu as she revives a teammate once per battle but then it said it happend even if she isnt in the party
global passive will let you insta clear moc
the problem is not the passive itself as other people think its the fact that they might get away with it and add more characters but with other effects like dmg boost or healing over time castorices passive is actually bad when you think about it revive with one hp but think about how will upcoming characters global passive will be if hoyo got away with it
finally something to make me go cold turkey on this game
its a precedent for something worse in the future but it shouldnt stop you from enjoying the game right now had people telling me dont let the anniversary rewards deter you bro remember the global passive ill keep pushing them to address this issue but ill give credit where its due
xs complains sleep
even if it is lore accurate im not good with that not only because of castorice we could partially ignore that because dying is kind of skill issue or lack of farming no offense and in the end unless you have bad luck it wont change the good runs the problem will be even worse when they add global passives that increases things like atk or hp
for me it just feels like we got destruction blessing outside su and du lol
i already was gonna get castorice since there only character character has revive kit not counting self revive but other then that i see it as bonus for character i like
some will be sad some will be happy life goes on anyway e ruan mei woohoo
bailu got power creep even though shes not the best
by the time your dumbass wont even be able to clear story boss because of hp inflation or end game mode having a boss that has a attack that can one hit ko you which is literally nikado btw hm and so many future global passive like crit rate and damage hp boost all res pen literally if you miss any of them your account is literally weaker than everyone else
you lack future vision
lack problems comprehension skill
nah if the end game content caters to their global buffs what you going to do
chrono here come the fucking glazers like star rail universe and many more that will glaze this global passive when it a bad thing and spoilers the next few characters has crit rate and crit damage and another has hp boost global passive so yh the game is officially cooked
heres the thing you cant i tried clearing moc with dot team all es hyper investment spd rm with be spd kafka in battle with k atk s gnsw spd in battle bs with ehr and k atk spd in battle k def aventurine and it took cycles to clear the first side theres absolutely a problem if i cant clear endgame with all limited untis that i pretty much used pulls to get them
i used to be able to clear end game content but i cant anymore because i havent pull new units u are the dense one for not seeing the problem
how ironic cause youre actually the dense person in this case you seriously dont think these global passive will affect future endgame content
vinzolaguer at the end of the day will you still play the game regardless thats the question you should be asking rather than creating needless drama thats how dense you guys are
catsume cycle thats stars no still considered clearing not unlike getting defeated or getting star
cloudchaser that seems to be your problem how is it everyone elses
chrono thats an insane amount of cope i didnt give those characters hours of work building them and another just to get the pulls and only clear with stars may i remind you i clear only the first side with cycles
catsume i wonder whos coping here the one complaining or the one enjoying the game lol i dont pull all the time but i still clear endgame with stars aiming for stars and then complaining youre not getting it and saying you need the current characters thats coping
chrono i quit and keep doomposting this game
chrono maybe i gonna make a content about this game how bad it is after i quit so a dense people like you will be so mad
chrono you know youre pretty much coping yourself with oh everything is fine get real
catsume i pretty much accepted i wont be getting every unit or lc and im still able to clear most game modes adequately you instead are crying foul on things you think you need to clear the game this game is literally fp not pw that is as real as it gets the sooner you get that the better your life will be do not bother replying since its clear you refuse to acknowledge who is actually coping in a fp game
chrono my life never been better than before after taking breaks from these bloodsucking games having the time and money to play better games like elden ring what you do here is mindless consuming you just eat whether put on to your table like a fucking dog while here i am having quality time with characters i love and want the best for them while the devs ruin it by making them not be able to clear content or directly make other characters better to such a degree that it feels bad to even use them get the characters you want or dont i dont give a literal fuck but what im gonna do is complain so the devs will push themselves to become better while youre going out like a zombie eating the very shit you lay on ground everyday oh and also dont bother replying cuz youre useless in a sense that matters go with defending your multimillion dollar company
i find the community to be a bit hard sometimes if you can clear story content thats already okay i straight up dont understand meta slaves and their continuously running loudspeakers
sam_hue thats the point im trying to highlight but clearly these people are too dumb to listen
qibliqt its only negative what
i live in ph and people here also likes complaining about everything too so its not just western any countries who know how to speak english
there are many of them around facebook not just twitter
arked thats called confirmation bias if you dont interact with chinese people on bilibili than youd think that theyre all eating this up when theyre not
arked thats called confirmation bias my young naive friend if you never spoken to a chinese player on bilibili youd think it was sunshine and rainbows over there when its clearly not
dannympdq oh good sir if that was the case then hoyo would be singing a different language because of the player base is chinese to be exact million players so if the chinese players actually retaliated in a large number the live stream would have turned out to be different they care about their chinese players more then your expecting so ironically you are naive to think that they wouldnt care about their biggest player base edit if they actually retaliated in a large scale but they haventyet
sheenaleona im also from ph but i dont use fb or x are there really many complaining about castorice
yes there are a lot around groups and pages not just her but other details as well
dumb
theyre giving me candy now but poisoning me later so its okay
being single player doesnt suddenly make paying for power not a problem you know why do you think people get angry when assassins creed puts too much qol behind a paywall the main thing about making a global passive is that it opens up the possibility of more global passives and once you release something like a crit dmg global passive it raises the overall health pool of bosses if this was zz i would trust it a little more since their hp inflation is very low but hsr has shown time snd time again theyre willing to make bosses ultra tanky to non new characters btw i dont play hsr anymore so i am only going by what others say but theres a reason why i dont play it anymore these days i got zz and it feels way more fair and allows me to even use corin one of the worst characters in game to clear content
all that mental gymnastics just cape for the game
this is a horrible argument by this logic diablo immortal isnt pw because its pve
authenticinarifox ubisoft drops a game that lets you unlock the entire maps collectibles for and everybody loses their minds hoyoverse crashes their own meta every month and people eat it up everytime
authenticinarifox so let me get this straight people complain when ubisoft lets you pay to unlock the entire map for but somehow are okay with this
okay thats a bad take cause pw can exist in single player games the whole point of pw is just paying for an easy advantage and lets say they add a character who will increase spd by then another comes with crit boosts etc etc and lets just remember end game content is scaled by the newest characters coming out and unless you got a big bank its gonna be an immediate disadvantage and alot harder cause the developers want you to get your bank out to have a better easier time like pvp so your argument just falls flat
dannympdq everyone is fine with hoyoverse does it for some reason
its just another pros on why we get her
randomviewer nope
randomviewerand then more characters with similar global passives come out and u cant keep up with rolling them making you miss out on important account buffs phainon cyrene etc atk hp aspd global buff incoming
iliveforchips yeah its not an issue for them coz theyre getting her and shes really popular imagine they put a broken passive on a mid male character with mid design mid personality mid kit in battle but broken passive people will riot lol
only then will they realize that their little queen of death wasnt so special after all lmao
another thing is that they may just add more shot mechanics to bypass current levels of survivability and her passive existing emboldens them to put them in
not only that but unlike bailu this can ressurrect multiple people at once
bailu can only per once by revive them
or x if she has e
imo it should only be if she is in the team and party having it be passive does sound very pw
i thought bailing can revive once per ultimate was i wrong
yes you are mistaken
uncoollotus ah yes the other incarnation of dan feng bailing
genesys so is fu xuan js non existence
haha limbus company already succeed with this with support passive
scarycandyman must be nice
and she is a fking dps btw thats suppose to be abundance job btw castorice is just every role smash into a mess of a character
genesys fu xuan e can revive the whole team
literally just had the exact same thought process
and you can expect this skill but its debuff the next time it reappears in the future hsr has become a disgrace to all turnbased game ever made
riojaneiro im not doomposting and just judge when its released
oh no shes better than a trash standard star what ever will we do
scarycandyman kolijanari sneak
the revive only works if you heal the unit back if you have a unit during in your team your are either sustainless or having massive skill issues
bailugaming right because of course we dont already have a bunch of characters with passive and mass healingshielding if you get them to a high enough constellation and their lightcones they got powercrept so they dont matter hoyoverse got the playets covered new stars that just so happen to play off castorice like hyacine hyacine the remembrance healer who happens to increase her personal damage based off of the amount of life drain inflicted on teamates and memo spirits she has an amazing light cone that causes even more life drain and if you get her next constellation that personal damage outscales mydei did i mention shes a healer because she heals like loucha but better
ivamuyargas ese ingls esta mal
it also revives any teammate that gets downed if im not mistaken where as bailu is a and done
typemoonfansashi considering the leads doomposting may be appropriate as there are apparently already others characters that are planned to have global passives in other words the power creep which is already really bad is about to get much worse
bring bailu as healer and you get revives with her e
scarycandyman my bro does not understand what global means
lmao i remembered how some npcs or someone sold fakei think they were romantic journals about legendary dan fang and jimm yuang heppelhopv
lol
coming back to this in years and will probably be true
notcbt hey if it gets added then just pull the character never upgrade them and call it a day maybe people can finally clear moc for once in their life
that would be great though that mean even lvl player can clear it now people still having hard time clearing moc
honestly i highly doubt there will be any more global passives and if there are i also highly doubt it will be related to damageplease let this comment age well
foxyuushaz oh my i hope this is satire
im_motivatedayato yes because everyone is a whale who just have the funds to get everyone in the game what type of dumbass logic is this
tbf acheron did it first she doesnt even have to get into battle just smack em dead elite enemies aside
dont give them ideas
foxyuushaz no way fp players can win every
womp womp cybaby
will never happen and ofc lemme joke too ok
no need new global passive available on according to leaks
lmaoo
battlebroleaks for the fates collab is that all the characters have global passives its the president that this sets that people are upset about and they are likely going to go though with it and destroy all the good will they had with their community
hoyo will do this for sure a true zero cycle
cut the crying bullshit
collect all global passive then just press auto
and all of the whaler will cry i guess
theyll add characters like this regardless of peoples opinions anyway itd be great if hoyo listened to criticism from the people who fund their game
come on man are you forgetting that theyre also buffing up the enemys as well like the upcoming boss will completely ignore the defence and shield and im sure there will be more enemies who will be even more powerful in the future
glooze cuz they know people will still play regardless
what about new whale system npc still looks like shit characters yapping like robots lack of events less rewards hoyo cares only about milking players
yeah you are right and the hp inflation is going to be wild im imagining in x or plus new bosses hps will be m average in the overworld
these are other problems with the game but my comment was about the predatory global passive im not ignoring these problems tho
as long as cn is satisfied they aint doing shit
statwise buffs out of battle from global passives could happen but its not gonna be on all chars in a teamaccount and its not gonna be must pull also shes an anniversary character shes gonna be op obviously
hyperscalerafsan as long as cn keeps sucking off hoyoverse
naw her ability is op say your entire team gets wiped at once she can bring them all back to life now usually an attack like that would give characters back a lot of energy so your healer should have their heal up to get everyone up and they should have ults to counter attack
arked quite agread with you bro
her passive is not bad in the slightest its extremely overpowered to be a global passive if your whole team gets wiped at the same time they all come back hp does not matter because they also become immune to death until they are healed or get a shield so the passive itself is part of the problem
xenowars i mean it might be good for early game accounts but for established accounts i dont think its that crazy my characters rarely dies in endgame content
death is something thats related her character so it only makes sense if youre not happy with it dont pull same goes for following characters with similar passives
ermm i love the character so much she is actually my favorite hsr character and im saving for her and her light cone and i actually pulled for tribbie just for her shocking right i just dont suppor this global passive so get this idea out of your mind yes i will not pull if i didnt like the character but she is a character that i love and want
they better not pull off that shit on zz or else imma quit that game too its better to call it out now before other gachagames copy this predatory tactics
arked thats exactly the problem tho you cant make a solution to absurd hp inflation and enemy buffs only available to people who pull for a specific character especially since its rlly not guaranteed you will manage to get said character even if you saved up for a long time and only rich ppl who spend on this game and want to get her are guaranteed to benefit from it it isnt fair
bro im an fp player and me and many others have been saving from quite a while the buff and everything you mentioned is specifically in the du or su or other end games and those buffs are still available for hp scaling characters like blade or mydei the only difference is how good is your team and your build the character its a skill issue rather then hoyo issues there is no absolute rule that if you dont follow the meta you cant do anything or youll lose everything
mysteriousweebx she can bring one back to life once per battle
no she has multi rez look at the video mihoyo played she revives both tb and tribbie
imagine in next anniv character when we get them our characters cant die again
yall too young to over think and worry
in optimal scenario imagine your healer is just energy away from ult without cas pass they will die but with cas passive they will get the energy and heal to remove the passive and completely revived so its not that bad its just make every sustain has a bailu passive with some restrictions
zayedqx is her passive disadvantage to you if not then pull if it is i doubt then dont pull theres no need for too much hate for global passive since it only gives advantage to your account and if you dont pull for a unit with global passive theres no disadvantage
hsr has become a disgrace to all turnbased game ever made
hyperscalerafsan hoyo does not listen to them either people did complain about the passive in chinese serves if i aint wrong
this is something that genshin is already implementing if leaks are to be believed with escoffier its not going away
they definitely wont do damage boost and healing overtime tho phinon will have a global passive with the day and night mechanic
felinedreamer yeah i heard that too when the beta was going on the mainland player were complaining oo
justdome and the skins
you can just always quit the game
i highly doubt theyll start handing out global passives like candy to multiple characters castorice is an anniversary character every gacha game in history has always given the anniversary units insanely broken kits last year we got acheron who had had crazy dmg with a technique that literally lets you skip entire battles if for some reason they do decide to add another global passive i feel like itd be for another anniversary in like years by then i imagine well have so many reruns of her enemies so strong that well look back realize this wasnt really that deep i get the skepticism but i genuinely think this passive will be unique to her everyones just jumping the gun assuming the worst
iori theres leaks about characters in x will have global passive some of them are stats buff and some of them are traces buff
arked the answer to powercreep is to not add even more powercreep and pw mechanics lmao do you even hear yourself
nigga what that is the most paranoid and sociopathic cope to validate immature responses the revive is just hp and doesnt immediately make the allies get their turn they have to heal to not stay dead and its once yall latch onto one thing and blow it up like karens actually nah you are the karens
glooze fund their game not a single western country is under the top most players or revenue countries they do listen the people they dont listen to just think they speak for the majority they do care for western players met devs and employees myself but it feels like bad faith screaming when i see its people cycle moc when i cant even clear it entirely at all
bye nobody will miss you and if you arent a spender hoyo wont miss you either
man just full quit hsr at this moment the armaggeddon is just begun now this will get much worser than you imagine
minuteman already done just moved to t and im having tons of fun
eliatomasi genuinely happy for you cuz i also quit hoyoverse games not too long ago hsr and zz cuz i already quit genshit years ago at around of honkai star rail
eliatomasi t is actually very beginner friendly in endgame despite being hard
i would at least just keep checking out the story then and there
goodbye
honestly with how stale the game has gotten i was just waiting for an excuse to finally drop it
okay see ya we dont want whiny babies anyway
and we dont wanna play a gacha game that has to amplify their already existing predatory tactics by good riddance hsr
im scared for statwise buffs but im not saying the game is dying over a single passive ik global passives will never ever make chars must pulls unless its a sustaining global passive and ur a sustainless team user but thats it and people calling it powercreep dont know what powercreep means
i cant enjoy the game when my black swankafka team that used to be able to clear all moc hit like wet noodle now
all i can hear are skill issues from the players
freyrisulfr all i hear is ignorance and media illiteracy from you nobody hates this passive because it helps skill issue they hate it because of the precedent it sets leaks already confirm future characters will also have these passives so it seems like our doom posting wasnt just us saying shit for attention
i will just not pull for castorice im letting her rot ill rather go for jiaoqiu and his lc and maybe anaxa just cuz i like the design but if they release anything else like castorice im not pulling them
this this is why i just filter out the complaints bc honestly ppl in hoyo games complain about so many things ill just be here enjoying the game thanks
ronreed this is like genshin and other gacha games the more you character releases the more power crept will be because thats how the industry works seele is now irrelevant on moc without proper build and support and other og meta new characters star new meta and new meta will be broken and new enemy will tougher you cant stay at it forever because someone cant cope with it and also you are exploring new planets on every update new tougher enemy and mechanics they follow the genshin formula update or generic gacha so dont even surprise by it
i dont enjoy doing dailies and use energy for months
ronreed and thats why you should learn when its sarcasm youre too serious lil bro
i stopped playing since the release of yunli deleted the game from my phone pc and ps its not enjoyable anymore for me by that time terrible powercreep utterly terrible writing and almost no effort to balance the game at all just clicked here because i was curious how the game worsened over time i went back to the fp game that actually reworks and rebalances their old characters and no gacha at all
agnesfodornevarga id recommend singleplayer games persona is a similar turnbased game and its quite a lot of fun
anikun_ sadly its not that similar to genshin for one simple reason genshin is so easy of a game that every character in can defeat every type of content from the game just not as easily as the recent characters meanwhile try using seele on the recent moc she wont do anything there
ronreed is a global passive disadvantage to your account
yeah thats real and the problem is hoyoverse is gatekeeping the characters with rng and rerun system i know play a game with worse powercreep the rarity system is basic one common rare epic legendary and everytime a new legendary released the last legendary character is demolished from the meta but the dev gives enough rewards from farming mail events etc for the player to get the characterwhat i mean is the character is free so the garage system rate up one is have a guarantee to get the rate up character at pull but the dev makes fp can reach that amount and its not that hard for newer player its still considered as hard for me thats why this game is not really noob friendly and the normal legendaries are mostly free even they added an event not anniversary when you streak login for days you can choose one of all the legendaries that already released at that time for free even they added a perma event where we can choose ancient a rarity that above legendaryfor each phase theres total of phase wich mean ancients out of ancients but hoyoverse doesnt do the same they make the gacha more harder while making the powercreep insaner for me its only one step away to reach the powercreep of that game ive played the game name is crk its just an abbreviation its kinda popular now so im sure theres a lot of people recognizing this game nowadays silverstar
cloudchaser so because of it you chose to cry about this on the internet
silverstar its actually the same already do you see klee as in dps on the spiral abyss like eveyone can do that or even worst fremi physical dps what i meant is the more games update the more it gets harder little by little so i didnt suprised because thats how gacha game works lol
anikun_ i am also not surprised but like genshin is very different with their spiral abyss th floor difficulty thats literally the one and only thing that they make it total bullshit and hard meanwhile the entire game story archon quests everything that you need to do to complete the games content beside the abyss can be easily beaten with any character including klee honkai star rail meanwhile already started its insane difficulty spike when that boss that came with ruan mei was launched every update a new boss comes that will be so difficult that the single character they launch in that version will be needed to pass trough it unless they make casual mode even more casual as i heard that they made this casual mode so ppl can pass trough the story
silverstar the problem is the whale will whine again or meta slave savers goldfish spender or mihoyo wants some cash its no in between i dont know whats their cooking but all games have recently hard for me as fp they burning the kitchen if this thing continues which is definitely are and about klee you cant beat the last spiral abyss and now because the given health on boss and elite enemies are insane also the infuriating part that only natlan characters can benefit on the buff last time spiral abyss so in the end they are definitely the same spiking there and that also zz the last event i didnt even beat it its like mihoyo wants u to be whale or fish for some reason
anikun_ again you repeated the same thing that i said we shouldnt focus on when comparing the powercreep between hsr and genshin you are indeed correct with everything you said but i am trying to point out how hsr is being way worse with it than genshin abyss and moc have the same problem but what differentiate between genshin powercreep and hsr powercreep is the story bosses the last boss we saw can be defeated by any character or any team will struggle more than the optimal team yeah ppl will but its way easier than how much someone with only characters fight last story boss on hsr so much so hsr had to make casual mode but genshin has nothing like that
silverstar i said the problem is the whale is gonna whine again or mihoyo wants a spare cash to grab in thats why theres many space between it because its different sentence it means that hoyo listen on the whale or people that wants the game harder this common trend before the spikes i can solo the moc only one character on moc is there no real end game for hsr this the most i always see the thing is community ask for this then regret later
silverstar and false also the thing is that spiral abyss is time dependant only one stage are health dependant which means that if you need to be good on this and wise pulling but other than that its already presence on the surface area of genshin you just didnt notice you will not get the primo if you dont have the meta in spiral abyss and if theres a new character releases automatically the buff on spiral abyss will align on that character or whatever character on that banner only x has buffs on spiral abyss that is so specific unlike before so argue with me if they arent milking both games including zz using difficulty spike and character gimmick lock stage
those replies originating from twitter told me all i need to know
but its all over hoyolab too
complaining twitter complaining china
brother these complaints exist on hoyolab too not to mention its chinese and japanese players criticizing this as well
dannympdq u know why bc most of income come from china not western lol
donquixotedoflamingo glazing gang hoyoverse doesnt listen to anyone
dannympdq try zz then comeback btw hoyoverse never listen to western only china so stop hopping they will listen to you if you not from chinese lol
ronreed oh i should say western not x lol
if hoyoverse really cared about lore accuracy then he shouldnt be allowed to die and jingliu should always fight on auto
i will said that just an excuse by the dev to make more money even in honkai impact there is character named seele who literally have a title herscher of deathrebirth death authorityshe can not revive the death character both in storylore and gameplay
you are thinking too small what if they add a character who increases your team size from to or doubles the energy regen rate of your team just by existing
acheron in the side with insta kill ability
mysteriousweebx at this point you are just delusional
instakill is only for overworld and sudu castorices passive affects moc pf and as jawbonedis
mysteriousweebx so we are all living in whatifs
jawbonedis does it work in the endgame does it work when shes not in the party
sumagestad i mean if u consider du an endgame then yes and the guy said its suppose to be lore accurate
jawbonedis du is a for fun endgame that isnt meant to be a massive challenge all rewards are collectible by just farming the lowest difficulty on vii your characters naturally become stronger than the enemies if you put any thought into it any higher difficulty can be done using preservation handedly also who even goes into combat domains in du
jawbonedis fr
so is it a disadvantage to your account
xeenoo ok a lot of comments let me see is not strictly a disadvantage but is not strictly a game changer too if you are good playing and you have good builds it would be hard to notice it increasing stats would be noticeable instantly
mysteriousweebx those are other dangerous options but i said atk and hp because if i recall correctly they were kind of leaked still a leak you dont need to trust me in that thing but is what i know
dannympdq jingliu fighting on auto is actually possible mydei does that xd
muhammadhanry yeah thats sad an also i think castorice is one of the most popular characters of x if not the top so possibly theyre doing this to get even more money from people that doesnt have interest in her at first
dlex so what is really the problem if it is not a disadvantage
jawbonedis thats not a problem acheron skill is a technique she must activate it and it only works with normal enemies on field thing that doesnt appear in endgame modes like moc or pf castorice revive thing is a passive skill that even activates when shes not in your team you can get her pity have her at level and that passive will still apply
dlex i only say it because it was related on the topic that u said about being lore accurate
jawbonedis thats true but the skill is not the same acheron does not affect inside battle xd
dlex yeah he just cancel this fight in general
well not everyone wants to be super competitive in a single player game
anael yup i know but is still a serious damage this
thats very karen logic oh no they added one crazy new idea and now it looks like nothing will stop them from changing everything so radically unless i stop them every nigga saying its bad for the game needs to calm the fuck down and actually see how it goes when it drops and for anyone who argues oh well it forces the character to be a must pull let me remind you that you have something called a choice not to get the fucking character its a fucking choice dudes yall acting like the russian government when something new comes out like you gotta gatekeep availability or something karens
so is thr problem u cant show off beating moc owning castorice or just the fear that people wont be able to cyvce it because i cant fully beat moc or any of these timed modes so castorice would certainly help cause i get sometimes oneshot anyway already and cant remember how many runs i did for a single relic set after i just kept what i got
honestly if they want lore accuracy they could have just made it into a story unlockable global passive something like after to her moment in her story she blesses us with something and it helps us in our future troubles making it so that the passive only activates when you have her in your account its just greed
i just wish it didnt get locked up behind a limited star like if it was a relic set or new equipment mechanic it would add to the game
faturramadhani if you think more this isnt actually op honestly hp cant really save you from enemies bombing it really depends on your sustain speed you could die by boss chain attacks or die by creep before your sustain turn
kuroujiutataha thats true but it affects me rn like its force the feeling i should get castorice over mydei and im stressing over it
faturramadhani play the game all your way my friend just enjoy the game with your way without seeing meta i honestly play hsr for fun and fill my free time after work
kuroujiutataha you missed the entire point this means future characters will have global passive like giving buffshield or even heal in the end you wont even need to play sustain or support anymore
muhammadhanry oh i didnt think that far my bad but for now we can relief because castorice passive is not really broken like it seems
faturramadhani getting both is optimal for meta
faturramadhani state your reason why you want to pull for her and why you wont then compare itare you pulling for meta character design lore if you find that you dont have any reason to pull for her then dont force yourself to create a reason to pull for her and blame the game its your fault not theirs
faturramadhani why why would u stress out because of that hp revive both mydei and cassie are crazy good enough without that global passive tag just choose whoever char that u need the most that would be good for your long term value and team comp dont make that global passive become the sole reason u pull for a char
eos insight
i still remember when silwer wolf released and many people scared about she can powercrept anything bcs of weakness implant but look now they still play hsr and keep update every patch lmao
kyaa she wasnt broken she was a tipping point a difference you fail to see hsr will lose so many content creators its insane
kingjthe for now yup but in her first released shes absolutely broken bruh bcs she have unique kit to counter almost all enemy and people keep overreacting like now but look at sw now no one cares about her and see her as fine character lol
kyaa you again lack the ability to comprehend beyond base value ill break this down for you silver wolf was the beginning of the end her weakness implant started to take away the strategy away from the strategy game now multiple units ignore weakness types anaxa implants all weaknesses castorice does everything possible and there will get to a point where castorice is seen as a horrible unit i personally dont think the game will live that long but whatever the global passives is taking away the players choice and is practically forcing you to pull characters with global passives
kingjthe sw was still a broken character before remember that no one cares about the meta bcs as long as they have sw and mono quantum team they literally can defeat any enemy about global passive characters its not a must pull tho no one forces u to pull the character u dont want its all about the build with the right build even characterslike xueyi can easily beat the moc
kyaa beat moc and with her not using new supports
she was powercreept when healers could remove debuffs from allies with skills and other mechanics
not only bailu fu xuan is also got power creep by her pet dragon who can take the team members damage
i all in
yh anyone that supports this dumb because guess what the next global passive characters has to do with damage and something else which i wont say since it leaks but yh the fomo will be insane
something similar to this is present in azure lane btw i am not sure but this isnt the first time something like this is made
im surprised you didnt cover this earlier
all in as in you support this do you realise this is gonna be the snowball effect right powercreep and fomo is already bad as it is and by encouraging this its only gonna get worse
teddyisaliar im pretty sure hoyo doesnt listen to criticism from fans this is very apparent in genshin for example
teddyisaliar i not support that matter i just want to pull her also i fp player and rarely play in moc or pure fiction
teddyisaliar as fp that has been clearing all endgame since idgaf about this update at all cause im enjoying the game regardless there are many gachas out there that are more pw than this with pvp content in it at least hsr doesnt
pillowhead and there is the problem just cause you think its okay doesnt mean it is okay its still a problem and you just ignored the point of what it means for the potential future if you cant actually acknowledge the broader situation then let me out it like this if you are a new player good luck if you are a returning player too bad your characters are outdated and unless you have the relics given to you by the hand of god best of luck and with global passives its gonna get to the point where unless you have a specific character you are always gonna be at an immediate disadvantage and with the constant meta changing the awful hp inflation the so called class roles being completely irrelevant now it doesnt set a good example and using the excuse of well others games its bad and they have pvp is literally a terrible scapegoat excuse cause its still a problem so trying to deflect just shows you are aware of it and just dont want to acknowledge if what you say is true then why is the star rail community actually uniting and saying this isnt a good thing and they really need to rethink this over and not been happy with her current state of the game recently
kinda ironic to say people are dumb while you are worried a literal games future as if you cant play it in the future
are you dumb this is how we were coping that castorice wont come to live but look at where we are
mlacc people used to think silver wolf was powercreep proof years ago
people keep saying just damage but you are thinking too small what if the be global passive allows you to have characters on a team
mysteriousweebx we can already have characters on team if theyre all remembrance
mems arent characters
mlacc well its more how much frustration and unfair its gonna be imagine a character comes out who gives crit rate and crit dmg for existing is this the kind of features we should be striving for
teddyisaliar wow thats crazy cant wait to get that now i can get cycle full auto in any endgame content sad this game doesnt have leaderboard
there are no shipgirls that could do that atm closest thing is the operation siren revive but with debuffs and a free equipment that can keep the shipgirl alive for seconds one game is a turn based and another is side scrolling danmaku entirely different games
also correct me if im wrong as i do not play al and certainly would not touch a hoyo game again with a foot pole but al gives you more rolls for free for technically less effort so even if an absolutely broken ass character comes out you have a fair chance to obtain it without the need to skip banners or suffer from being fed droplets of currency
zero absolutely they have a seasonal shop to redeem pullscubes using tickets just by running commissions commissions run in the background so youre not incentivised to leave the game open this happens times a year iirc
zero absolutely in to times in a year they have a seasonal shop where you can redeem pullscubes with tickets that you get from running commissions the commissions can run in the background so youre not incentivised to leave the game open or play longer ironically it is easier to get a super rare then getting an elite which is an equivalent of four star given that super rare rate is

uh oh gigguk ex is here how is wuwa doing with their convention oh yeah its crowded in japan
blud really out here pulling all strings just to make hsr less bad al is just so different on hsr and the meta there is how big a shipgirls ass and tits are
theres also something similar to the global passive idea in fire emblem heroes the emblem character gives something to buff one character on each of your team you might not want the character or think it will be powercreep easily but just because it can buff anyone in each of your teams you need it no question asked or youre just gonna destroyed by players that got them later on that was an issue i never saw reported when i was playing feh but it definitely should have
hes a hoyocreator i dont think hes allowed to cover leaked content
vr is he actually partnered with hoyo cuz i thought only partnered hoyo cc cant cover leaks
wind or maybe just because he doesnt want to post leaks thats it
beta information is inaccurate so we had to wait for hoyo to announce whether the passive was global or not this happened on the live it was better to wait for confirmation than to spread false information
if it was genshin related hed uploaded it weeks ago he gets the most views from negative genshin news
why hoyo why
i dont know if i ever cried this much in my life bro

ok algo que ame del pasado de castorice es que muchos la ven como una bendicin de los dioses por poner fin a la vida sin dolor pero ella lo ve como una maldicin por que siempre estuvo sola me encantoo este corto una maravilla y castorice me encanta
nokotan desu comes to my mind

i loved this come home soon castorice
this animated short made me sad
after watching this trailer made me realized why hoyo made that global passive for castorice
""
""
global passive
deserved for having global passive
oh it cant be right now im just tears
she is amumu from hsr
i like her short way more than firefly one a lot more strong emotions
this video make cry a lot
shes such a sweetheart
starrail is actually a game that is literally one piece
zeref from fairytail literally
why is everything so fking perfect in this game
so basically hoyoverse developers have one piece fans in them lol
good god i knew she had a sad backstory but i didnt think it would effect me so badly
that deer was locked tf in
c i n e m a
their heads are a little too big when they are younger but otherwise great animation
la cancion es demasiado similar a las tonadas de hird que gran historias nos mostraran
its more down to earth firefly was fighting a galatic war which is less relatable to people
cute i still dislike castorice
revivi el futbol seores
my baby
this animated short was quite literally horrifying and so artistically beautiful
poor castorice
castorice my beloved
all i do in this fandom is cry
wow this definitely has some frieren and violet evergarden vibes
love it looks amazing
that deer looked into my soul
cried beautiful character
seeing this video im sad about castorice because she cant touch anything or it will die
i understand why god gave me depression now it was all so i could hug castorice
this is no short or snack its a full course meal
hey guys now castorice can hug mydei because death does not take him away
she deserves much more
dang greek tragedified
omgthat was perfect
    
damn thats grim
she cant touch or hug anyone till she met her husband caelus
imagine being mad at her global passive when shes such an icon i love her
""
how old is she
how dare you make me cry on a random monday
u too greedy hoyo too greedy
esse curta me quebrou
me and my friends that only i can see
vro sounds like subaru natsuki
a classic
hoyoverse sleep with one eye open
this is just ymir from attack on titan my goat
why are you staring at me like that
very cool animation but unfortunately that doesnt change hoyos hands being cold
this is a wholesome and positive story a great man once said
absolute cinema
i can fix her stella
    
my shaylaa
its shionne all over again but much less painfull
at least a few hundred years who knows when this backstory takes place so a few hundred is a good estimate
depends on how ya look at it shionne didnt typically kill folks from touch just servere pain
why is this deer trying yo mog us
sadge
i started shedding tears when she hugged granny
watching this and crying during my microbiology class
sus deer
   
am i still playing a game i need a break from genshin leme play star rail star rail

facepurplecryingfacepurplecryingfacepurplecrying
still not enough to excuse predatory global passives
i dont like where it goes

oh deer this is tragic
did they remove her passive yet

its hurt really hurt right into my heart
this is going on my reasons for why i have mental breakdown
stellecaleus i will hug you forever
i just got into hsr im not crying youre crying eyespurplecrying
how were there days and nights when castorice was young i thought aquilas eyes were closed a long time before this
this is so sad yet so true
sad
oh this is such a beautiful anima qaq
close enough welcome home emilia
and then theyve announced only one anaxas video
   
trying to hold hands and dance with your shadow and relfection is some next level loneliness damn
wow
hoyo im crying
guys who tf is cutting onions rn
so sad
nice story still has passive still skipping
yep we know whos hoyos fave unit this version penacony was acheron
this hurt so much
this hurt man
this one hits a little different
castorice is incrediblee
oh
sadly im no longer a hsr playerbut if i was one until now castorice would definitely be my new main on my account because damn not only her gameplay is cool but her story got tears to my eyes and im not a person to cry over fictional stuff
this is so fate go coded
      
chinese poem by li bai

damn onion cutting ninjas
sobbing
they loved her so much they made this entire animation in game i love castorice and i wish i could hug her without dying
i cried too
they will start doing it from next update
next patch
it symbolises rebirth
castorice es inmortal perdon pero aun no llego a amphoreus
""
hoyo giveth hoyo taketh away giving my heart something to cherisch to rip it apart with a sad backstory
its sad that some others would consider her ability a blessing while she considers it a curse ex relieving people from slow death
gives me rogue from xmen vibes she cant physically touch anyone either if she touches a mutant she takes their powers and their memories if she touches a regular human they get knocked out and she takes their memories but if she holds on for too long she kills them
hoyoverse what did i just saw
damn its been a hot minute since an animation brought me to tears please i hope i win my
im not crying really
old friend sees castorice talks to her for a while holds her hand to comforts her pain dies from death touch refruses to elaborate further

beautiful well done
noo castoricee caassiee nnoo i am crying noo
this is insane tysm i love her so much more now
hi making and posting animations is optional fyi
con un demonio ahora tendre que tirar por ella hermoso el video
another wholesome and heartwarming moment thanks shaoji for this wonderful story that doesnt cause depression at all
and yet shes so quiet and doesnt freak out at all when we touch her in story
relatable
a herta
cool now how about using some animations like this in game thoughts
""
to be fair it has a hopeful ending
amphoreus story made me realize that shaojis writing is really subpar pacing i dont think he properly learned how to write
ogzz an ac fan saying that is ironic
parsashirali yeah even ac story is better overall in comparison thats how bad amphoreus is
because they were fighting flame reaver
plasticbeetle even after that she just brings it up in such a casual way shouldnt she be freaking out that theres someone she can actually interact with without causing them to die
expect extra gigabytes and cooked low spec phone
cinema i cried
why do english voice actors always ruin it so much they sound so uncanny
i hired this deer to stare at you
yes im crying a lot
estuvo un poco fuerte procede a llorar
i dont like castorice that much but damn
""
dont worry guys castorice will kill hsr with her touch but it will be reborn again maybe or not
absolute kino

why does hoyo have an active interest in making me cry
brutal

eu tava triste at aparecer o veado no final
i came happy i leave crying ill protect you castorice
sigo diciendo q si el juego por lo menos en esta parte de ampho ubieran echo la tematica aun mas romana y q de verdad se note las guerras en vez de hacer cinematicas negras y habladeria de paja bien aburrida y q el gameplay transmita lo mismo q una cinematica fuese aun mejor juego
context please why is everyone says this is sad
tbh this was so unnecessary like we re not even getting an animation for every chreisos heirs
now im crying t_t my tender death only death is always alone
chat is this frieren
hoyoverse makes me suffer and cry again with such animated stories
not sure which hit me harder this or fireflys trailer
i wonder how could she eat if anything she touch be dead and rotten

crying so fucjing hard rn
best anime visual ive ever watched
midas touch but death
global passive is justified shes sad no hate just facts
i will cry a thousand times if death even hurts me castorice told me that even though we fear death we still embrace it to see some people we know who died a thousand times for us to live and i know this is a crappy comment but im trying to express myself after watching this vid

this is what i was worried about that hoyo would make me desperately need to pull her with an animated short
im not watching all that
perhaps i sobbed uncontrollably
zeref
i admit i was crying inside it touched both my heart and soul castorice is like zeref from fairy tail
wow tt__tt
havent had a trailer this sad since firefly
i already knew i was gonna pull for her but after this im convinced even more
like fireflies to a flame life begets death
what will you have after years
wow way to suddenly make me cry i was gonna skip her banner because im scared waiting for elysia but now i have got to save her and bring her in my journey we cant leave her alone guys
they had to make this so sad for castorice didnt they
hits so much more knowing how she must feel now that she has found someone who she can hold
how dare you stab me multiple times
i cant tell if hoyo plays favorites with these trailers or if they just pick a random character and go you your get an animated trailer either way im ok with this
to em prantos
she should meet blade
younhave patches to save for elysia dont worr you will get her
oh my god
her power so strong shes gonna kill lol
a character who hates death but is blessed with granting fatality
one hug
im not crying its you guys
""
anyone hating on her now doesnt deserve her i hope you lose all your s from now on my poor baby
my heart just crumbled
this just became a horror short
this trailer felt like a whole anime
i really need to stop cutting onion while watching these

castorice would be deemed a god if she ever gets to liyu i meant xianzhou alliance

this animation just woow
she could probably be able to touch people and im just spitballing ideas here if they created a senario where her global passive didnt exist pretty sure everyone would like that
i feel bad for castorice all she wants is to feel and she cant
poor castorice she really just need a warm hug
min i hear a faint tatakae i fear
soo does anyone know if castorice death touch works on robots svarog alongside tb could probably hold her hands
